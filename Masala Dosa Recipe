  <strong>How to make Masala Dosa</strong>
  <em>
  <ol>
    <li>Masala Dosa is one of the most popular South Indian delicacies.
      Here’s how you can prepare this delicious recipe at home! To prepare the batter for Masala Dosa, wash and soak the rice (with fenugreek added into it) and urad dal in separate containers for approximately 6-8 hours.
      Once the rice and urad dal are soaked well, grind them separately in a mixer using the water in which they were soaked till the mixture gets a smooth consistency.
      Take the batter of both the ingredients in a bigger container and add salt to it. Mix well and allow it to ferment overnight.</li>
    <li>For preparing the filling of the dosa, heat oil in a thick-bottomed pan and let the mustard seeds splutter.
      Then, add sliced onions, curry leaves, green chillies and saute them till the onions turn pink.
      Then, add a pinch of salt and turmeric powder and mix them well.
      Now, take the cubed potatoes and add them to the sauteed onions and mix them together.
      Pour some water into the mixture and allow the potatoes to simmer the mixture for around 4 minutes.
      When the mixture is in semi-thick state, turn off the gas knob and let it rest for a few seconds.</li>
    <li>Now, take a dosa tawa and heat it on low-medium flame.
      Smear a little oil on it to prepare the dosa. When the tawa is hot, pour and spread the batter of urad dal and rice evenly into a circular motion.</li>
    <li>While the colour of dosa's edges turns into brown, reduce the flame and sprinkle few drops of oil on the dosa sides and put 2 tablespoons of filling.
      Fold the dosa. Serve hot Masala Dosa with coconut chutney and sambhar.</li>

    <!--TIPS-->
    <strong>Tips</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>For making that perfect batter for dosa, use short grain or parboiled rice.
          This will make your dosa crispier.</li>
        <li>To attain that golden colour to your dosa, use dry roasted chana dal in your batter.</li>
        <li>For better and quick fermentation, try using 1-2 tbsp of methi seeds in your batter in a warm place.
          This will also make your dosa tastier.</li>
        <li>You might have seen dosa makers sprinkling water on the hot pan and then making the dosa.
          Don’t perform this on the non-stick pan, as it can affect the coating.</li>
        <li>Always use ghee or butter for making your Masala Dosa, this will increase the flavour of your dish.</li>
