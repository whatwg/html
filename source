  <h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>This specification introduces features to HTML and the DOM that
  ease the authoring of Web-based applications. Additions include the
  context menus, a direct-mode graphics canvas, inline popup windows,
  and server-sent events.</p>

  <h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="status">Status of this document</h2>

  <p><strong>This is a work in progress!</strong> This document is
  changing on a daily if not hourly basis in response to comments and
  as a general part of its development process. Comments are very
  welcome, please send them to <a
  href="mailto:whatwg@whatwg.org">whatwg@whatwg.org</a>. Thank
  you.</p>

  <p>Implementors should be aware that this specification is not
  stable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
  discussions are likely to find the specification changing out from
  under them in incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in
  implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the
  call for implementations should join the <a
  href="/mailing-list">WHATWG mailing list</a> and take part in the
  discussions.</p>

  <p>This draft may contain namespaces that use the <code>uuid:</code>
  URI scheme. These are temporary and will be changed before those
  parts of the specification are ready to be implemented in shipping
  products.</p>

  <p>Sections marked <dfn title="TBW">[TBW]</dfn> are placeholders
  for future text. Sections marked <dfn title="WIP">[WIP]</dfn> are
  very early drafts that need much more work. Other sections are first
  drafts that are ready for substantial comments.</p>

  <p>Sections marked <dfn title="SCS">[SCS]</dfn> are sections
  intended to be self-contained (Self Contained Section). Such
  sections are considered logical units that it would make sense to
  implement independent of most of the rest of the specification,
  provided that enough of the infrastructure is already
  implemented.</p>

  <p>It is not expected that any new major sections will be added to
  this specification beyond those already present (though much work
  still remains in the sections that <em>are</em> present).</p>

  <p>This specification is intended to replace (be the new version of)
  what was previously the HTML4, XHTML 1.x, and DOM2 HTML
  specifications.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">Known issues are usually marked like
  this. There are some spec-wide issues that have not yet been
  addressed: first, case-sensitivity is a very poorly handled topic
  right now; second, event handler attributes are glossed over at the
  moment; and third, there's a ghost of a <dfn>DocumentUI</dfn>

  <h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="contents">Table of contents</h2>
  <!--toc-->
  <hr>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML. HTML
  was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing
  scientific documents, although its general design and adaptations
  over the years has enabled it to be used to describe a number of
  other types of documents.</p>

  <p>The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a
  vague subject referred to as Web Applications. This specification
  attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the HTML
  specifications to address issues raised in the past few years.</p>

  <h3>Scope</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level
  markup language and associated semantic-level scripting APIs for
  authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static documents
  to dynamic applications.</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification does not include addressing
  presentation concerns (although default rendering rules for Web
  browsers are included at the end of this specification).</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification does not include documenting
  every HTML or DOM feature supported by Web browsers. Browsers
  support many features that are considered to be very bad for
  accessibility or that are otherwise inappropriate. For example, the
  <code>blink</code> element is clearly presentational and authors
  wishing to cause text to blink should instead use CSS.</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire
  operating system. In particular, hardware configuration software,
  image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
  expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out
  of scope. In terms of applications, this specification is targetted
  specifically at applications that would be expected to be used by
  users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate
  locations, with low CPU requirements. For instance online purchasing
  systems, searching systems, games (especially multiplayer online
  games), public telephone books or address books, communications
  software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion
  software), document editing software, etc.</p>

  <p>For sophisticated cross-platform applications, there already
  exist several proprietary solutions (such as Mozilla's XUL and
  Macromedia's Flash). These solutions are evolving faster than any
  standards process could follow, and the requirements are evolving
  even faster. These systems are also significantly more complicated
  to specify, and are orders of magnitude more difficult to achieve
  interoperability with, than the solutions described in this
  document. Platform-specific solutions for such sophisticated
  applications (for example the MacOS X Core APIs) are even further
  ahead.</p>


  <h3>Structure of this specification</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification is divided into five key parts:</p>

  <dl>


   <dt><a href="#dom">The DOM</a></dt>

   <dd>The DOM, or Document Object Model, provides a base for the rest
   of the specification.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#semantics">The Semantics</a></dt>

   <dd>Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree
   using the DOM. Each element also has a predefined meaning, which is
   explained in this section. User agent requirements for how to
   handle each element are also given, along with rules for authors on
   how to use the element.</p>


   <dt><a href="#processing-models">The Processing Models</a></dt>

   <dd>In addition to the rules for each element, there are rules for
   handling features that cover multiple elements. These are defined
   in the processing models section, so that the whole feature can be
   defined in one place instead of being split across the definitions
   for multiple elements.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#apis">The High-Level APIs</a></dt>

   <dd>Certain extensions to the DOM provide APIs for interacting with
   the user. Four sections, covering <a href="#apis">the browser
   enviroment</a>, <a href="#editing">editing</a>, <a
   href="#multimedia">multimedia</a>, and <a
   href="#comms">communication</a>, define these high-level APIs.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#syntax">The Language Syntax</a></dt>

   <dd>All of these features would be for naught if they couldn't be
   represented in a serialised form and sent to other people, and so
   this section defines the syntax of HTML, along with rules for how
   to parse HTML.</dd>


  </dl>

  <p>There are also a couple of appendices, defining <a
  href="#rendering">rendering rules</a> for Web browsers, and listing
  <a href="#no">areas that are out of scope</a> for this
  specification.</p>


  <h4>How to read this specification</h4>

  <p>This specification should be read like all other specifications.
  First, it should be read cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it
  should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be read by
  picking random sections from the contents list and following all the
  cross-references.</p>


  <h3>Conformance requirements</h3>

  <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
  non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
  Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
  NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
  in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as
  described in RFC2119. For readability,
  these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this
  specification. <a href="#refsRFC2119">[RFC2119]</a></p>
  <!-- XXX but they should be marked up -->

  <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for user
  agents (relevant to implementors) and documents (relevant to
  authors and authoring tool implementors).</p>

  <p class="note">There is no implied relationship between document
  conformance requirements and implementation conformance
  requirements. User agents are not free to handle non-conformant
  documents as they please; the processing model described in this
  specification applies to implementations regardless of the
  conformity of the input documents.</p> <!--XXX quite possible that
  this is stated twice. check for whether this is a dupe. -->

  <p>User agents fall into several (overlapping) categories with
  different conformance requirements.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt id="interactive">Web browsers and other interactive user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Web browsers that support <span>XHTML</span> must process
    elements and attributes from the <span>HTML namespace</span> found
    in <span>XML documents</span> as described in this specification,
    so that users can interact with them, unless the semantics of
    those elements have been overridden by other specifications.</p>

    <p class="example">A conforming XHTML processor would, upon
    finding an XHTML <code>script</code> element in an XML document,
    execute the script contained in that element. However, if the
    element is found within an XSLT transformation sheet (assuming the
    UA also supports XSLT), then the processor would instead treat the
    <code>script</code> element as an opaque element that forms part
    of the transform.</p>

    <p>Web browsers that support <span title="HTML5">HTML</span> must
    process documents labelled as <code>text/html</code> as described
    in this specification, so that users can interact with them.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt id="non-interactive">Non-interactive presentation user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>User agents that process HTML and XHTML documents purely to
    render non-interactive versions of them must comply to the same
    conformance criteria as Web browsers, except that they are exempt
    from requirements regarding user interaction.</p>

    <p class="note">Typical examples of non-interactive presentation
    user agents are printers (static UAs) and overhead displays
    (dynamic UAs). It is expected that most static non-interactive
    presentation user agents will also opt to <a
    href="#non-scripted">lack scripting support</a>.</p>

    <p class="example">A non-interactive but dynamic presentation UA
    would still execute scripts, allowing forms to be dynamically
    submitted, and so forth. However, since the concept of "focus" is
    irrelevant when the user cannot interact with the document, the UA
    would not need to support any of the focus-related DOM APIs.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>User agents with no scripting support</dt>

   <dd id="non-scripted">

    <p>Implementations that do not support scripting (or which have
    their scripting features disabled) are exempt from supporting the
    events and DOM interfaces mentioned in this specification. For the
    parts of this specification that are defined in terms of an events
    model or in terms of the DOM, such user agents must still act as
    if events and the DOM were supported.</p>

    <p class="note">Scripting can form an integral part of an
    application. Web browsers that do not support scripting, or that
    have scripting disabled, might be unable to fully convey the
    author's intent.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Conformance checkers</dt>

   <dd id="conformance-checkers">

    <p>Conformance checkers must verify that a document conforms to
    the applicable conformance criteria described in this
    specification. Conformance checkers are exempt from detecting
    errors that require interpretation of the author's intent (for
    example, while a document is non-conforming if the content of a
    <code>blockquote</code> element is not a quote, conformance
    checkers do not have to check that <code>blockquote</code>
    elements only contain quoted material).</p>

    <p>Conformance checkers must check that the input document
    conforms when scripting is disabled, and should also check that
    the input document conforms when scripting is enabled. (This is
    only a "SHOULD" and not a "MUST" requirement because it has been
    proven to be impossible. <a
    href="#refsHALTINGPROBLEM">[HALTINGPROBLEM]</a>)</p> <!-- XXX
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem but I'd rather
    reference Godel's original paper if someone can find the
    ref... -->

    <div class="note">
     <p>The term "validation" specifically refers to a subset of
     conformance checking that only verifies that a document complies
     with the requirements given by an SGML or XML DTD. Conformance
     checkers that only perform validation are non-conforming, as
     there are many conformance requirements described in this
     specification that cannot be checked by SGML or XML DTDs.</p>
     <p>To put it another way, there are three types of conformance
     criteria:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Criteria that can be expressed in a DTD.</li>
      <li>Criteria that cannot be expressed by a DTD, but can still be
      checked by a machine.</li>
      <li>Criteria that can only be checked by a human.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>A conformance checker must check for the first two. A simple
     DTD-based validator only checks for the first class of errors and
     is therefore not a conforming conformance checker according to
     this specification.</p>
    </div>
   </dd>

   <dt>Data mining tools</dt>

   <dd id="data-mining">

    <p>Applications and tools that process HTML and XHTML documents
    for reasons other than to either render the documents or check
    them for conformance should act in accordance to the semantics of
    the documents that they process.</p>

    <p class="example">A tool that generates <span title="sections and
    headings">document outlines</span> but increases the nesting level
    for each paragraph and does not increase the nesting level for
    each section would not be conforming.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt id="editors">Authoring tools and markup generators</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Authoring tools and markup generators must generate conforming
    documents. Conformance criteria that apply to authors also apply
    to authoring tools, where appropriate.</p>

    <p class="big-issue">This needs expanding (see source).</p>

<!--

I've noted this in the markup for now. I need to take a much closer look
at the conformance requirements for editors; in particular I've been
talking to a number of people who implement HTML editors and their
unanimous feedback is that it is unrealistic to prevent them from
including presentational markup, because the state of the art in UI does
not yet have a way of conveying "semantics" in a comprehensive way.

Thus the conformance criteria for editors will probably be changed to
allow them to include <font> markup while still defining such documents to
be non-conformant HTML5 documents.

Or something. Like I said, this needs thought (feel free to mail ideas
and suggestions on this to the list, btw).

-->


   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on
  elements, attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements fall
  into two categories; those describing content model restrictions,
  and those describing implementation behaviour. The former category
  of requirements are requirements on documents and authoring
  tools. The second category are requirements on user agents.</p>

  <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
  may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
  equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
  specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to
  be performant.)</p>

  <p id="hardwareLimitations">User agents may impose
  implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs,
  e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running
  out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.</p>

  <p>For compatibility with existing content and prior specifications,
  this specification describes two authoring formats: one based on XML
  (referred to as <dfn id="xhtml5" title="XHTML">XHTML5</dfn>), and
  one using a <a href="#parsing">custom format</a> inspired by SGML
  (referred to as <dfn id="html5">HTML5</dfn>). Implementations may
  support only one of these two formats, although supporting both is
  encouraged.</p>

  <p id="authors-using-xhtml"><span>XHTML</span> documents (<span>XML
  documents</span> using elements from the <span>HTML
  namespace</span>) that use the new features described in this
  specification and that are served over the wire (e.g. by HTTP) must
  be sent using an XML MIME type such as <code>application/xml</code>
  or <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> and must not be served as
  <code>text/html</code>. <a href="#refsRFC3023">[RFC3023]</a></p>

  <p>Such XML documents may contain a <code>DOCTYPE</code> if desired,
  but this is not required to conform to this specification.</p>

  <p id="authors-using-html"><span>HTML documents</span> that use the
  new features described in this specification must start with the
  string <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> and, if they are served
  over the wire (e.g. by HTTP) must be labelled with the
  <code>text/html</code> MIME type.</p> <!-- XXX move the DOCTYPE
  requirement to the syntax section -->

  <p id="entity-references">The language in this specification assumes
  that the user agent expands all entity references, and therefore
  does not include entity reference nodes in the DOM. If user agents
  do include entity reference nodes in the DOM, then user agents must
  handle them as if they were fully expanded when implementing this
  specification. For example, if a requirement talks about an
  element's child text nodes, then any text nodes that are children of
  an entity reference that is a child of that element would be used as
  well.</p> <!-- XXX unexpandable entities? -->


  <p class="big-issue">A lot of arrays/lists/<span>collection</span>s
  in this spec assume zero-based indexes but use the term "<var
  title="">index</var>th" liberally. We should define those to be
  zero-based and be clearer about this.</p>
  

  <h4>Dependencies</h4>

  <p>This specification relies on several other underlying
  specifications.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>XML</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Implementations that support XHTML5 must support some version
    of XML, as well as its corresponding namespaces specification,
    because XHTML5 uses an XML serialisation with namespaces. <a
    href="#refsXML">[XML]</a> <a
    href="#refsXMLNAMES">[XMLNAMES]</a></p>

   </dd>

   <dt>XML Base</dt>

   <dd>

    <p id="xmlBase">User agents must follow the rules given by XML
    Base to resolve relative URIs in HTML and XHTML fragments, because
    that is the mechanism used in this specification for resolving
    relative URIs in DOM trees. <a
    href="#refsXMLBASE">[XMLBASE]</a></p>

    <p class="note">It is possible for <code>xml:base</code> attributes
    to be present even in HTML fragments, as such attributes can be
    added dynamically using script.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>DOM</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Implementations must support some version of DOM Core and DOM
    Events, because this specification is defined in terms of the DOM,
    and some of the features are defined as extensions to the DOM Core
    interfaces. <a href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a> <a
    href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

    <p>Implementations must support some version of the Window Object,
    because this specification extends this interface to provide some
    of its features. <a href="#refsWINDOW">[WINDOW]</a></p>

   </dd>

   <dt>ECMAScript</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs
    defined in this specification must implement them in a manner
    consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings for DOM Specifications
    specification, as this specification uses that specification's
    terminology. <a href="#refsEBFD">[EBFD]</a></p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>This specification does not require support of any particular
  network transport protocols, image formats, audio formats, video
  formats, style sheet language, scripting language, or any of the DOM
  and WebAPI specifications beyond those described above. However, the
  language described by this specification is biased towards CSS as
  the styling language, ECMAScript as the scripting language, and HTTP
  as the network protocol, and several features assume that those
  languages and protocols are in use.</p>


  <h4>Features defined in other specifications</h4>

  <p>Some elements are defined in terms of their DOM
  <dfn><code>textContent</code></dfn> attribute. This is an attribute
  defined on the <code>Node</code> interface in DOM3 Core. <a
  href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>

  <p class="big-issue">Should textContent be defined differently for
  dir="" and &lt;bdo>? Should we come up with an alternative to
  textContent that handles those and other things, like alt=""?</p>

  <!-- This section is currently here exclusively so that we crossref
  to textContent. XXX also add event-click, event-change,
  event-DOMActivate, etc, here, and just have the section be a general
  "defined in other specifications" section -->

  <p>The terms <dfn>browsing context</dfn> and <dfn>top-level browsing
  context</dfn> are used as defined in the Window Object
  specification. <a href="#refsWINDOW">[WINDOW]</a></p>


  <h4>Relationship to HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, DOM2 HTML</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification represents a new version of HTML4 and XHTML1,
  along with a new version of the associated DOM2 HTML API. Migration
  from HTML4 or XHTML1 to the format and APIs described in this
  specification should in most cases be straightforward, as care has
  been taken to ensure that backwards-compatibility is retained.</p>
  <!-- XXX refs -->

  <p>This specification will eventually supplant Web Forms 2.0 as
  well. <a href="#refsWF2">[WF2]</a></p>


  <h4>Relationship to XHTML2</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>XHTML2 <a href="#refsXHTML2">[XHTML2]</a> defines a new HTML
  vocabulary with better features for hyperlinks, multimedia content,
  annotating document edits, rich metadata, declarative interactive
  forms, and describing the semantics of human literary works such as
  poems and scientific papers.</p>

  <p>However, it lacks elements to express the semantics of many of
  the non-document types of content often seen on the Web. For
  instance, forum sites, auction sites, search engines, online shops,
  and the like, do not fit the document metaphor well, and are not
  covered by XHTML2.</p>

  <p><em>This</em> specification aims to extend HTML so that it is
  also suitable in these contexts.</p>

  <p>XHTML2 and this specification use different namespaces and
  therefore can both be implemented in the same XML processor.</p>


  <h4>Relationship to XUL, WPF/XAML, and other proprietary UI languages</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification is independent of the various proprietary UI
  languages that various vendors provide.</p> <!-- XXX flesh this out? -->


  <h3>Terminology</h3>

  <p>This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and DOM
  attributes, often in the same context. When it is not clear which is
  being referred to, they are referred to as <dfn>content
  attributes</dfn> for HTML and XML attributes, and <dfn>DOM
  attributes</dfn> for those from the DOM. Similarly, the term
  "properties" is used for both ECMAScript object properties and CSS
  properties. When these are ambiguous they are qualified as object
  properties and CSS properties respectively.</p>

  <p id="html-namespace">To ease migration from HTML to XHTML, UAs
  conforming to this specification will place elements in HTML in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace, at least for
  the purposes of the DOM and CSS. The term "<dfn>elements in the HTML
  namespace</dfn>", or "<dfn>HTML elements</dfn>" for short, when used
  in this specification, thus refers to both HTML and XHTML
  elements.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise stated, all elements defined or mentioned in
  this specification are in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace, and all
  attributes defined or mentioned in this specification have no
  namespace (they are in the per-element partition).</p>

  <p>The term <span>HTML documents</span> is sometimes used in
  contrast with <span>XML documents</span> to mean specifically
  documents that were parsed using an <span>HTML parser</span> (as
  opposed to using an XML parser or created purely through the
  DOM).</p>

  <p>Generally, when the specification states that a feature applies
  to HTML or XHTML, it also includes the other. When a feature
  specifically only applies to one of the two languages, it is called
  out by explicitly stating that it does not apply to the other
  format, as in "for HTML, ... (this does not apply to XHTML)".</p>

  <p>This specification uses the term <em>document</em> to refer to
  any use of HTML, ranging from short static documents to long essays
  or reports with rich multimedia, as well as to fully-fledged
  interactive applications.</p>

  <p>For readability, the term URI is used to refer to both ASCII URIs
  and Unicode IRIs, as those terms are defined by <a
  href="#refsRFC3986">[RFC3986]</a> and <a
  href="#refsRFC3987">[RFC3987]</a> respectively. On the rare
  occasions where IRIs are not allowed but ASCII URIs are, this is
  called out explicitly.</p>

  <p>The term <dfn>root element</dfn>, when not qualified to
  explicitly refer to the document's root element, means the furthest
  ancestor element node of whatever node is being discussed, or the
  node itself is there is none. When the node is a part of the
  document, then that is indeed the document's root element. However,
  if the node is not currently part of the document tree, the root
  element will be an orphaned node.</p>

  <p>An element is said to have been <dfn title="insert an element
  into a document">inserted into a document</dfn> when its <span>root
  element</span> changes and is now the document's <span>root
  element</span>.</p>

  <p>The term <dfn>tree order</dfn> means a pre-order, depth-first
  traversal of DOM nodes involved (through the <code
  title="">parentNode</code>/<code title="">childNodes</code>
  relationship).</p>

  <p>When it is stated that some element or attribute is <dfn
  title="ignore">ignored</dfn>, or treated as some other value, or
  handled as if it was something else, this refers only to the
  processing of the node after it is in the DOM. A user agent must not
  mutate the DOM in such situations.</p>

  <p>When an XML name, such as an attribute or element name, is
  referred to in the form
  <code><var title="">prefix</var>:<var title="">localName</var></code>, as in
  <code>xml:id</code> or <code>svg:rect</code>, it refers to a name
  with the local name <var title="">localName</var> and the namespace given by
  the prefix, as defined by the following table:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><code title="">xml</code></dt>
   <dd><code>http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace</code></dd>
   <dt><code title="">html</code></dt>
   <dd><code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code></dd>
   <dt><code title="">svg</code></dt>
   <dd><code>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code></dd>
  </dl>

  <p>For simplicity, terms such as <em>shown</em>, <em>displayed</em>,
  and <em>visible</em> might sometimes be used when referring to the
  way a document is rendered to the user. These terms are not meant to
  imply a visual medium; they must be considered to apply to other
  media in equivalent ways.</p>

  <p>Various DOM interfaces are defined in this specification using
  pseudo-IDL. This looks like OMG IDL but isn't. For instance, method
  overloading is used, and types from the W3C DOM specifications are
  used without qualification. Language-specific bindings for these
  abstract interface definitions must be derived in the way consistent
  with W3C DOM specifications. Some interface-specific binding
  information for ECMAScript is included in this specification.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">The current situation with IDL blocks is
  pitiful. IDL is totally inadequate to properly represent what
  objects have to look like in JS; IDL can't say if a member is
  enumerable, what the indexing behaviour is, what the stringification
  behaviour is, what behaviour setting a member whose type is a
  particular interface should be (e.g. setting of document.location or
  element.className), what constructor an object implementing an
  interface should claim to have, how overloads work, etc. I think we
  should make the IDL blocks non-normative, and/or replace them with
  something else that is better for JS while still being clear on how
  it applies to other languages.</p>

  <p>The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where
  <code>Foo</code> is actually an interface, is sometimes used instead
  of the more accurate "an object implementing the interface
  <code>Foo</code>".</p>

  <p>A DOM attribute is said to be <em>getting</em> when its value is
  being retrieved (e.g. by author script), and is said to be
  <em>setting</em> when a new value is assigned to it.</p>

  <p>If a DOM object is said to be <dfn>live</dfn>, then that means
  that any attributes returning that object must always return the
  same object (not a new object each time), and the attributes and
  methods on that object must operate on the actual underlying data,
  not a snapshot of the data.</p>

  <p>The terms <em>fire</em> and <em>dispatch</em> are used
  interchangeably in the context of events, as in the DOM Events
  specifications. <a href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>Some of the algorithms in this specification, for historical
  reasons, require the user agent to <dfn>pause</dfn> until some
  condition has been met. While a user agent is paused, it must ensure
  that no scripts execute (e.g. no event handlers, no timers,
  etc). User agents should remain responsive to user input while
  paused, however.</p>


  <h4>HTML vs XHTML</h4>

  <p class="big-issue">We need to explain the difference between XHTML
  and HTML somewhere, probably earlier in the introduction in fact,
  but the problem is I don't know how to explain it. If someone can
  come up with some good text to describe the difference and
  similarities between the two (namely that they are just different
  serialisations of the same in-memory structure, with a few caveats),
  then please send it to the WHATWG list so I can include it. The
  problem is making it accurate while keeping it simple enough that
  people who don't know what a serialisation of an in-memory structure
  is can still get it. (The relevant section doesn't have to be
  normative, if that helps.) The sentence "Every XML and HTML document
  in an HTML UA is represented by a Document object." from section 2.3
  should seem perfectly reasonable after someone has read this
  section.</p>



  <h2 id="dom">The Document Object Model</h2>

  <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation &mdash; a
  model &mdash; of the document and its content. <a
  href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a> The DOM is not just an API; the
  conformance criteria of HTML implementations are defined, in this
  specification, in terms of operations on the DOM.</p>


  <h3>The security model <span title="WIP">[WIP]</span></h3>

<!-- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346659 -->

  <p><em>Web browser vendors should implement this security model, to
  provide Web authors with a consistent development environment that
  is interoperable across different implementations. However,
  implementors may use any other model if desired.</em></p>

  <p>The security model for Web browsers has grown organically with
  the development of the Web, and as such is somewhat unique.</p>

  <p>Access to resources and APIs is granted or denied to Web content
  (scripts, elements, etc) based on the content's
  <dfn>origin</dfn>. For historical reasons, the mechanism for
  determining the <em>origin</em> of a particular piece of content
  depends on the nature of the content.</p>

  <h3>The document</h3>

  <p>Every XML and HTML document in an HTML UA is represented by a
  <code>Document</code> object. <a
  href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>

  <p><code>Document</code> objects are assumed to be <dfn>XML
  documents</dfn> unless they are flagged as being <dfn>HTML
  documents</dfn> when they are created. Whether a document is an
  <span title="HTML documents">HTML document</span> or an <span
  title="XML documents">XML document</span> affects the behaviour of
  certain APIs, as well as a few CSS rendering rules. <a
  href="#refsCSS21">[CSS21]</a></p>

  <p>All <code>Document</code> objects (in user agents implementing
  this specification) must also implement the
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface, available using
  binding-specific methods. (This is the case whether or not the
  document in question is an <span title="HTML documents">HTML
  document</span> or indeed whether it contains any <span>HTML
  elements</span> at all.)</p>

  <p><code>Document</code> objects must also implement the
  document-level interface of any other namespaces found in the
  document that the UA supports. For example, if an HTML
  implementation also supports SVG, then the <code>Document</code>
  object must implement <code>HTMLDocument</code> and
  <code>SVGDocument</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">Because the <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface is
  now obtained using binding-specific casting methods instead of
  simply being the primary interface of the document object, it is no
  longer defined as inheriting from <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">This specification requires that implementations
  also implement some version of the Window object specification, so
  all <code>HTMLDocument</code> objects also implement the
  <code>DocumentWindow</code> object and thus the
  <code>DocumentView</code> object.</p>

  4.3.3. <a href="#refsRFC2109">[RFC2109]</a></p>



  <h3>The elements</h3>

  <p>The nodes representing <span>HTML elements</span> in the DOM must
  implement, and expose to scripts, the interfaces listed for them in
  the relevant sections of this specification. This includes
  <span>XHTML</span> elements in <span>XML documents</span>, even when
  those documents are in another context (e.g. inside an XSLT
  transform).</p>

  <p>The basic interface, from which all the <span>HTML

  elements that have no additional requirements, is the
  <code>HTMLElement</code> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>HTMLElement</dfn> : <span>Element</span> {

  <p>As with the <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface, this interface
  holds methods and attributes related to a number of disparate
  features, and the members of this interface are therefore described
  in various different sections of this specification.</p>


  <h4>Reflecting content attributes in DOM attributes</h4>

  <p>Some <span title="DOM attribute">DOM attributes</span> are
  defined to <dfn>reflect</dfn> a particular <span>content
  attribute</span>. This means that on getting, the DOM attribute
  returns the current value of the content attribute, and on setting,
  the DOM attribute changes the value of the content attribute to the
  given value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a <code>DOMString</code>
  attribute defined to contain a URI, then on getting, the DOM
  attribute must return the value of the content attribute, resolved
  to an absolute URI, and on setting, must set the content attribute
  to the specified literal value. If the content attribute is absent,
  the DOM attribute must return the default value, if the content
  attribute has one, or else the empty string.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a <code>DOMString</code>
  attribute that is not defined to contain a URI, then the getting and
  setting must be done in a transparent, case-sensitive manner, except
  if the content attribute is defined to only allow a specific set of
  values. In this latter case, the attribute's value must first be
  <span>converted to lowercase</span><!--XXX xref --> before being
  returned. If the content attribute is absent, the DOM attribute must
  return the default value, if the content attribute has one, or else
  the empty string.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a boolean attribute, then the
  DOM attribute must return true if the attribute is set, and false if
  it is absent. On setting, the content attribute must be removed if
  the DOM attribute is set to false, and must be set to have the same
  value as its name if the DOM attribute is set to true.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a numeric type
  (<code>long</code>) then the content attribute must be <a
  href="#toNumber">converted to a numeric type</a> first (truncating
  any fractional part). If that fails, or if the attribute is absent,
  the default value must be returned instead, or 0 if there is no
  default value. On setting, the given value must be converted to a
  string representing the number in base ten and then that string must
  be used as the new content attribute value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is of the type
  <code>DOMTokenString</code>, then on getting it must return the
  <code>DOMTokenString</code> object that represents the element's
  correspending content attribute, and on setting, the <em>string
  representation of the new value</em> must replace the value of the
  element's <code title="attr-class">class</code> content attribute,
  adding such an attribute if the element doesn't have one. The setter
  is unusual in that it expects a string, and does not affect the
  <code>DOMTokenString</code> object that is returned on getting. The
  same <code>DOMTokenString</code> object must be returned every
  time. When the attribute is absent, then the string represented by
  the <code>DOMTokenString</code> object is the empty string.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute has the type
  <code>HTMLElement</code>, or an interface that descends from
  <code>HTMLElement</code>, then, on getting, it must run the
  following algorithm (stopping at the first point where a value is
  returned):

  <ol>

   <li>If the corresponding content attribute is absent, then the
   DOM attribute must return null.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">candidate</var> be the element that the <code
   title="">document.getElementById()</code> method would find if it
   was passed as its argument the current value of the corresponding
   content attribute.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">candidate</var> is null, or if it is not
   type-compatible with the DOM attribute, then the DOM attribute must
   return null.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, it must return <var title="">candidate</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>On setting, if the given element has an <code
  title="attr-id">id</code> attribute, then the content attribute must
  be set to the value of that <code title="attr-id">id</code>
  attribute. Otherwise, the DOM attribute must be set to the empty
  string.</p><!-- XXX or raise an exception? -->




  <h3><dfn>DOM tree accessors</dfn></h3>

  document's root element, if there is one and it's an
  <code>html</code> element, or null otherwise.</p>

  <p><dfn>The <code>head</code> element</dfn> of a document is the
  first <code>head</code> element that is a child of <span>the

  <p><dfn>The <code>title</code> element</dfn> of a document is the

  on getting, return a concatenation of the data of all the text node
  children of <span>the <code>title</code> element</span>, or the
  empty string if <span>the <code>title</code> element</span> is
  null.</p>

  <p>On setting, the following algorithm must be run:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If <span>the <code>head</code> element</span> is null, then the
   attribute must do nothing. Stop the algorithm here.</li>

   <li>If <span>the <code>title</code> element</span> is null, then a
   new <code>title</code> element must be created and appended to
   <span>the <code>head</code> element</span>.</li>

   <li>The children of <span>the <code>title</code> element</span> (if
   any) must all be removed.</li>

  <p><dfn>The body element</dfn> of a document is the first child of
  <span>the <code>html</code> element</span> that is either a
  <code>body</code> element or a <code>frameset</code> element. If

  <code>Document</code> object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-body"><code>body</code></dfn>
  attribute, on getting, must return <span>the body element</span> of
  the document (either a <code>body</code> element, a
  <code>frameset</code> element, or null). On setting, the following
  algorithm must be followed:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the new value is not a <code>body</code> or
   <code>frameset</code> element, then raise a
   <code>HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR</code> exception and abort these
   steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the new value is the same as <span>the body
   element</span>, do nothing. Abort these steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if <span>the body element</span> is not null, then
   replace that element with the new value in the DOM, as if the root
   element's <code title="">replaceChild()</code> method had been
   called with the new value and <span title="the body element">the
   incumbent body element</span> as its two arguments respectively,
   then abort these steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, the <span>the body element</span> is null. Append
   the new value to the root element.</li>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-images"><code>images</code></dfn>

  <code>Document</code> node, whose filter matches only
  <code>img</code> elements. (The same instance of the
  <code>HTMLCollection</code> object must be returned each time.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-links"><code>links</code></dfn>
  attribute must return an <code>HTMLCollection</code> rooted at the
  <code>Document</code> node, whose filter matches only <code>a</code>
  elements with <code title="attr-a-href">href</code> attributes and

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-forms"><code>forms</code></dfn>
  attribute must return an <code>HTMLCollection</code> rooted at the
  <code>Document</code> node, whose filter matches only
  <code>form</code> elements. (The same instance of the
  <code>HTMLCollection</code> object must be returned each time.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-anchors"><code>anchors</code></dfn>
  attribute must return an <code>HTMLCollection</code> rooted at the
  <code>Document</code> node, whose filter matches only <code>a</code>
  elements with <code title="attr-a-href">name</code> attributes. (The
  same instance of the <code>HTMLCollection</code> object must be
  returned each time.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-getElementsByName"><code>getElementsByName(<var
  title="">name</var>)</code></dfn> method a string <var
  title="">name</var>, and must return a live <code>NodeList</code>
  containing all the <code>a</code>, <code>applet</code>,
  <code>button</code>, <code>form</code>, <!-- frame? frameset?
  XXX--><code>iframe</code>, <code>img</code>, <code>input</code>,
  <code>map</code>, <code>meta</code>, <code>object</code>,<!-- param?
  XXX--> <code>select</code>, and <code>textarea</code> elements in
  that document that have a <code title="">name</code> attribute whose
  value is equal<!-- XXX case sensitivity --> to the <var
  title="">name</var> argument.</p> <!-- XXX what about XHTML? -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-getElementsByClassName"><code>getElementsByClassName(<var
  title="">classNames</var>)</code></dfn> method takes an array of
  strings representing classes. When called, the method must return a
  live <code>NodeList</code> object containing all the elements in the
  document that have all the classes specified in that array. If the
  array is empty, then the method must return an empty
  <code>NodeList</code>.</p>

  <p>HTML, XHTML, SVG and MathML elements define which classes they
  are in by having an attribute in the per-element partition with the
  name <code title="">class</code> containing a space-separated list
  of classes to which the element belongs. Other specifications may
  also allow elements in their namespaces to be labelled as being in
  specific classes. UAs must not assume that all attributes of the
  name <code>class</code> for elements in any namespace work in this
  way, however, and must not assume that such attributes, when used as
  global attributes, label other elements as being in specific
  classes.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Given the following XHTML fragment:</p>
   <pre>&lt;div id="example"&gt;
 &lt;p id="p1" class="aaa bbb"/&gt;
 &lt;p id="p2" class="aaa ccc"/&gt;
 &lt;p id="p3" class="bbb ccc"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
   <p>A call to
   <code>document.getElementById('example').getElementsByClassName('aaa')</code>
   would return a <code>NodeList</code> with the two paragraphs
   <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> in it.</p>
   <p>A call to <code>getElementsByClassName(['ccc', 'bbb'])</code>
   would only return one node, however, namely <code>p3</code>.  A
   call to
   <code>document.getElementById('example').getElementsByClassName('ccc
   bbb')</code> would return the same thing.</p>
   <p>A call to <code>getElementsByClassName(['aaa bbb'])</code> would
   return no nodes; none of the elements above are in the "aaa bbb"
   class.</p>
   <p>A call to <code>getElementsByClassName([''])</code> would also
   return no nodes, since none of the nodes are in the "" class
   (indeed, in HTML, it is impossible to specify that an element is in
   the "" class).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-getElementsByClassName"><code>getElementsByClassName()</code></dfn>
  method on the <code>HTMLElement</code> interface must return the
  nodes that the <code>HTMLDocument</code> <code
  title="dom-document-getElementsByClassName">getElementsByClassName()</code>
  method would return, excluding any elements that are not descendants
  of the <code>HTMLElement</code> object on which the method was
  invoked.</p>

  <h3>APIs in HTML documents</h3>
  <!-- XXX case-sensitivity training required here. -->

  <p>For <span>HTML documents</span>, and for <span>HTML
  elements</span> in <span>HTML documents</span>, certain APIs become
  case-insensitive or case-changing, as sometimes defined in DOM3
  Core, and as summarised or required below. <a
  href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a>.</p>

  <p>This does not apply to <span>XML documents</span> or to elements
  that are not in the <span>HTML namespace</span> despite being in
  <span>HTML documents</span>.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><code title="">Element.tagName</code>, <code
   title="">Node.nodeName</code>, and <code
   title="">Node.localName</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>These attributes return tag names in all uppercase<!-- XXX
    xref-->, regardless of the case with which they were created.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Document.createElement()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The canonical form of HTML markup is all-lowercase; thus, this
    method will lowercase<!-- XXX xref --> the argument before
    creating the requisite element. Also, the element created must be
    in the <span>HTML namespace</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">This doesn't apply to <code
    title="">Document.createElementNS()</code>. Thus, it is possible,
    by passing this last method a tag name in the wrong case, to
    create an element that claims to have the tag name of an HTML
    element, but doesn't support its interfaces, because it really has
    another tag name not accessible from the DOM APIs.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Element.setAttributeNode()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When an <code>Attr</code> node is set on an <span>HTML
    element</span>, it must have its name lowercased<!-- XXX xref -->
    before the element is affected.</p>

    <p class="note">This doesn't apply to <code
    title="">Document.setAttributeNodeNS()</code>.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Element.setAttribute()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When an attribute is set on an <span>HTML element</span>, the
    name argument must be lowercased<!-- XXX xref --> before the
    element is affected.</p>

    <p class="note">This doesn't apply to <code
    title="">Document.setAttributeNS()</code>.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Document.getElementsByTagName()</code> and <code
   title="">Element.getElementsByTagName()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>These methods (but not their namespaced counterparts) must
    compare the given argument case-insensitively<!-- XXX xref -->
    when looking at <span>HTML elements</span>, and case-sensitively
    otherwise.</p>

    <p class="note">Thus, in an <span>HTML document</span> with nodes
    in multiple namespaces, these methods will be both case-sensitive
    and case-insensitive at the same time.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Document.renameNode()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If the new namespace is the <span>HTML namespace</span>, then
    the new qualified name must be lowercased before the rename takes
    place.<!-- XXX xref --></p>

   </dd>
   

  </dl>




  <h3><dfn>Dynamic markup insertion</dfn></h3>

  <p>The <code title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code>
  family of methods and the <code
  title="dom-innerHTML">innerHTML</code> family of DOM attributes
  enable script authors to dynamically insert markup into the
  document.</p>

  <p>Because these APIs interact with the parser, their behaviour
  varies depending on whether they are used with HTML (and the
  <span>HTML parser</span>) or XHTML (and the <span>XML
  parser</span>). The following table cross-references the various
  versions of these APIs.</p>

  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <td></td>
     <th><dfn title="dom-document-write"><code>document.write()</code></dfn></th>
     <th><dfn title="dom-innerHTML"><code>innerHTML</code></dfn></th>
    </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>In <span>HTML documents</span></th>
     <td><span title="dom-document-write-HTML"><code>document.write()</code> in HTML</span></td>
     <td><span title="dom-innerHTML-HTML"><code>innerHTML</code> in HTML</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>In <span>XML documents</span></th>
     <td><span title="dom-document-write-XML"><code>document.write()</code> in XML</span></td>
     <td><span title="dom-innerHTML-XML"><code>innerHTML</code> in XML</span></td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Regardless of the parsing mode, the <dfn
  title="dom-document-writeln"><code>document.writeln(<var
  title="">s</var>)</code></dfn> method must call the <code
  title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> method with the
  same argument <var title="">s</var>, and then call the <code
  title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> method with, as
  its argument, a string consisting of a single newline character
  (U+000A).</p>


  <h4>Controlling the input stream</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-open"><code>open()</code></dfn>
  method comes in several variants with different numbers of
  arguments.</p>

  <p>When called with two or fewer arguments, the method must act as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">type</var> be the value of the first
   argument, if there is one, or "<code>text/html</code>"
   otherwise.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">replace</var> be true if there is a second
   argument and it has the value "replace"<!-- case-insensitive. XXX
   -->, and false otherwise.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the document has an <span>active parser</span><!-- XXX xref
    --> that isn't a <span>script-created parser</span>, and the
    <span>insertion point</span> associated with that parser's
    <span>input stream</span> is not undefined (that is, it
    <em>does</em> point to somewhere in the input stream), then the
    method does nothing. Abort these steps.</p>

    <p class="note">This basically causes <code
    title="dom-document-open">document.open()</code> to be ignored
    when it's called in an inline script found during the parsing of
    data sent over the network, while still letting it have an effect
    when called asynchronously or on a document that is itself being
    spoon-fed using these APIs.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the document has an <span>active
   parser</span><!--XXX xref-->, then stop that parser, and throw away
   any pending content in the input stream. <span
   class="big-issue">what about if it doesn't, because it's either
   like a text/plain, or Atom, or PDF, or XHTML, or image document, or
   something?</span></p></li>

   <li><p>Remove all child nodes of the document.</p></li>

   <li><p>Create a new <span>HTML parser</span> and associate it with
   the document. This is a <dfn>script-created parser</dfn> (meaning
   that it can be closed by the <code
   title="dom-document-open">document.open()</code> and <code
   title="dom-document-close">document.close()</code> methods, and
   that the tokeniser will wait for an explicit call to <code
   title="dom-document-close">document.close()</code> before emitting
   an end-of-file token).</p></li>

   <li>Mark the document as being an <span title="HTML documents">HTML
   document</span>.</li>

   <!-- text/plain handling --><li><p>If <var title="">type</var> does
   not have the value "<code>text/html</code>"<!-- XXX matched how?
   -->, then act as if the tokeniser had emitted a <code>pre</code>
   element start tag, then set the <span>HTML parser</span>'s
   <span>tokenisation</span> stage's <span>content model flag</span>
   to <em>PLAINTEXT</em>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">replace</var> is false, then: remove all the
   entries in the <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>session
   history</span> after the <span>current entry</span> in its
   <code>DocumentUI</code>'s <code>History</code> object, add a new
   entry whose address is the same as the <span>current entry</span>'s
   at the end of the list, and then advance to that page as if the
   <code title="dom-history-forward">history.forward()</code> method
   had been invoked.</p></li>

   <li><p>Finally, set the <span>insertion point</span> to point at just
   before the end of the <span>input stream</span> (which at this
   point will be empty).</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="big-issue">We shouldn't hard-code <code>text/plain</code>
  there. We should do it some other way, e.g. hand off to the section
  on content-sniffing and handling of incoming data streams, the part
  that defines how this all works when stuff comes over the
  network.</p>

  <!-- XXX Should we support XML/XHTML as a type to that method? -->

  <p>When called with three or more arguments, the <code
  title="dom-document-open">open()</code> method on the
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> object must call the <code
  title="dom-open">open()</code> method on the <code>WindowHTML</code>
  interface of the object returned by the <code
  title="dom-document-defaultView">defaultView</code> attribute of the
  <code>DocumentView</code> interface of the <code>HTMLDocument</code>
  object, with the same arguments as the original call to the <code
  title="dom-document-open">open()</code> method. If the <code
  title="dom-document-defaultView">defaultView</code> attribute of the
  <code>DocumentView</code> interface of the <code>HTMLDocument</code>
  object is null, then the method must raise an
  <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-close"><code>close()</code></dfn>
  method must do nothing if there is no <span>script-created
  parser</span> associated with the document. If there is such a
  parser, then, when the method is called, the user agent must insert
  an <span>explicit "EOF" character</span> at the <span>insertion
  point</span> of the parser's <span>input stream</span>.</p>


  <h4>Dynamic markup insertion in HTML</h4>

  <p>In HTML, the <dfn
  title="dom-document-write-HTML"><code>document.write(<var
  title="">s</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must act as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the <span>insertion point</span> is undefined, the <code
    title="dom-document-open">open()</code> method must be called
    (with no arguments) on the <code title="Document">document</code>
    object. The <span>insertion point</span> will point at just before
    the end of the (empty) <span>input stream</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The string <var title="">s</var> must be inserted into the
    <span>input stream</span><!-- XXX xref --> just before the
    <span>insertion point</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If there is <span title="the script that will execute as soon
    as the parser resumes">a script that will execute as soon as the
    parser resumes</span>, then the method must now return without
    further processing of the <span>input stream</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, the tokeniser must process the characters that were
    inserted, one at a time, processing resulting tokens as they are
    emitted, and stopping when the tokeniser reaches the insertion
    point or when the processing of the tokeniser is aborted by the
    tree construction stage (this can happen if a <code>script</code>
    start tag token is emitted by the tokeniser).

    <p class="note">If the <code
    title="dom-document-write-HTML">document.write()</code> method was
    called from script executing inline (i.e. executing because the
    parser parsed a set of <code>script</code> tags), then this is a
    <a href="#nestedParsing">reentrant invocation of the
    parser</a>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Finally, the method must return.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>In HTML, the <dfn
  title="dom-innerHTML-HTML"><code>innerHTML</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute of all <code>HTMLElement</code> and
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> nodes returns a serialisation of the
  node's children using the <span>HTML syntax</span><!-- XXX xref
  -->. On setting, it replaces the node's children with new nodes that
  result from parsing the given value. The formal definitions
  follow.</p>

  <p>On getting, the <code title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code>
  DOM attribute must return the result of running the following
  algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">s</var> be a string, and initialise it to
   the empty string.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>For each child node <var title="">child</var>, in <span>tree order</span>,
    append the appropriate string from the following list to <var
    title="">s</var>:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

     <dt>If the child node is an <code title="">Element</code></dt>

     <dd>

      <p>Append a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (<code title="">&lt;</code>)
      character, followed by the element's tag name (which is all
      lowercase).</p>

      <p>For each attribute that the element has, append a U+0020
      SPACE character, the attribute's name (which again will be all
      lowercase), a U+003D EQUALS SIGN (<code title="">=</code>)
      character, a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (<code
      title="">&quot;</code>) character, the attribute's value, <span
      title="escaping a string">escaped as described below</span>, and
      a second U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (<code title="">&quot;</code>)
      character.</p>

      <p>While the exact order of attributes is UA-defined, and may
      depend on factors such as the order that the attributes were
      given in the original markup, the sort order must be stable,
      such that consecutive calls to <code
      title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code></code> serialise
      an element's attributes in the same order.</p>

      <p>Append a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (<code title="">&gt;</code>)
      character.</p>

      <p>If the child node is an <code title="">Element</code> with a
      tag name that is one of <code>area</code>, <code>base</code>,
      <code>basefont</code>, <code>bgsound</code>, <code>br</code>,
      <code>col</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>frame</code>,
      <code>hr</code>, <code>img</code>, <code>input</code>,
      <code>link</code>, <code>meta</code>, <code>param</code>,
      <code>spacer</code>, or <code>wbr</code>, then continue on to
      the next child node at this point.</p> <!-- also, i guess:
      image, isindex, and keygen, but we don't list those because we
      don't consider those "elements", more "macros", and thus we
      should never serialise them --> <!-- XXX when we get around to
      it, add event-source -->

      <p>Otherwise, append the value of the <var
      title="">child</var> element's <code
      title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> DOM attribute
      (thus recursing into this algorithm for that element),
      followed by a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (<code
      title="">&lt;</code>) character, a U+002F SOLIDUS (<code
      title="">/</code>) character, the element's tag name again
      (which is again all lowercase), and finally a U+003E
      GREATER-THAN SIGN (<code title="">&gt;</code>) character.</p>

     </dd>


     <dt>If the child node is a <code title="">Text</code> or <code
     title="">CDATASection</code> node</dt>

     <dd>

      <p>If one of the ancestors of the child node is a

      <code>iframe</code>, <code>noembed</code>,
      <code>noframes</code>, or <code>noscript</code> element, then
      append the value of the <var title="">child</var> node's <code
      title="">data</code> DOM attribute literally.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, append the value of the <var title="">child</var>
      node's <code title="">data</code> DOM attribute, <span

     </dd>


     <dt>If the child node is a <code title="">Comment</code></dt>

      LESS-THAN SIGN, U+0021 EXCLAMATION MARK, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS,
      U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS), followed by the value of the <var
      title="">child</var> node's <code title="">data</code> DOM
      attribute, followed by the literal string <code>--&gt;</code>
      (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+003E GREATER-THAN
      SIGN).</p>

     </dd>


     <dt>If the child node is a <code title="">DocumentType</code></dt>

     <dd>

      <p>Append the literal string <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE</code> (U+003C

      title="">name</code> DOM attribute, followed by the literal
      string <code>&gt;</code> (U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN).</p>

     </dd>


    </dl>

    <p>Other nodes types (e.g. <code title="">Attr</code>) cannot
    occur as children of elements. If they do, the <code
    title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> attribute must raise
    an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>The result of the algorithm is the string <var
   title="">s</var>.</p></li>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p><dfn id="escapingString">Escaping a string</dfn> (for the
  purposes of the algorithm above) consists of replacing any
  occurances of the "<code title="">&amp;</code>" character by the
  string "<code title="">&amp;amp;</code>", any occurances of the
  "<code title="">&lt;</code>" character by the string "<code
  title="">&amp;lt;</code>", any occurances of the "<code
  title="">&gt;</code>" character by the string "<code
  title="">&amp;gt;</code>", and any occurances of the "<code
  title="">&quot;</code>" character by the string "<code
  title="">&amp;quot;</code>".</p>

  <p class="note">Entity reference nodes are <a
  href="#entity-references">assumed to be expanded</a> by the user
  agent, and are therefore not covered in the algorithm above.</p>

  <p class="note">If the element's contents are not conformant, it is
  possible that the roundtripping through <code
  title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> will not work. For
  instance, if the element is a <code>textarea</code> element to which
  a <code title="">Comment</code> node has been appended, then
  assigning <code title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> to
  itself will result in the comment being displayed in the text
  field. Similarly, if, as a result of DOM manipulation, the element
  contains a comment that contains the literal string "<code
  title="">--&gt;</code>", then when the result of serialising the
  element is parsed, the comment will be truncated at that point and
  the rest of the comment will be interpreted as markup. Another
  example would be making a <code>script</code> element contain a text
  node with the text string "<code>&lt;/</code>", or even worse,
  "<code>&lt;/script></code>".</p>

  <p>On setting, if the node is a document, the <code
  title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> DOM attribute must run
  the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must remove the children nodes of the
    <code>Document</code> whose <code
    title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> attribute is being
    set.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must create a new <span>HTML parser</span>, in
    its initial state, and associate it with the
    <code>Document</code> node.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must mark the <code>Document</code> object as
    being an <span title="HTML documents">HTML document</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must place into the <span>input stream</span>
    for the <span>HTML parser</span> just created the string being
    assigned into the <code
    title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> attribute.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must start the parser and let it run until it
    has consumed all the characters just inserted into the input
    stream. (The <code>Document</code> node will have been populated
    with elements and a <code title="event-load">load</code> event
    will have fired on <span title="the body element">its body
    element</span>.)</p>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>Otherwise, if the node is an element, then setting the <code
  title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> DOM attribute must cause
  the following algorithm to run instead:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must create a new <code>Document</code> node,
    and mark it as being an <span title="HTML documents">HTML
    document</span>.</p>

    <p>The user agent must create a new <span>HTML parser</span>, and
    associate it with the just created <code>Document</code> node.</p>

    <p class="note">Parts marked <dfn title="innerHTML
    case"><code>innerHTML</code> case</dfn> in algorithms in the
    parser section are parts that only occur if the parser was created
    for the purposes of handling the setting of an element's <code
    title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> attribute. The
    algorithms have been annotated with such markings for
    informational purposes only; such markings have no normative
    weight. If it is possible for a condition described as an
    <span><code>innerHTML</code> case</span> to occur even when the
    parser wasn't created for the purposes of handling an element's
    <code title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> attribute, then
    that is an error in the specification.</p>

  <h4>Dynamic markup insertion in XML</h4>

  <p>In an XML context, the <dfn
  title="dom-document-write-XML"><code>document.write(<var

  <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception.</p>

<!--

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-innerHTML-XML"><code>innerHTML</code></dfn>
  attributes, on the other hand, in an XML context, are usable.</p>

  <p>On getting, the <code title="dom-innerHTML-XML">innerHTML</code>
  DOM attribute on <code>HTMLElement</code>s and
  <code>HTMLDocument</code>s, in an XML context, must return a
  namespace-well-formed XML representation of the element or
  document. User agents may adjust prefixes and namespace declarations
  in the serialisation (and indeed might be forced to do so in some
  cases to obtain namespace-well-formed XML). <a
  href="#refsXML">[XML]</a> <a href="#refsXMLNS">[XMLNS]</a></p>

  <p>On setting, if the node is a document, the <code
  title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> DOM attribute on must run
  the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must remove the children nodes of the
    <code>Document</code> whose <code
    title="dom-innerHTML-XML">innerHTML</code> attribute is being
    set.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must create a new <span>XML parser</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <code title="dom-innerHTML-XML">innerHTML</code>
    attribute is being set on an element, the user agent must
    <span>feed the parser</span> just created the string corresponding
    to the start tag of that element, declaring all the namespace
    prefixes that are in scope on that element in the DOM, as well as
    declaring the default namespace (if any) that is in scope on that
    element in the DOM.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must <span>feed the parser</span> just created
    the string being assigned into the <code
    title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> attribute.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <code title="dom-innerHTML-XML">innerHTML</code>
    attribute is being set on an element, the user agent must
    <span>feed the parser</span> the string corresponding to the end
    tag of that element.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the parser found a well-formedness error, the attribute's
    setter must raise a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception and abort
    these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, the user agent must take the children of the
    document, if the attribute is being set on a <code>Document</code>
    node, or of the document's root element, if the attribute is being
    set on an <code>Element</code> node, and append them to the node
    whose <code title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> attribute
    is being set, preserving their order.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>



  <h3>Events</h3>


  <h4>Event listeners</h4>

  <p id="js-function-listener">In the ECMAScript DOM binding, the
  ECMAScript native <code>Function</code> type must implement the
  <code>EventListener</code> interface such that invoking the
  <code>handleEvent()</code> method of that interface on the object
  from another language binding invokes the function itself, with the
  <code>event</code> argument as its only argument. In the ECMAScript
  binding itself, however, the <code>handleEvent()</code> method of
  the interface is not directly accessible on <code>Function</code>
  objects. Such functions must be called in the global scope. If the
  function returns false, the event's <code>preventDefault()</code>
  method must then invoked. Exception: for historical reasons, for the
  HTML <code>mouseover</code> event, the <code>preventDefault()</code>
  method must be called when the function returns true instead.</p>

  <p id="event-handler-attributes">In HTML, event handler attributes
  (such as <code>onclick</code>) are invoked as if they were functions
  implementing <code>EventListener</code>, with the argument called
  <code>event</code>. Such attributes are added as non-capture event
  listeners of the type given by their name (without the leading
  <code>on</code> prefix). Only attributes actually defined <!--to
  exist--> by specifications implemented by the UA (e.g. this
  specification) are actually registered, however. If, for example, an
  author created an <code>onfoo</code> attribute, it would not be
  fired for <code>foo</code> events.</p>

  <p id="scopeResolution">The scope chain for ECMAScript executed in
  HTML event handler attributes must link from the activation object
  for the handler, to its <code>this</code> parameter (the event
  target), to the element's <code>form</code> element if it is a form
  control, to the document, to the global scope (the object
  implementing the <code>Window</code> interface).</p>

  <p class="note">This definition is compatible with how most browsers
  implemented DOM Level 0, but does not exactly describe IE's
  behaviour. See also ECMA262 Edition 3, sections 10.1.6 and 10.2.3,
  for more details on activation objects. <a
  href="#refsECMA262">[ECMA262]</a></p>


  <h4>Event firing</h4>

  <p>Certain operations and methods are defined as firing events on
  elements. For example, the <code
  title="dom-command-click">click()</code> method on the
  <code>HTMLCommandElement</code> is defined as firing a <code
  title="event-click">click</code> event on the element.  <a
  href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p><dfn title="fire a click event">Firing a <code
  title="event-click">click</code> event</dfn> means that a <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#event-click"><code>click</code></a>
  event in the <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code>
  namespace, which bubbles and is cancelable, and which uses the
  <code>MouseEvent</code> interface, must be dispatched at the given
  element. The event object must have its <code
  title="">screenX</code>, <code title="">screenY</code>, <code
  title="">clientX</code>, <code title="">clientY</code>, and <code
  title="">button</code> attributes set to 0, its <code
  title="">ctrlKey</code>, <code title="">shiftKey</code>, <code
  title="">altKey</code>, and <code title="">metaKey</code> attributes
  set according to the current state of the key input device, if any
  (false for any keys that are not available), its <code
  title="">detail</code> attribute set to 1, and its <code
  title="">relatedTarget</code> attribute set to null. The <code
  title="">getModifierState()</code> method on the object must return
  values appropriately describing the state of the key input device at
  the time the event is created.</p>

  <p><dfn title="fire a change event">Firing a <code
  title="event-change">change</code> event</dfn> means that a <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#event-change"><code>change</code></a>
  event in the <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code>
  namespace, which bubbles but is not cancelable, and which uses the
  <code>Event</code> interface, must be dispatched at the given
  element. The event object must have its <code title="">detail</code>
  attribute set to 0.</p>

  <p><dfn title="fire a contextmenu event">Firing a <code
  title="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event</dfn> means that
  a <code title="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code> namespace, which
  bubbles and is cancelable, and which uses the <code>Event</code>
  interface, must be dispatched at the given element. The event object
  must have its <code title="">detail</code> attribute set to 0.</p>

  <p><dfn title="fire a show event">Firing a <code
  title="event-show">show</code> event</dfn> means that a <code
  title="event-show">show</code> event in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code> namespace, which does
  not bubble but is cancelable, and which uses the <code>Event</code>
  interface, must be dispatched at the given element. The event object
  must have its <code title="">detail</code> attribute set to 0.</p>

  <!-- XXX need to define the dispatching of DOMActivate -->

  <p>The default action of these event is to do nothing unless
  otherwise stated.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">If you dispatch a custom "click" event at an
  element that would normally have default actions, they should get
  triggered. We need to go through the entire spec and make sure that
  any default actions are defined in terms of <em>any</em> event of
  the right type on that element, not those that are dispatched in
  expected ways.</p>


  <h4>Event handling</h4>

  <p class="big-issue">We need a section to define how events all
  work, default actions, etc. For example, how does clicking on a span
  in a link that is in another link actually cause a link to be
  followed? which one? (where should this section be?)</p>


  <h3>Common DOM interfaces</h3>

  <h4>Collections</h4>

  <p>The <code>HTMLCollection</code>,
  <code>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code>, and
  <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code> interfaces represent various
  lists of DOM nodes. Collectively, objects implementing these
  interfaces are called <dfn>collections</dfn>.</p>

  <p>When a <span title="collections">collection</span> is created, a
  filter and a root are associated with the collection.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, when the <code>HTMLCollection</code>
  object for the <code
  title="dom-document-images">document.images</code> attribute is
  created, it is associated with a filter that selects only
  <code>img</code> elements, and rooted at the root of the
  document.</p>

  <p>The <span>collection</span> then <dfn title="representated by the
  collection">represents</dfn> a <span>live</span> view of the subtree
  rooted at the collection's root, containing only nodes that match
  the given filter. The view is linear; the nodes within the
  collection must be sorted in <span>tree order</span>.</p>


  <h5>HTMLCollection</h5>

  <p>The <code>HTMLCollection</code> interface represents a generic
  <span>collection</span> of elements.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>HTMLCollection</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-HTMLCollection-length">length</span>;
  Element <span title="dom-HTMLCollection-item">item</span>(in unsigned long index);
  Element <span title="dom-HTMLCollection-namedItem">namedItem</span>(in DOMString name);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLCollection-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of nodes <span>represented by the
  collection</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-HTMLCollection-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection. If there is no <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection, then the method must
  return null.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLCollection-namedItem"><code>namedItem(<var
  title="">key</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the first node
  in the collection that matches the following requirements:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>It is an <code>a</code>, <code>applet</code>,
   <code>area</code>, <code>form</code>, <code>img</code>, or
   <code>object</code> element with a <code
   title="attr-name">name</code> attribute equal to <var
   title="">key</var>, or,</li>

   <li>It is an HTML element of any kind with an <code
   title="attr-id">id</code> attribute equal to <var
   title="">key</var>. (Non-HTML elements, even if they have IDs, are
   not searched for the purposes of <code
   title="dom-HTMLCollection-namedItem">namedItem()</code>.)</li>

  </ul>

  <p>If no such elements are found, then the method must return
  null.</p>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, objects implementing the
  <code>HTMLCollection</code> interface must support being
  dereferenced using the square bracket notation, such that
  dereferencing with an integer index is equivalent to invoking the
  <code title="dom-HTMLCollection-item">item()</code> method with that
  index, and such that dereferencing with a string index is equivalent
  to invoking the <code
  title="dom-HTMLCollection-namedItem">namedItem()</code> method with
  that index.</p>



  <h5>HTMLFormControlsCollection</h5>

  <p>The <code>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code> interface represents
  a <span>collection</span> of form controls.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>HTMLFormControlsCollection</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-length">length</span>;
  <span>HTMLElement</span> <span title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-item">item</span>(in unsigned long index);
  Object <span title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-namedItem">namedItem</span>(in DOMString name);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of nodes <span>represented by the
  collection</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection. If there is no <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection, then the method must
  return null.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-namedItem"><code>namedItem(<var title="">key</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must act according to the following algorithm:

  <ol>

   <li>If, at the time the method is called, there is exactly one node
   in the collection that has either an <code
   title="attr-id">id</code> attribute or a <code
   title="attr-name">name</code> attribute equal to <var title="">key</var>,
   then return that node and stop the algorithm.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if there are no nodes in the collection that have
   either an <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute or a <code
   title="attr-name">name</code> attribute equal to <var
   title="">key</var>, then return null and stop the algorithm.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, create a <code>NodeList</code> object representing a
   live view of the <code>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code> object,
   further filtered so that the only nodes in the
   <code>NodeList</code> object are those that have either an <code
   title="attr-id">id</code> attribute or a <code
   title="attr-name">name</code> attribute equal to <var
   title="">key</var>. The nodes in the <code>NodeList</code> object
   must be sorted in <span>tree order</span>.</li>

   <li>Return that <code>NodeList</code> object.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, objects implementing the
  <code>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code> interface must support being
  dereferenced using the square bracket notation, such that
  dereferencing with an integer index is equivalent to invoking the
  <code title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-item">item()</code>
  method with that index, and such that dereferencing with a string
  index is equivalent to invoking the <code
  title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-namedItem">namedItem()</code>
  method with that index.</p>

-->


  <h5>HTMLOptionsCollection</h5>

  <p>The <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code> interface represents
  a list of <code>option</code> elements.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>HTMLOptionsCollection</dfn> {
           attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-length">length</span>;
  HTMLOptionElement <span title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-item">item</span>(in unsigned long index);
  Object <span title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-namedItem">namedItem</span>(in DOMString name);
};</pre>

  <p>On getting, the <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of nodes <span>represented by the
  collection</span>.</p>

  <p>On setting, the behaviour depends on whether the new value is
  equal to, greater than, or less than the number of nodes
  <span>represented by the collection</span> at that time. If the
  number is the same, then setting the attribute must do nothing. If
  the new value is greater, then <var title="">n</var> new
  <code>option</code> elements with no attributes and no child nodes
  must be appended to the <code>select</code> element on which the
  <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code> is rooted, where <var
  title="">n</var> is the difference between the two numbers (new
  value minus old value). If the new value is lower, then the last
  <var title="">n</var> nodes in the collection must be removed from
  their parent nodes, where <var title="">n</var> is the difference
  between the two numbers (old value minus new value).</p>

  <p class="note">Setting <code
  title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-length">length</code> never removes
  or adds any <code>optgroup</code> elements, and never adds new
  children to existing <code>optgroup</code> elements (though it can
  remove children from them).</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection. If there is no <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection, then the method must
  return null.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-namedItem"><code>namedItem(<var title="">key</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must act according to the following algorithm:

  <ol>

   <li>If, at the time the method is called, there is exactly one node
   in the collection that has either an <code
   title="attr-id">id</code> attribute or a <code
   title="attr-name">name</code> attribute equal to <var
   title="">key</var>, then return that node and stop the
   algorithm.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if there are no nodes in the collection that have
   either an <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute or a <code
   title="attr-name">name</code> attribute equal to <var
   title="">key</var>, then return null and stop the algorithm.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, create a <code>NodeList</code> object representing a

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, objects implementing the

  <p class="big-issue">We may want to add <code>add()</code> and

  <h4>DOMTokenString</h4>

  <p>The <code>DOMTokenString</code> interface represents a string
  that consists of an <span>unordered set of space-separated
  tokens</span>.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>DOMTokenString</dfn> {
  boolean <span title="dom-tokenstring-has">has</span>(in DOMString token);
  void <span title="dom-tokenstring-add">add</span>(in DOMString token);

};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tokenstring-has"><code>has(<var
  title="">token</var>)</code></dfn> method must run the following
  algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the <var title="">token</var> argument contains any
   spaces<!-- XXX elaborate -->, then raise an
   <code>INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR</code> exception and stop the
   algorithm.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the token indicated by <var title="">token</var>
   is one of the tokens in the object's underlying string then return
   true and stop this algorithm.</p>

   <li>Otherwise, return false.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tokenstring-add"><code>add(<var
  title="">token</var>)</code></dfn> method must run the following
  algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the <var title="">token</var> argument contains any
   spaces<!-- XXX elaborate -->, then raise an
   <code>INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR</code> exception and stop the
   algorithm.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the given <var title="">token</var> is already
   one of the tokens in the <code>DOMTokenString</code> object's
   underlying string then stop the algorithm.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the last character of the
   <code>DOMTokenString</code> object's underlying string is not a
   <span>space character</span><!-- XXX xref -->, then append a U+0020
   SPACE character to the end of that string.</li>

   <li>Append the value of <var title="">token</var> to the end of the
   <code>DOMTokenString</code> object's underlying string.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tokenstring-add"><code>remove(<var
  title="">token</var>)</code></dfn> method must run the following
  algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the <var title="">token</var> argument contains any <span
   title="space character">spaces</span><!-- XXX xref -->, then raise
   an <code>INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR</code> exception and stop the
   algorithm.</li>

   <li>If the token indicated by <var title="">token</var> is not one
   of the tokens in the object's underlying string then stop this
   algorithm.</p>

   <li>Remove the string of characters in the underlying string that
   were matched in the previous step.</li>

   <li>If the removal in the previous step resulted in there being two
   or more adjacent spaces characters in the underlying string at the
   point where the token was removed, then collapse the run of <span
   title="space character">space characters</span> at that point to a
   single U+0020 SPACE character.</li>

   <li>If the two previous steps resulted in one or more <span
   title="space character">space characters</span> at the start or end
   of the underlying string, then remove those characters.</li>

   <li>Return to step 2.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, objects implementing the
  <code>DOMTokenString</code> interface must stringify to the object's
  underlying string representation.</p>


  <h4>DOM feature strings</h4>

  <p>DOM3 Core defines mechanisms for checking for interface support,
  and for obtaining implementations of interfaces, using <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#DOMFeatures">feature
  strings</a>. <a href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>

  <p>A DOM application can use the <dfn
  title="hasFeature"><code>hasFeature(<var title="">feature</var>,
  <var title="">version</var>)</code></dfn> method of the
  <code>DOMImplementation</code> interface with parameter values
  "<code title="">HTML</code>" and "<code>5.0</code>" (respectively)
  to determine whether or not this module is supported by the
  implementation. In addition to the feature string "<code
  title="">HTML</code>", the feature string "<code
  title="">XHTML</code>" (with version string "<code>5.0</code>") can
  be used to check if the implementation supports XHTML. User agents
  should respond with a true value when the <code>hasFeature</code>
  method is queried with these values. Authors are cautioned, however,
  that UAs returning true might not be perfectly compliant, and that
  UAs returning false might well have support for features in this
  specification; in general, therefore, use of this method is
  discouraged.</p>

  <p>The values "<code title="">HTML</code>" and "<code
  title="">XHTML</code>" (both with version "<code>5.0</code>") should
  also be supported in the context of the <code>getFeature()</code>
  and <code>isSupported()</code> methods, as defined by DOM3 Core.</p>

  <p class="note">The interfaces defined in this specification are not
  always supersets of the interfaces defined in DOM2 HTML; some
  features that were formerly deprecated, poorly supported, rarely
  used or considered unnecessary have been removed. Therefore it is
  not guarenteed that an implementation that supports "<code
  title="">HTML</code>" "<code>5.0</code>" also supports "<code
  title="">HTML</code>" "<code>2.0</code>".</p>

  <h3>Global attributes</h3>

  <p>The following attributes are common to all HTML elements:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>Global attributes:</dt>
   <dd><code title="attr-class">class</code></dd>
   <dd><code title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code></dd>
   <dd><code title="attr-contextmenu">contextmenu</code></dd>

   <dd><code title="attr-draggable">draggable</code></dd>
   <dd><code title="attr-id">id</code></dd>
   <dd><code title="attr-lang">lang</code></dd>
   <dd><code title="attr-title">title</code></dd>
  </dl>


  <h4><dfn>Metadata attributes</dfn></h4>

  <p>User agents must support the following common attributes on all
  <span>elements in the HTML namespace</span> (including elements that
  are not defined <!--to exist--> by this specification).</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-id"><code>id</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The element's unique identifier. The value must be unique in
    the document and must <!--match the <code>Name</code> production
    from the XML specification. <a href="#refsXML">[XML]</a> [removed
    because we want square brackets to be allowed for WF2]--> contain
    at least one character.</p>

    <p>If the value is not the empty string, user agents must
    associate the element with the given value (exactly) for the
    purposes of ID matching (e.g. for selectors in CSS or for the
    <code>getElementById()</code> method in the DOM).</p>

    <p>Identifiers are opaque strings. Particular meanings should not
    be derived from the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code>
    attribute.</p>

    <p>When an element has an ID set through multiple methods (for
    example, if it has both <code title="attr-id">id</code> and
    <code>xml:id</code> attributes simultaneously <a
    href="#refsXMLID">[XMLID]</a>), then the element has multiple
    identifiers. User agents must use all of an HTML element's
    identifiers (including those that are in error according to their
    relevant specification) for the purposes of ID matching.</p>

    <p>The <dfn title="dom-id"><code>id</code></dfn> attribute must
    <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-id">id</code> content
    attribute.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-title"><code>title</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Advisory information for the element, such as would be
    appropriate for a tooltip. On a link, this could be the title or a
    description of the target resource; on an image, it could be the
    caption or a description of the image; on a paragraph, it could be
    a footnote or commentary on the text; on a citation, it could be
    further information about the source; and so forth. The value is
    text.</p>

    <p>If this attribute is omitted from an element, then it implies
    that the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute of the
    nearest ancestor with a <code title="attr-title">title</code>
    attribute set is also relevant to this element. Setting the
    attribute overrides this, explicitly stating that the advisory
    information of any ancestors is not relevant to this element.
    Setting the attribute to the empty string indicates that the
    element has no advisory information.</p>

    <p>Some elements, such as <code>link</code> and <code>dfn</code>,
    define additional semantics for the <code
    title="attr-title">title</code> attribute beyond the semantics
    described above.</p>

    <p>The <dfn title="dom-title"><code>title</code></dfn> attribute
    must <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-title">title</code>
    content attribute.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-lang"><code>lang</code></dfn> (HTML only) and
   <dfn><code>xml:lang</code></dfn> (XML only)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The primary language for the element's contents and for any of
    the element's attributes that contain text. The value must be a
    valid RFC 3066 language code, or the empty string. <a
    href="#refsRFC3066">RFC3066</a></p>

    <p>If this attribute is omitted from an element, then it implies
    that the language of this element is the same as the language of
    the parent element. Setting the attribute to the empty string
    indicates that the primary language is unknown.</p>

    <p>The <code title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute only applies
    to <span>HTML documents</span>.  Authors must not use the <code
    title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute in <span>XML
    documents</span>. Authors must instead use the
    <code>xml:lang</code> attribute, defined in XML. <a
    href="#refsXML">[XML]</a></p> <!-- XXX -->

    <p>To determine the language of a node, user agents must look at
    the nearest ancestor element (including the element itself if the
    node is an element) that has a <code title="attr-lang">lang</code>
    or <code>xml:lang</code> attribute set. That specifies the
    language of the node.</p>

    <p>If both the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute and the <code
    title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute are set, user agents must
    use the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute, and the <code
    title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute must be <span
    title="ignore">ignored</span> for the purposes of determining the
    element's language.</p>

    <p>If no explicit language is given for the <span>root
    element</span>, then language information from a higher-level
    protocol (such as HTTP), if any, must be used as the final
    fallback language. In the absence of any language information, the
    default value is unknown (the empty string).</p>

    <p>User agents may use the element's language to determine proper
    processing or rendering (e.g. in the selection of appropriate
    fonts or pronounciations, or for dictionary selection). <!--User
    agents must not use the element's language to determine text
    directionality. (commented out because text directionality is a
    rendering-level concern.)--></p>

    <p>The <dfn title="dom-lang"><code>lang</code></dfn> attribute
    must <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-lang">lang</code>
    content attribute.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-dir"><code>dir</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The element's text directionality. The attribute, if specified,
    must have either the literal value <code>ltr</code> or the literal
    value <code>rtl</code>.</p>

    <p>If the attribute has the literal value <code>ltr</code>, the
    element's directionality is left-to-right. If the attribute has
    the literal value <code>rtl</code>, the element's directionality
    is right-to-left. If the attribute is omitted or has another
    value, then the directionality is unchanged.</p>

    <p>The processing of this attribute depends on the presentation
    layer. For example, CSS 2.1 defines a mapping from this attribute
    to the CSS 'direction' and 'unicode-bidi' properties, and defines
    rendering in terms of those property.</p>

    <p>The <dfn title="dom-dir"><code>dir</code></dfn> attribute must
    <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-dir">dir</code> content
    attribute.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-class"><code>class</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The element's classes. The value must be a list of zero or more
    words (consisting of one or more non-space characters) separated
    by one or more <span title="space character">spaces</span>.</p>
    <!-- XXX doesn't really say how class=" X " is handled -->

    <p>User agents must assign all the given classes to the element,
    for the purposes of class matching (e.g. for selectors in CSS or
    for the <code
    title="dom-document-getElementsByClassName">getElementsByClassName()</code>
    method in the DOM).</p>

    <p>Unless defined by one of the URIs given in the
    <code>profile</code> attribute, classes are opaque strings.
    Particular meanings must not be derived from undefined values in
    the <code title="attr-class">class</code> attribute.</p>

    <p>Authors should bear in mind that using the <code title="attr-class">class</code>
    attribute does not convey any additional meaning to the element
    (unless using classes defined by a <code>profile</code>). There is
    no semantic difference between an element <em>with</em> a class
    attribute and one <em>without</em>. Authors that use classes that
    are not defined in a <code>profile</code> should make sure,
    therefore, that their documents make as much sense once all
    <code title="attr-class">class</code> attributes have been removed as they do with
    the attributes present.</p>

    <p>The <dfn title="dom-className"><code>className</code></dfn>
    attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code

  <h3>Documents and document fragments</h3>

  <h4>Semantics</h4>

  <p>Elements, attributes, and attribute values in HTML are defined
  (by this specification) to have certain meanings (semantics). For
  example, the <code>ol</code> element represents an ordered list, and
  the <code title="lang">lang</code> attribute represents the language
  of the content.</p>

  <p>Authors must only use elements, attributes, and attribute values
  for their appropriate semantic purposes.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, the following document is non-conforming, despite
   being syntactically correct:</p>

   <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-GB"&gt;
 &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Demonstration &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; My favourite animal is the cat. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
     &mdash;&lt;a href="http://example.org/~ernest/"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ernest&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
     in an essay from 1992
    &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

   <p>...because the data placed in the cells is clearly not tabular
   data. A corrected version of this document might be:</p>

   <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-GB"&gt;
 &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Demonstration &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt; My favourite animal is the cat. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &mdash;&lt;a href="http://example.org/~ernest/"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ernest&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
   in an essay from 1992
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

   <p>This next document fragment, intended to represent the heading
   of a corporate site, is similarly non-conforming because the second
   line is not intended to be a heading of a subsection, but merely a
   subheading or subtitle (a subordinate heading for the same
   section).</p>

   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;ABC Company&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;Leading the way in widget design since 1432&lt;/h2&gt;
 ...</pre>

   <p>The <code>header</code> element should be used in these kinds of
   situations:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;header&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;ABC Company&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Leading the way in widget design since 1432&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;/header&gt;
 ...</pre>

  </div>

  <p>Through scripting and using other mechanisms, the values of
  attributes, text, and indeed the entire structure of the document
  may change dynamically while a user agent is processing it. The
  semantics of a document at an instant in time are those represented
  by the state of the document at that instant in time, and the
  semantics of a document can therefore change over time. User agents
  must update their presentation of the document as this occurs.</p>

  <p class="example">HTML has a <code>progress</code> element that
  describes a progress bar. If its "value" attribute is dynamically
  updated by a script, the UA would update the rendering to show the
  progress changing.</p>

  <h4>Structure</h4>

  <p>All the elements in this specification have a defined content
  model, which describes what nodes are allowed inside the elements,
  and thus what the structure of an HTML document or fragment must
  look like. Authors must only put elements inside an element if that
  element allows them to be there according to its content model.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of determining if an element matches its content
  model or not, CDATA nodes in the DOM must be treated as text nodes,
  and character <a href="entity-references">entity reference nodes are
  treated as if they were expanded in place</a>.</p>

  <p>The whitespace characters U+0020 SPACE, U+000A LINE FEED, and
  U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN are always allowed between elements. User
  agents must always represent these characters between elements in
  the source markup as text nodes in the DOM. Empty text nodes and
  text nodes consisting of just sequences of those characters are
  considered <dfn>inter-element whitespace</dfn> and must be ignored
  when establishing whether an element matches its content model or
  not.</p>

  <!-- XXX need to define how to handle U+000A LINE FEED and U+000D
  CARRIAGE RETURN in attributes (for HTML) -->

  <p>Authors must only use <span>elements in the HTML namespace</span>
  in the contexts where they are allowed, as defined for each
  element. For XML compound documents, these contexts could be inside
  elements from other namespaces, if those elements are defined as
  providing the relevant contexts.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The SVG specification defines the SVG <code>foreignObject</code>
   element as allowing foreign namespaces to be included, thus
   allowing compound documents to be created by inserting subdocument
   content under that element. <em>This</em> specification defines the
   XHTML <code>html</code> element as being allowed where subdocument
   fragments are allowed in a compound document. Together, these two
   definitions mean that placing an XHTML <code>html</code> element as
   a child of an SVG <code>foreignObject</code> element is
   conforming.</p>
  </div>


  <h4>Kinds of elements</h4>

  <p>Each element in HTML falls into zero or more categories that
  group elements with similar characteristics together. This
  specification uses the following categories:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li><span>Metadata elements</span></li>
   <li><span>Sectioning elements</span></li>
   <li><span>Block-level elements</span></li>
   <li><span>Strictly inline-level content</span></li>
   <li><span>Structured inline-level elements</span></li>
   <li><span>Interactive elements</span></li>
   <li><span>Form control elements</span></li>
  </ul>

  <!-- XXX check that all the above got a section defining them,
  however briefly -->

  <!-- XXX check that the element definitions also link to those
  sections -->

  <p>Some elements have unique requirements and do not fit into any
  particular category.</p> <!-- no category -->


  <h5><dfn>Block-level elements</dfn></h5>

  <p>Block-level elements are used for structural grouping of page
  content.</p>

  <p>There are several kinds of block-level elements:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Some can only contain other block-level elements:
   <code>blockquote</code>, <code>section</code>,
   <code>article</code>, <code>header</code>.</li>

   <li>Some can only contain <span>inline-level content</span>:
   <code>p</code>, <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code>,
   <code>address</code>.</li>

   <li>Some can contain either block-level elements or
   <span>inline-level content</span> (but not both):
   <code>nav</code>, <code>aside</code>, <code>footer</code>,
   <code>div</code>.</li>

   <li>Finally, some have very specific content models:
   <code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>dl</code>,
   <code>table</code>, <code>script</code>.

   </li>

  </ul>

  <p>There are also elements that seem to be block-level but aren't,
  such as <code>body</code>, <code>li</code>, <code>dt</code>,
  <code>dd</code>, and <code>td</code>. These elements are allowed
  only in specific places, not simply anywhere that block-level
  elements are allowed.</p>

  <p>Some block-level elements play multiple roles. For instance, the
  <code>script</code> elements is allowed inside <code>head</code>
  elements and can also be used as <span>inline-level content</span>.
  Similarly, the <code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>dl</code>,
  <code>table</code>, and <code>blockquote</code> elements play dual
  roles as both block-level and inline-level elements.</p>


  <h5><dfn>Inline-level content</dfn></h5>

  <p>Inline-level content consists of text and various elements to
  annotate the text, as well as some <span>embedded content</span>
  (such as images or sound clips).</p>

  <p>Inline-level content comes in various types:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn>Strictly inline-level content</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Text, embedded content, and elements that annotate the text
   without introducing structural grouping. For example:
   <code>a</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>noscript</code>. Elements
   used in contexts allowing only strictly inline-level content must
   not contain anything other than strictly inline-level content.</dd>

   <dt><dfn>Structured inline-level elements</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Block-level elements that can also be used as inline-level
   content. For example: <code>ol</code>, <code>blockquote</code>,
   <code>table</code>.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Unless an element's content model explicitly states that it must
  contain <span>significant inline content</span>, simply having no
  text nodes and no elements satisfies an element whose content model
  is some kind of inline content.</p>

  <p>Some elements are defined to have as a content model
  <dfn>significant inline content</dfn>. This means that at least one
  descendant of the element must be <span>significant text</span> or
  <span>embedded content</span>.</p> <!-- XXX links -->

  <p><dfn>Significant text</dfn>, for the purposes of determining the
  presence of <span>significant inline content</span>, consists of any
  character other than those falling in the <a
  href="http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UCD.html#General_Category_Values">Unicode
  categories</a> Zs, Zl, Zp, Cc, and Cf. <a
  href="#refsUNICODE">[UNICODE]</a></p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following three paragraphs are non-conforming because their
   content model is not satisfied (they all count as empty).</p>
   <pre>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#x00A0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
  </div>


  <h5><dfn>Determining if a particular element contains block-level
  elements or inline-level content</dfn></h5>

  <p>Some elements are defined to have content models that allow
  either <span>block-level elements</span> or <span>inline-level
  content</span>, but not both. For example, the <code>aside</code>
  and <code>li</code> elements.</p>

  <p>To establish whether such an element is being used as a
  block-level container or as an inline-level container, for example
  in order to determine if a document conforms to these requirements,
  user agents must look at the element's child nodes. If any of the
  child nodes are not allowed in block-level contexts, then the
  element is being used for <span>inline-level content</span>. If all
  the child nodes are allowed in a block-level context, then the
  element is being used for <span>block-level elements</span>.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For instance, in the following (non-conforming) fragment, the
   <code>li</code> element is being used as an inline-level element
   container, because the <code>style</code> element is not allowed in
   a block-level context. (It doesn't matter, for the purposes of
   determining whether it is an inline-level or block-level context,
   that the <code>style</code> element is not allowed in inline-level
   contexts either.)</p>
   <pre>&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Hello World &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
   /* This example is illegal. */
  &lt;/style&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</pre>
   <p>In the following fragment, the <code>aside</code> element is
   being used as a block-level container, because even though all the
   elements it contains could be considered inline-level elements,
   there are no nodes that can only be considered inline-level.</p>
   <pre>&lt;aside&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;</pre>
   <p>On the other hand, in the following similar fragment, the
   <code>aside</code> element is an inline-level container, because
   the text ("Foo") can only be considered inline-level.</p>
   <pre>&lt;aside&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 Foo
&lt;/aside&gt;</pre>
  </div>

  <h5><dfn>Interactive elements</dfn></h5>

  <p>Certain elements in HTML can be activated, for instance
  <code>a</code> elements, <code>button</code> elements, or
  <code>input</code> elements when their <code>type</code> attribute
  is set to <code>radio</code>. Activation of those elements can
  happen in various (UA-defined) ways, for instance via the mouse or
  keyboard.</p>

  <p>When activation is performed via some method other than clicking
  the pointing device, the default action of the event that triggers
  the activation must, instead of being activating the element
  directly, be to <span>fire a <code title="">click</code> event</span>
  on the same element.</p>

  <p>The default action of this <code title="event-click">click</code>
  event, or of the real <code title="event-click">click</code> event
  if the element was activated by clicking a pointing device, must be
  to dispatch yet another event, namely <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#event-DOMActivate"><code>DOMActivate</code></a>.
  It is the default action of <em>that</em> event that then performs
  the actual action.</p> <!-- XXX need to define the dispatching of
  DOMActivate in the same way we define the dispatching of click -->

  <p>For certain form controls, this process is complicated further by
  <a
  href="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#the-click">changes
  that must happen around the click event</a>. <a
  href="#refsWF2">[WF2]</a></p> <!-- XXX WF2: when this is merged into
  this spec, update xrefs -->

  <p class="note">Most interactive elements have content models that
  disallowed nesting interactive elements.</p>

  <p class="big-issue"> Need to define how default actions actually
  work. For instance, if you click an event inside a link, the event
  is triggered on that element, but then we'd like a click is sent on
  the link itself. So how does that happen? Does the link have a
  bubbling listener that triggers that second click event? what if
  there are multiple nested links, which one should we send that event
  to?</p>

<!--XXX
Steven Pemberton was as always, a remarkable speaker, but his answer
to my question leaves me a very bad taste. Basically, I asked him why
XHTML2 preserves the useless head and body element. The answer was in
substance "because this is a compromise". Ah. So XHTML2 preserves two
useless elements that add potential dangers to the interpretation and
styling of documents because it's a compromise. Getting rid of head
would allow to attach directly the document's metadata to the root
element of the document, making much more sense than a head element.
Having a head element also preserves the ridiculous
engraved-in-the-marble "head contents are not rendered". Body is
dangerous because it's another box between the document and the
contents; you all have written a blog template with a <div
class="main"> or <div class="content">. Why do we also need a body?

  <p>The <code>html</code> element represents the root of an HTML
  document.</p>


  <h3>Document metadata</h3>

  <p>Document metadata is represented by <dfn>metadata elements</dfn>
  in the document's <code>head</code> element.</p>

  <h4>The <dfn><code>head</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <!-- no category -->

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>
   <dd>As the first element in an <code>html</code> element.</dd>
   <dt>Content model:</dt>
   <dd>In any order, exactly one <code>title</code> element,
   optionally one <code>base</code> element (HTML only), and zero or

           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-profile">profile</span>;
};</pre>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>head</code> element collects the document's
  metadata.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>profile</code></dfn> attribute must, if specified,
  contain a list of zero or more URIs (or IRIs) representing
  definitions of classes, metadata names, and link relations. These
  URIs are opaque strings, like namespaces; user agents are not
  expected to determine any useful information from the resources that
  they reference.</p>

  <p>Each time a class, metadata, or link relationship name that is
  not defined by this specification is found in a document, the UA
  must check whether any of the URIs in the <code>profile</code>
  attribute are known (to the UA) to define that name. The class,
  metadata, or link relationship shall then be interpreted using the
  semantics given by the first URI that is known to define the name.
  If the name is not defined by this specification and none of the
  specified URIs defines the name either, then the class, metadata, or
  link relationship is meaningless and the UA must not assign special
  meaning to that name.</p>

  <p>If two profiles define the same name, then the semantic is given
  by the first URI specified in the <code>profile</code> attribute.
  There is no way to use the names from both profiles in one
  document.</p>

  <p>User agents must ignore all the URIs given in the
  <code>profile</code> attribute that follow a URI that the UA does
  not recognise. (Otherwise, if a name is defined in two profiles, UAs
  would assign meanings to the document differently based on which
  profiles they supported.)</p>

  <p class="note">If a profile's definition introduces new definitions
  over time, documents that use multiple profiles can change defined
  meaning over time. So as to avoid this problem, authors are
  encouraged to avoid using multiple profiles.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-profile"><code>profile</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code>profile</code> content
  attribute on getting and setting.</p>


  <h4>The <dfn><code>title</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <p><span title="metadata elements">Metadata element</span>.</p>

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>

   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>No difference from <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>title</code> element represents the document's title or
  name. Authors should use titles that identify their documents even
  when they are used out of context, for example in a user's history
  or bookmarks, or in search results. The document's title is often
  different from its first header, since the first header does not
  have to stand alone when taken out of context.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here are some examples of appropriate titles, contrasted with
   the top-level headers that might be used on those same pages.</p>

   <pre>  &lt;title>Introduction to The Mating Rituals of Bees&lt;/title>
    ...
  &lt;h1>Introduction&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>This companion guide to the highly successful
  &lt;cite>Introduction to Medieval Bee-Keeping&lt;/cite> book is...
</pre>

   <p>The next page might be a part of the same site. Note how the
   title describes the subject matter unambiguously, while the first
   header assumes the reader knowns what the context is and therefore
   won't wonder if the dances are Salsa or Waltz:</p>

   <pre>  &lt;title>Dances used during bee mating rituals&lt;/title>
    ...
  &lt;h1>The Dances&lt;/h1></pre>

  </div>

  <p>In HTML (as opposed to XHTML), the <code>title</code> element
  must not contain content other than text and entities; user agents
  parse the element so that entities are recognised and
  processed, but all other markup is interpreted as literal text.</p>
  <!-- XXX ensure that this is indeed defined in the parsing section -->

  <p>In XHTML, the <code>title</code> element must not contain any
  elements.</p>

  <p>User agents must concatenate the contents of all the text nodes
  and CDATA nodes that are direct children of the <code>title</code>
  element (ignoring any other nodes such as comments or elements), in
  <span>tree order</span>, to get the string to use as the document's title. User
  agents should use the document's title when referring to the
  document in their user interface.</p>

  <p><span title="metadata elements">Metadata element</span>.</p>

  <dl class="element">

  <p>The <code>base</code> element allows authors to specify the
  document's base URI for the purposes of resolving relative URIs.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-base-href"><code>href</code></dfn> content
  attribute, if specified, must contain a URI (or IRI).</p>

  <p>User agents must use the value of the <code
  title="att-base-href">href</code> attribute on the first
  <code>base</code> element in the document as the document entity's
  base URI for the purposes of section 5.1.1 of RFC 2396
  ("Establishing a Base URI": "Base URI within Document Content"). <a
  href="#refsRFC2396">[RFC2396]</a> Note that this base URI from RFC
  2396 is referred to by the algorithm given in XML Base, which <a
  href="#xmlBase">is a normative part of this specification</a>.</p>

  <p>If the base URI given by this attribute is a relative URI, it
  must be resolved relative to the higher-level base URIs (i.e. the
  base URI from the encapsulating entity or the URI used to retrieve
  the entity) to obtain an absolute base URI.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-base-href">href</code> content attribute
  must be reflected by the DOM <dfn
  title="dom-base-href"><code>href</code></dfn> attribute.</p>

   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>link</code> element allows authors to indicate explicit
  relationships between their document and other resources.</p>

  <p>The destination of the link is given by the <dfn
  title="attr-link-href"><code>href</code></dfn> attribute, which must
  be a URI (or IRI). If the <code title="attr-link-href">href</code>
  attribute is absent, then the element does not define a link.</p>

  <p>The type of link indicated (the relationship) is given by the
  value of the <dfn title="attr-link-rel"><code>rel</code></dfn>
  attribute. The <a href="#linkTypes">allowed values and their
  meanings</a> are defined in a later section. If the <code
  title="attr-link-rel">rel</code> attribute is absent, or if the
  value used is not allowed according to the definitions in this
  specification, then the element does not define a link.</p>

  <p>Two categories of links can be created using the
  <code>link</code> element. <dfn title="external resource link">Links
  to external resources</dfn> are links to resources that are to be
  used to augment the current document, and <dfn title="hyperlink
  link">hyperlinks</dfn> are links to other documents. The <a
  href="#linkTypes">link types section</a> defines whether a
  particular link type is an external resource or a hyperlink. One
  element can create multiple links (of which some might be external
  resource links and some might be hyperlinks). User agents should
  process the links on a per-link basis, not a per-element basis.</p>

  <p>The exact behaviour for links to external resources depends on
  the exact relationship, as defined for the relevant link type. Some
  of the attributes control whether or not the external resource is to
  be applied (as defined below). For external resources that are
  represented in the DOM (for example, style sheets), the DOM
  representation must be made available even if the resource is not
  applied. (However, user agents may opt to only fetch such resources
  when they are needed, instead of pro-actively downloading all the
  external resources that are not applied.)</p>

  <p>Interactive user agents should provide users with a means to
  <span title="following hyperlinks">follow the hyperlinks</span> <!-- XXX check crossref -->
  created using the <code>link</code> element, somewhere within their
  user interface. The exact interface is not defined by this
  specification, but it should include the following information
  (obtained from the element's attributes, again as defined below), in
  some form or another (possibly simplified), for each hyperlink
  created with each <code>link</code> element in the document:</p>

  <ul> <!-- the order here is the order that makes most sense for a UI -->

   <li>The relationship between this document and the resource (given
   by the <code title="attr-link-rel">rel</code> attribute)</li>

   <li>The title of the resource (given by the <code
   title="attr-link-title">title</code> attribute).</li>

   <li>The URI of the resource (given by the <code
   title="attr-link-href">href</code> attribute).</li>

   <li>The language of the resource (given by the <code
   title="attr-link-hreflang">hreflang</code> attribute).</li>

   <li>The optimum media for the resource (given by the <code
   title="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute).</li>

  </ul>

  <p>User agents may also include other information, such as the type
  of the resource (as given by the <code
  title="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute).</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-media"><code>media</code></dfn>
  attribute says which media the resource applies to. The value must
  be a valid media query. <a href="#refsMQ">[MQ]</a></p>

  <p>If the link is a <span title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>
  then the <code title="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute is
  purely advisory, and describes for which media the document in
  question was designed.</p>

  <p>However, if the link is an <span>external resource link</span>,
  then the <code title="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute is
  prescriptive. The user agent must only apply the external resource
  to <a href="#views">views</a> while their state match the listed
  media.</p>

  <p id="default-media">The default, if the <code
  title="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute is omitted, is
  <code>all</code>, meaning that by default links apply to all
  media.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-hreflang"><code>hreflang</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the language of the linked resource. It is purely
  advisory. The value must be a valid RFC 3066 language code. <a
  href="#refsRFC3066">RFC3066</a> User agents must not consider this
  attribute authoritative &mdash; upon fetching the resource, user
  agents must only use language information associated with the
  resource to determine its language, not metadata included in the
  link to the resource.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-type"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute
  gives the MIME type of the linked resource. It is purely advisory.
  The value must be a valid MIME type, optionally with parameters. <a
  href="#refsRFC2046">[RFC2046]</a></p>

  <p>For <span title="external resource link">external resource
  links</span>, user agents may use the type given in this attribute
  to decide whether or not to consider using the resource at all. If
  the UA does not support the given MIME type for the given link
  relationship, then the UA may opt not to download and apply the
  resource.</p>

  <p>User agents must not consider the <code
  title="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute authoritative &mdash;
  upon fetching the resource, user agents must only use the
  Content-Type information associated with the resource to determine
  its type, not metadata included in the link to the resource.</p>

  <p>If the attribute is omitted, then the UA must fetch the resource
  to determine its type and thus determine if it supports (and can
  apply) that external resource.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>If a document contains three style sheet links labelled as
   follows:</p>

   <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="A" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="B" type="text/plain"&gt;

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-title"><code>title</code></dfn>

  <p class="note">The <code title="attr-link-title">title</code>
  attribute on <code>link</code> elements differs from the global
  <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute of most other
  elements in that a link without a title does not inherit the title
  of the parent element: it merely has no title.</p>

  <p>Some versions of HTTP defined a <code title="">Link:</code>
  header, to be processed like a series of <code>link</code> elements.
  When processing links, those must be taken into consideration as
  well. For the purposes of ordering, links defined by HTTP headers
  must be assumed to come before any links in the document, in the
  order that they were given in the HTTP entity header. Relative URIs
  in these headers must be resolved according to the rules given in
  HTTP, not relative to base URIs set by the document (e.g. using a
  <code>base</code> element or <code>xml:base</code> attributes). <a

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>meta</code> element allows authors to specify document
  metadata that cannot be expressed using the <code>title</code>,
  <code>base</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>style</code>, and
  <code>script</code> elements. The metadata is expressed in terms of
  name/value pairs: the <dfn
  title="attr-meta-name"><code>name</code></dfn> attribute on the
  <code>meta</code> element gives the name, and the <dfn
  title="attr-meta-content"><code>content</code></dfn> attribute on
  the same element gives the value.</p>

  <p>To set metadata with <code>meta</code> elements, authors must
  first specify a profile that defines metadata names, using the
  <code>profile</code> attribute. The value of the <code
  title="attr-meta-name">name</code> attribute must be defined by one
  of the profiles, and the value of the <code
  title="attr-meta-content">content</code> attribute must conform to
  the syntax given by the profile.</p>

  <p>How user agents handle metadata set in this way depends on the
  definitions of the profiles involved.</p>

  <p>If a <code>meta</code> element has no <code
  title="attr-meta-name">name</code> attribute, it does not set
  document metadata. If a <code>meta</code> element has no <code
  title="attr-meta-content">content</code> attribute, then the value
  part of the metadata name/value pair is the empty string.</p>

  <p>The DOM attributes <dfn
  title="dom-meta-name"><code>name</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="dom-meta-content"><code>content</code></dfn>
  <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the same

  <h5 id="charset">Specifying and establishing the document's
  character encoding</h5>

  <p>The <code>meta</code> element may also be used, in HTML only (not
  in XHTML) to provide UAs with character encoding information for the
  file. To do this, the <code>meta</code> element must be the first
  element in the <code>head</code> element, it must have the <dfn
  title="attr-meta-http-equiv"><code>http-equiv</code></dfn> attribute
  set to the literal value <code>Content-Type</code>, and must have
  the <code title="attr-meta-content">content</code> attribute set to
  the literal value <code>text/html; charset=</code> immediately
  followed by the character encoding, which must be a valid character
  encoding name. <a href="#refsIANACHARSET">[IANACHARSET]</a> <!-- XXX
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets --> When the
  <code>meta</code> element is used in this way, there must be no
  other attributes set on the element, and the <code>http-equiv</code>
  attribute must be listed first in the source. Other than for giving
  the document's character encoding in this way, the <code
  title="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code> attribute must not be
  used.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">We should allow those strings to be
  case-insensitive, and for zero-or-more spaces where we currently
  require just one.</p>


  <p>In XHTML, the XML declaration should be used for inline character
  encoding information, if necessary.</p>

  <p>Authors should avoid including inline character encoding
  information. Character encoding information should instead be
  included at the transport level (e.g. using the HTTP
  <code>Content-Type</code> header).</p> <!-- XXX should we remove

  <!-- XXX this is the second time we have this paragraph here... -->

  of the parent element: it merely has no title.</p>

  <p>All descendant elements must be processed, according to their
  semantics, before the <code>style</code> element itself is

  agents must evaluate <code>style</code> elements by passing the
  concatenation of the contents of all the text nodes and CDATA nodes
  that are direct children of the <code>style</code> element (not any
  other nodes such as comments or elements), in <span>tree order</span>, to the

  <h3>Sections</h3>

  <p><dfn>Sectioning elements</dfn> are elements that divide the page
  into, for lack of a better word, sections. This section describes
  HTML's sectioning elements and elements that support them.</p>

  <p id="applyToSection">Some elements are scoped to their nearest
  ancestor sectioning element. For example, <code>address</code>
  elements apply just to their section. For such elements <var
  title="">x</var>, the elements that apply to a sectioning element
  <var title="">e</var> are all the <var title="">x</var> elements
  whose nearest sectioning element is <var title="">e</var>.</p>

  <p>The processing of <span>headings and sections</span> is defined

  <p>The <code>body</code> element potentially has a heading. See the
  section on <span>headings and sections</span> for further

  <p>In conforming documents, there is only one <code>body</code>
  element. The <code title="dom-document-body">document.body</code>

  <p>The <code>section</code> element represents a generic document or

  grouping of content, typically with a header, possibly with a
  footer.</p>

  <p class="example">Examples of sections would be chapters, the
  various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered
  sections of a thesis. A Web site's home page could be split into

  <p>The <code>article</code> element represents a section of a page
  that consists of a composition that forms an independent part of a
  document, page, or site. This could be a forum post, a magazine or
  newspaper article, a Web log entry, a user-submitted comment, or any
  other independent item of content.</p>

  <p class="note">An <code>article</code> element is "independent" in
  that its contents could stand alone, for example in syndication.
  However, the element is still associated with its ancestors; for
  instance, contact information that <a href="#applyTo">applies</a> to
  a parent <code>body</code> element still covers the
  <code>article</code> as well.</p>

  <p>When <code>article</code> elements are nested, the inner
  <code>article</code> elements represent articles that are in
  principle related to the contents of the outer article. For
  instance, a Web log entry on a site that accepts user-submitted
  comments could represent the comments as <code>article</code>
  elements nested within the <code>article</code> element for the Web
  log entry.</p>

  <p>Author information associated with an <code>article</code>
  element (q.v. the <code>address</code> element) does not apply to

  <p>The section on <span>headings and sections</span>
  defines how <code>header</code> elements are assigned to individual
  sections.</p>

  <p>The <span>rank</span> of a <code>header</code> element is the
  same as for an <code>h1</code> element (the highest rank).</p>

  <h4>The <dfn><code>footer</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <p><span title="block-level elements">Block-level
  element</span>.</p>

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>
   <dd>Where <span>block-level elements</span> are expected.</dd>
   <dt>Content model:</dt>
   <dd>Either zero or more <span>block-level elements</span>, but with
   no <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>,
   <code>h4</code>, <code>h5</code>, <code>h6</code>,
   <code>header</code>, or <code>footer</code> elements as
   descendants, and with no <span title="sectioning

   <dt>Element-specific attributes:</dt>
   <dd>None.</dd>
   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>No difference from <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>footer</code> element represents the footer for the
  section it <a href="#applyToSection">applies</a> to. A footer
  typically contains information about its section such as who wrote
  it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like.</p>

  <p><code>footer</code> elements must not contain any
  <code>footer</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>h1</code>,
  <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, <code>h4</code>, <code>h5</code>,
  or <code>h6</code> elements, or any of the sectioning elements (such
  as <code>section</code>), as descendants.</p>

  <p>When <span title="Determining if a particular element contains
  block-level elements or inline-level content">used as an
  inline-level content</span> container, the element represents a
  <span>paragraph</span>.</p>

  <p>Contact information for the section given in a
  <code>footer</code> should be marked up using the
  <code>address</code> element.</p>

<!-- XXX examples needed -->

  <h4>The <dfn><code>address</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <p><span title="block-level elements">Block-level
  element</span>.</p>

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>
   <dd>Where <span>block-level elements</span> are expected.</dd>
   <dt>Content model:</dt>
   <dd><span>Inline-level content</span>.</dd>
   <dt>Element-specific attributes:</dt>
   <dd>None.</dd>
   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>No difference from <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>address</code> element represents a
  <span>paragraph</span> of contact information for the section it <a
  href="#applyToSection">applies</a> to.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, a page at the W3C Web site related to HTML might
   include the following contact information:</p>
   <pre>&lt;ADDRESS>
 &lt;A href="../People/Raggett/">Dave Raggett&lt;/A>, 
 &lt;A href="../People/Arnaud/">Arnaud Le Hors&lt;/A>, 
 contact persons for the &lt;A href="Activity">W3C HTML Activity&lt;/A>
&lt;/ADDRESS></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <code>address</code> element must not be used to represent
  arbitrary addresses (e.g. postal addresses), unless those addresses
  are contact information for the section. (The <code>p</code> element
  is the appropriate element for marking up such addresses.)</p>

  <p>The <code>address</code> element must not contain information
  other than contact information.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, the following is non-conforming use of the
   <code>address</code> element:</p>
   <pre>&lt;ADDRESS>Last Modified: 1999/12/24 23:37:50&lt;/ADDRESS></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Typically, the <code>address</code> element would be included
  with other information in a <code>footer</code> element.</p>

  <p>To determine the contact information for a sectioning element
  (such as a document's <code>body</code> element, which would give the
  contact information for the page), UAs must collect all the
  <code>address</code> elements that <a
  href="#applyToSection">apply</a> to that sectioning element and its
  ancestor sectioning elements. The contact information is the
  collection of all the information given by those elements.</p>

  <p class="note">Contact information for one sectioning element, e.g.
  a <code>aside</code> element, does not apply to its ancestor
  elements, e.g. the page's <code>body</code>.</p>


  <h3>Paragraphs</h3>

  <p>A <dfn>paragraph</dfn> is typically a block of text with one or
  more sentences that discuss a particular topic, as in typography,
  but can also be used for more general thematic grouping. For
  instance, an address is also a paragraph, as is a part of a form, a
  byline, or a stanza in a poem.</p>

  <p>Paragraphs can be represented by several elements. The
  <code>address</code> element always represents a paragraph of
  contact information for its section, the <code>aside</code>,
  <code>nav</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>li</code>, and
  <code>dd</code> elements represent paragraphs with various specific
  semantics when they are <span title="Determining if a particular
  element contains block-level elements or inline-level content">used
  as inline-level content containers</span>, and the <code>p</code>
  element represents all the other kinds of paragraphs, for which
  there are no dedicated elements.</p>

  <h4>The <dfn><code>p</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <p><span title="block-level elements">Block-level
  element</span>.</p>

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>

   <dd>None.</dd>
   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>No difference from <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>p</code> element represents a
  <span>paragraph</span>.</p>

  <p><code>p</code> elements can contain a mixture of <span>strictly
  inline-level content</span>, such as text, images, hyperlinks, etc,
  and <span>structured inline-level elements</span>, such as lists,
  tables, and block quotes. <code>p</code> elements must not be <span
  title="significant inline content">empty</span>.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following examples are conforming HTML fragments:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p&gt;The little kitten gently seated himself on a piece of
carpet. Later in his life, this would be referred to as the time the
cat sat on the mat.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
   <pre>&lt;fieldset&gt;
 &lt;legend&gt;Personal information&lt;/legend&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
   &lt;label&gt;Name: &lt;input name="n"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
   &lt;label&gt;&lt;input name="anon" type="checkbox"&gt; Hide from other users&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Address: &lt;textarea name="a"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;</pre>
   <pre>&lt;p&gt;There was once an example from Femley,&lt;br&gt;
Whose markup was of dubious quality.&lt;br&gt;
The validator complained,&lt;br&gt;
So the author was pained,&lt;br&gt;
To move the error from the markup to the rhyming.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <code>p</code> element should not be used when a more
  specific element is more appropriate.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example is technically correct:</p>

<pre>&lt;section&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Last modified: 2001-04-23&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Author: fred@example.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>

   <p>However, it would be better marked-up as:</p>

 &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
 &lt;footer&gt;Last modified: 2001-04-23&lt;/footer&gt;
 &lt;address&gt;Author: fred@example.com&lt;/address&gt;

  <p>The <code>pre</code> element represents a block of preformatted
  text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions
  rather than by elements.</p>

  <p>Some examples of cases where the <code>pre</code> element could
  be used:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Including an e-mail, with paragraphs indicated by blank lines,
   lists indicated by lines prefixed with a bullet, and so on.</li>

   <li>Including fragments of computer code, with structure indicated
   according to the conventions of that language.</li>

   <li>Displaying ASCII art.</li> <!-- XXX need a note about non-visual UAs -->

  </ul>

  <p>If, ignoring text nodes consisting only of white space, the only
  child of a <code>pre</code> is a <code>code</code> element, then the
  <code>pre</code> element represents a block of computer code.</p>

  <p>If, ignoring text nodes consisting only of white space, the only
  child of a <code>pre</code> is a <code>samp</code> element, then the
  <code>pre</code> element represents a block of computer output.</p>

  <p>The <code>ol</code> element represents an ordered list of items

  <code>value</code> attribute).</p>

  <p>Each subsequent item in the list has the ordinal value given by
  its <code>value</code> attribute, if it has one, or, if it doesn't,

  <p>The <code>li</code> element represents a list item. If its parent
  element is an <code>ol</code>, <code>ul</code>, or <code>menu</code>
  element, then the element is an item of the parent element's list,
  as defined for those elements. Otherwise, the list item has no
  defined list-related relationship to any other <code>li</code>
  element.</p>

  <p>When the list item is the child of an <code>ol</code> or
  <code>ul</code> element, the content model of the item depends on
  the way that parent element was used. If it was used as structured
  inline content (i.e. if <em>that</em> element's parent was <span
  title="Determining if a particular element contains block-level
  elements or inline-level content">used as an inline-level

  elements</span>.</p>

  <p>When the list item is the child of a <code>menu</code> element,
  the <code>li</code> element must contain only <span>inline-level
  content</span>.</p>

  <p>When the list item is not the child of an <code>ol</code>,
  <code>ul</code>, or <code>menu</code> element, e.g. because it is an
  orphaned node not in the document, it may contain either for <span
  title="inline-level content">inline content</span> or
  <span>block-level elements</span>.

  <p>When <span title="Determining if a particular element contains

  <p>If the <code>value</code> attribute is present, user agents must
  <a href="#toNumber">convert the value to a numeric type</a>,
  truncating any fractional part, in order to determine the
  attribute's value. If the attribute's value cannot be converted to a
  number, it is treated as if the attribute was absent. The attribute

  <p>The <code>dl</code> element introduces an unordered association

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element is empty, it contains no groups.</p>

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element contains non-whitespace text nodes,

  those elements or text nodes do not form part of any groups in that
  <code>dl</code>, and the document is non-conforming.</p>

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element contains only <code>dt</code>
  elements, then it consists of one group with names but no values,
  and the document is non-conforming.</p>

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element contains only <code>dd</code>
  elements, then it consists of one group with values but no names,
  and the document is non-conforming.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>dl</code> element is inappropriate for
  marking up dialogue, since dialogue is ordered (each speaker/line

  <p>The <code title="attr-a-href">href</code> attribute, if

  <p>The relationship between the document containing the hyperlink
  and the destination resource indicated by the hyperlink is given by
  the value of the <dfn title="attr-a-rel"><code>rel</code></dfn>
  attribute. The <a href="#linkTypes">allowed values and their
  meanings</a> are defined in a later section. The <code
  title="attr-a-rel">rel</code> attribute has no default value. If the
  attribute is omitted or if none of the values in the attribute are
  recognised by the UA, then the document has no particular
  relationship with the destination resource other than there being a

  <!-- XXX default action of DOMActivate -->

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-a-media"><code>media</code></dfn> attribute
  describes for which media the target document was designed. It is
  purely advisory. The value must be a valid media query. <a
  href="#refsMQ">[MQ]</a> The default, if the <code
  title="attr-a-media">media</code> attribute is omitted or has an
  invalid value, is <code>all</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-a-hreflang"><code>hreflang</code></dfn>
  attribute, if present, gives the language of the linked resource. It
  is purely advisory. The value must be a valid RFC 3066 language
  code. <a href="#refsRFC3066">RFC3066</a> User agents must not
  consider this attribute authoritative &mdash; upon fetching the
  resource, user agents must only use language information associated
  with the resource to determine its language, not metadata included
  in the link to the resource.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-a-type"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute,
  if present, gives the MIME type of the linked resource. It is purely
  advisory. The value must be a valid MIME type, optionally with
  parameters. <a href="#refsRFC2046">[RFC2046]</a> User agents must
  not consider the <code title="attr-a-type">type</code> attribute
  authoritative &mdash; upon fetching the resource, user agents must
  only use the Content-Type information associated with the resource
  to determine its type, not metadata included in the link to the
  resource.</p>

  <p>The <dfn id="ping" title="attr-a-ping"><code>ping</code></dfn>
  attribute, if present, gives the URIs of the resources that are
  interested in being notified if the user follows the hyperlink. The
  value must be a space separated list of one or more URIs.</p>

  <p>If the element has an <code title="attr-a-href">href</code>
  attribute and a <code title="attr-a-ping">ping</code> attribute and
  the user follows the hyperlink, the user agent should take the <code
  title="attr-a-ping">ping</code> attribute's value, strip leading and
  trailing spaces (U+0020), split the value on sequences of spaces,
  treat each resulting part as a URI (resolving relative URIs
  according to element's base URI) and then send a request to each of
  the resulting URIs. This may be done in parallel with the primary
  request, and is independent of the result of that request.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow the user to adjust this behaviour, for
  example in conjunction with a setting that disables the sending of
  HTTP Referrer headers. Based on the user's preferences, UAs may
  either <span>ignore</span> the <code title="attr-a-ping">ping</code>
  attribute altogether, or selectively ignore URIs in the list
  (e.g. ignoring any third-party URIs).</p>

  <p>For URIs that are HTTP URIs, the requests must be performed using
  the POST method (with an empty entity body in the request). User
  agents must ignore any entity bodies returned in the responses, but
  must, unless otherwise specified by the user, honour the HTTP
  headers &mdash; in particular, HTTP cookie headers. <a
  href="#refsRFC2965">[RFC2965]</a></p>

  <p class="note">To save bandwidth, implementors might wish to
  consider omitting optional headers such as <code>Accept</code> from
  these requests.</p>

  <p>When the <code title="attr-a-ping">ping</code> attribute is
  present, user agents should clearly indicate to the user that
  following the hyperlink will also cause secondary requests to be
  sent in the background, possibly including listing the actual target
  URIs.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p>The <code title="attr-a-ping">ping</code> attribute is redundant
   with pre-existing technologies like HTTP redirects and JavaScript
   in allowing Web pages to track which off-site links are most
   popular or allowing advertisers to track click-through rates.</p>

   <p>However, the <code title="attr-a-ping">ping</code> attribute
   provides these advantages to the user over those alternatives:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>It allows the user to see the final target URI
    unobscured.</li>

    <li>It allows the UA to inform the user about the out-of-band
    notifications.</li>

    <li>It allows the paranoid user to disable the notifications
    without losing the underlying link functionality.</li>

    <li>It allows the UA to optimise the use of available network
    bandwidth so that the target page loads faster.</li>

   </ul>
  
   <p>Thus, while it is possible to track users without this feature,
   authors are encouraged to use the <code
   title="attr-a-ping">ping</code> attribute so that the user agent
   can improve <!-- XXX optimise? --> the user experience.</p> <!--
   XXX need a better way to end that sentence. It's what I mean, but

  <p>The <code>em</code> element represents stress emphasis of its
  contents.</p>

  <p>The level of emphasis that a particlar piece of content has is
  given by its number of ancestor <code>em</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The placement of emphasis changes the meaning of the sentence.
  The element thus forms an integral part of the content. The precise
  way in which emphasis is used in this way depends on the
  language.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>These examples show how changing the emphasis changes the
   meaning. First, a general statement of fact, with no emphasis:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Cats are cute animals.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>By emphasising the first word, the statement implies that the
   kind of animal under discussion is in question (maybe someone is
   asserting that dogs are cute):</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats&lt;/em> are cute animals.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Moving the emphasis to the verb, one highlights that the truth
   of the entire sentence is in question (maybe someone is saying cats
   are not cute):</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Cats &lt;em>are&lt;/em> cute animals.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>By moving it to the adjective, the exact nature of the cats
   is reasserted (maybe someone suggested cats were <em>mean</em>
   animals):</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Cats are &lt;em>cute&lt;/em> animals.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Similarly, if someone asserted that cats were vegetables,
   someone correcting this might emphasise the last word:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Cats are cute &lt;em>animals&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>By emphasising the entire sentence, it becomes clear that the
   speaker is fighting hard to get the point across. This kind of
   emphasis also typically affects the punctuation, hence the
   exclamation mark here.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats are cute animals!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Anger mixed with emphasising the cuteness could lead to markup
   such as:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats are &lt;em>cute&lt;/em> animals!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></pre>

  <p>The <code>abbr</code> element represents an abbreviation or
  acronym. The <dfn title="attr-abbr-title"><code>title</code></dfn>
  attribute should be used to provide an expansion of the
  abbreviation. If present, the attribute must only contain an
  expansion of the abbreviation.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The paragraph below contains an abbreviation marked up with the
   <code>abbr</code> element.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the example below, the word "Zat" is used as an abbreviation
   in the second paragraph. The abbreviation is defined in the first,

  <p>The <code>meter</code> element represents a scalar measurement
  within a known range, or a fractional value; for example disk usage,
  the relevance of a query result, or the fraction of a voting
  population to have selected a particular candidate.</p>

  <p>This is also known as a gauge.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>meter</code> element should not be used to
  indicate progress (as in a progress bar). For that role, HTML
  provides a separate <code>progress</code> element.</p>

  <p>There are six attributes that determine the semantics of the
  gauge represented by the element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-meter-min"><code>min</code></dfn> attribute
  specifies the lower bound of the range, and the <dfn
  title="attr-meter-max"><code>max</code></dfn> attribute specifies
  the upper bound. The <dfn
  title="attr-meter-value"><code>value</code></dfn> attribute
  specifies the value to have the gauge indicate as the "measured"
  value.</p>

  <p>The other three attributes can be used to segment the gauge's
  range into "low", "medium", and "high" parts, and to indicate which
  part of the gauge is the "optimum" part. The <dfn
  title="attr-meter-low"><code>low</code></dfn> attribute specifies
  the range that is considered to be the "low" part, and the <dfn
  title="attr-meter-high"><code>high</code></dfn> attribute specifies
  the range that is considered to be the "high" part. The <dfn
  title="attr-meter-optimum"><code>optimum</code></dfn> attribute
  gives the position that is "optimum"; if that is higher than the
  "high" value  then this indicates that the higher the value, the
  better; if it's lower than the "low" mark then it indicates that
  lower values are better, and naturally if it is in between then it
  indicates that neither high nor low values are good.</p>

  <p><strong>Authoring requirements</strong>: The recommended way of
  giving the value is to include it as contents of the element, either
  as two numbers (the higher number represents the maximum, the other
  number the current value), or as a percentage or similar (using one
  of the characters such as "%"), or as a fraction.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-min">min</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-low">low</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-high">high</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-max">max</code>, and <code
  title="attr-meter-optimum">optimum</code> attributes are all
  optional. When present, they must have values that are <span
  title="valid floating point number">valid floating point
  numbers</span>.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following examples all represent a measurement of three
   quarters (of the maximum of whatever is being measured):</p>

   <pre>&lt;meter>75%&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter>750&#x2030;&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter>3/4&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter>6 blocks used (out of 8 total)&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter>max: 100; current: 75&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter>&lt;object data="graph75.png">0.75&lt;/object>&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter min="0" max="100" value="75">&lt;/meter></pre>

  </div>

  <p><strong>User agent requirements</strong>: User agents must parse
  the <code title="attr-meter-min">min</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-max">max</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-value">value</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-low">low</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-high">high</code>, and <code
  title="attr-meter-optimum">optimum</code> attributes using the
  <span>rules for parsing floating point number values</span>.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code> attribute has
  been omitted, the user agent must also process the
  <code>textContent</code> of the element according to the <span>steps
  for finding one or two numbers in a string</span>. These steps will
  return nothing, one number, one number with a denominator
  punctuation character, or two numbers.</p>

  <p>User agents must then use all these numbers to obtain values for
  six points on the gauge, as follows. (The order in which these are
  evaluated is important, as some of the values refer to earlier
  ones.)</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>The minimum value</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-min">min</code> attribute is
    specified and a value could be parsed out of it, then the minimum
    value is that value. Otherwise, the minimum value is zero.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>The maximum value</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-max">max</code> attribute is
    specified and a value could be parsed out of it, the maximum
    value is that value.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if the <code title="attr-meter-max">max</code>
    attribute is specified but no value could be parsed out of it, or
    if it was not specified, but either or both of the <code
    title="attr-meter-min">min</code> or <code
    title="attr-meter-value">value</code> attributes <em>were</em>
    specified, then the maximum value is 1.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, none of the <code title="attr-meter-max">max</code>,
    <code title="attr-meter-min">min</code>, and <code
    title="attr-meter-value">value</code> attributes were
    specified. If the result of processing the
    <code>textContent</code> of the element was either nothing or just
    one number with no denominator punctuation character, then the
    maximum value is 1; if the result was one number but it had an
    associated denominator punctuation character, then the maximum
    value is the <span title="values associated with denominator
    punctuation characters">value associated with that denominator
    punctuation character</span>; and finally, if there were two
    numbers parsed out of the <code>textContent</code>, then the
    maximum is the higher of those two numbers.</p>

    <p>If the above machinations result in a maximum value less than
    the minimum value, then the maximum value is actually the same as
    the minimum value.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>The actual value</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code> attribute is
    specified and a value could be parsed out of it, then that value
    is the actual value.</p>

    <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code> attribute is
    not specified but the <code title="attr-meter-max">max</code>
    attribute <em>is</em> specified and the result of processing the
    <code>textContent</code> of the element was one number with no
    associated denominator punctuation character, then that number is
    the actual value.</p>

    <p>If neither of the <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code>
    and <code title="attr-meter-max">max</code> attributes are
    specified, then, if the result of processing the
    <code>textContent</code> of the element was one number (with or
    without an associated denominator punctuation character), then
    that is the actual value, and if the result of processing the
    <code>textContent</code> of the element was two numbers, then the
    actual value is the lower of the two numbers found.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if none of the above apply, the actual value is
    zero.</p>

    <p>If the above procedure results in an actual value less than
    the minimum value, then the actual value is actually the same as
    the minimum value.</p>

    <p>If, on the other hand, the result is an actual value greater
    than the maximum value, then the actual value is the maximum
    value.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>The low boundary</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code> attribute is
    specified and a value could be parsed out of it, then the low
    boundary is that value. Otherwise, the low boundary is the same as
    the minimum value.</p>

    <p>If the above results in a low boundary that is less than the
    minimum value, the low boundary is the minimum value.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>The high boundary</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-high">high</code> attribute is
    specified and a value could be parsed out of it, then the high
    boundary is that value. Otherwise, the high boundary is the same
    as the maximum value.</p>

    <p>If the above results in a high boundary that is higher than the
    maximum value, the high boundary is the maximum value.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>The optimum point</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-optimum">optimum</code>
    attribute is specified and a value could be parsed out of it, then
    the optimum point is that value. Otherwise, the optimum point is
    the midpoint between the minimum value and the maximum value.</p>

    <p>If the optimum point is then less than the minimum value, then
    the optimum point is actually the same as the minimum
    value. Similarly, if the optimum point is greater than the maximum
    value, then it is actually the maximum value instead.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>All of which should result in the following inequalities all
  being true:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li>minimum value &le; actual value &le; maximum value</li>
   <li>minimum value &le; low boundary &le; high boundary &le; maximum value</li>
   <li>minimum value &le; optimum point &le; maximum value</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>UA requirements for regions of the gauge</strong>: If the
  optimum point is equal to the low boundary or the high boundary, or
  anywhere in between them, then the region between the low and high
  boundaries of the gauge must be treated as the optimum region, and
  the low and high parts, if any, must be treated as
  suboptimal. Otherwise, if the optimum point is less than the low
  boundary, then the region between the minimum value and the low
  boundary must be treated as the optimum region, the region between
  the low boundary and the high boundary must be treated as a
  suboptimal region, and the region between the high boundary and the
  maximum value must be treated as an even less good region. Finally,
  if the optimum point is higher than the high boundary, then the
  situation is reversed; the region between the high boundary and the
  maximum value must be treated as the optimum region, the region
  between the high boundary and the low boundary must be treated as a
  suboptimal region, and the remaining region between the low boundary
  and the minimum value must be treated as an even less good
  region.</p>

  <p><strong>UA requirements for showing the gauge</strong>: When
  representing a <code>meter</code> element to the user, the UA should
  indicate the relative position of the actual value to the minimum
  and maximum values, and the relationship between the actual value
  and the three regions of the gauge.</p>

  <p>The <code>progress</code> element represents the completion
  progress of a task. The progress is either indeterminate, indicating
  that progress is being made but that it is not clear how much more
  work remains to be done before the task is complete (e.g. because
  the task is waiting for a remote host to respond), or the progress
  is a number in the range zero to a maximum, giving the fraction of
  work that has so far been completed.</p>

  <p>There are two attributes that determine the current task
  completion represented by the element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-progress-value"><code>value</code></dfn>
  attribute specifies how much of the task has been completed, and the
  <dfn title="attr-progress-max"><code>max</code></dfn> attribute
  specifies how much work the task requires in total. The units are
  arbitrary and not specified.</p>

  <p>Instead of using the attributes, authors are recommended to
  simply include the current value and the maximum value inline as
  text inside the element.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Here is a snippet of a Web application that shows the progress
   of some automated task:</p>
   <pre>&lt;section>
 &lt;h2>Task Progress&lt;/h2>

  <p><strong>Author requirements</strong>: The <code

  must have values that are <span title="valid floating point
  number">valid floating point numbers</span>. The <code
  title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute, if present, must
  have a value greater than zero. The <code
  title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute, if present, must
  have a value equal to or greater than zero, and less than or equal
  to the value of the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code>
  attribute, if present.</p>

  <p><strong>User agent requirements</strong>: User agents must parse
  the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> and <code
  title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attributes' values
  according to the <span>rules for parsing floating point number
  values</span>.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute
  is omitted, then user agents must also parse the
  <code>textContent</code> of the <code>progress</code> element in
  question using the <span>steps for finding one or two numbers in a
  string</span>. These steps will return nothing, one number, one
  number with a denominator punctuation character, or two numbers.</p>

  <p>Using the results of this processing, user agents must determine
  whether the progress bar is an indeterminate progress bar, or
  whether it is a determinate progress bar, and in the latter case,
  what its current and maximum values are, all as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is
   omitted, and the <code title="attr-progress-value">value</code> is
   omitted, and the results of parsing the <code>textContent</code>
   was nothing, then the progress bar is an indeterminate progress
   bar. Abort these steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, it is a determinate progress bar.</li>

   <li>If the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is
   included, then, if a value could be parsed out of it, then the
   maximum value is that value.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code>
   attribute is absent but the <code
   title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute is present, or,
   if the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is
   present but no value could be parsed from it, then the maximum is
   1.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if neither attribute is included, then, if the
   <code>textContent</code> contained one number with an associated
   denominator punctuation character, then the maximum value is the
   <span>value associated with that denominator punctuation
   character</span>; otherwise, if the <code>textContent</code>
   contained two numbers, the maximum value is the higher of the two
   values; otherwise, the maximum value is 1.</li>

   <li>If the <code title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute
   is present on the element and a value could be parsed out of it,
   that value is the current value of the progress bar. Otherwise, if
   the attribute is present but no value could be parsed from it, the
   current value is zero.</li>

   <li>Otherwise if the <code title="attr-progress-value">value</code>
   attribute is absent and the <code
   title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is present, then, if
   the <code>textContent</code> was parsed and found to contain just
   one number, with no associated denominator punctuation character,
   then the current value is that number. Otherwise, if the <code
   title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute is absent and
   the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is present
   then the current value is zero.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if neither attribute is present, then the current
   value is the lower of the one or two numbers that were found in the
   <code>textContent</code> of the element.</li>

   <li>If the maximum value is less than or equal to zero, then it is
   reset to 1.</li>

   <li>If the current value is less than zero, then it is reset to
   zero.</li>

   <li>Finally, if the current value is greater than the maximum
   value, then the current value is reset to the maximum value.</li>

  </ol>

  <p><strong>UA requirements for showing the progress bar</strong>:
  When representing a <code>progress</code> element to the user, the
  UA should indicate whether it is a determinate or indeterminate
  progress bar, and in the former case, should indicate the relative

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>kbd</code> element represents user input (typically
  keyboard input, although it may also be used to represent other
  input, such as voice commands).</p>

  <p>When the <code>kbd</code> element is nested inside a
  <code>samp</code> element, it represents the input as it was echoed
  by the system.</p>

  <p>When the <code>kbd</code> element <em>contains</em> a
  <code>samp</code> element, it represents input based on system
  output, for example invoking a menu item.</p>

  <p>When the <code>kbd</code> element is nested inside another
  <code>kbd</code> element, it represents an actual key or other
  single unit of input as appropriate for the input mechanism.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Here the <code>kbd</code> element is used to indicate keys to press:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>To make George eat an apple, press &lt;kbd>&lt;kbd>Shift&lt;/kbd>+&lt;kbd>F3&lt;/kbd>&lt;/kbd>&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>In this second example, the user is told to pick a particular
   menu item. The outer <code>kbd</code> element marks up a block of
   input, with the inner <code>kbd</code> elements representing each
   individual step of the input, and the <code>samp</code> elements
   inside them indicating that the steps are input based on something
   being displayed by the system, in this case menu labels:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>To make George eat an apple, select
    &lt;kbd>&lt;kbd>&lt;samp>File&lt;/samp>&lt;/kbd>|&lt;kbd>&lt;samp>Eat Apple...&lt;/samp>&lt;/kbd>&lt;/kbd>

   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>No difference from <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>sup</code> element represents a superscript and the
  <code>sub</code> element represents a subscript.</p>

  <p>These elements must only be used to mark up typographical
  conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical
  presentation for presentation's sake. For example, it would be
  inappropriate for the <code>sup</code> and <code>sub</code> elements
  to be used in the name of the LaTeX document preparation system. In
  general, authors should not use these elements if the
  <em>absence</em> of those elements would not change the meaning of
  the content.</p>

  <p>When the <code>sub</code> element is used inside a
  <code>var</code> element, it represents the subscript that
  identifies the variable in a family of variables.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <pre>&lt;p>The coordinate of the &lt;var>i&lt;/var>th point is
(&lt;var>x&lt;sub>&lt;var>i&lt;/var>&lt;/sub>&lt;/var>, &lt;var>y&lt;sub>&lt;var>i&lt;/var>&lt;/sub>&lt;/var>).
For example, the 10th point has coordinate
(&lt;var>x&lt;sub>10&lt;/sub>&lt;/var>, &lt;var>y&lt;sub>10&lt;/sub>&lt;/var>).&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <p>In certain languages, superscripts are part of the typographical
  conventions for some abbreviations.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <pre>&lt;p>The most beautiful women are
&lt;span lang="fr">&lt;abbr>M&lt;sup>lle&lt;/sup>&lt;/abbr> Gwendoline&lt;/span> and 
&lt;span lang="fr">&lt;abbr>M&lt;sup>me&lt;/sup>&lt;/abbr> Denise&lt;/span>.&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Mathematical expressions often use subscripts and superscripts.
  <!--Authors are encouraged to use MathML for marking up mathematics, but
  authors may opt to use <code>sub</code> and <code>sup</code> if
  detailed mathematical markup is not desired. <a

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>bdo</code> element allows authors to override the

  <p>Authors must specify the <code title="attr-dir">dir</code> attribute on this
  element, with the value <code>ltr</code> to specify a left-to-right
  override and with the value <code>rtl</code> to specify a
  right-to-left override.</p>

  <p>If the element has the <code title="attr-dir">dir</code> attribute set to the
  exact value <code>ltr</code>, then for the purposes of the bidi
  algorithm, the user agent must act as if there was a U+202D
  LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE character at the start of the element, and a
  U+202C POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING at the end of the element.</p>

  <p>If the element has the <code title="attr-dir">dir</code> attribute set to the

  U+202C POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING at the end of the element.</p>

  <p>The requirements on handling the <code>bdo</code> element for the

  <h4>Attributes common to <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-mod-cite"><code>cite</code></dfn> attribute
  may be used to specify a URI that explains the change. When that
  document is long, for instance the minutes of a meeting, authors are
  encouraged to include a fragment identifier pointing to the specific
  part of that document that discusses the change.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-mod-cite">cite</code> attribute is
  present, it must be a URI (or IRI) that explains the change. User
  agents should allow users to follow such citation links.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-mod-datetime"><code>datetime</code></dfn>
  attribute may be used to specify the time and date of the change.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">This next bit should be extracted to the "common microsyntaxes" section</p>
  <p>If the <code title="attr-mod-datetime">datetime</code> attribute
  is present, it must have a value consisting of four digits
  representing the year, a literal hyphen, two digits representing the
  month, a literal hyphen, two digits representing the day, a literal
  T, two digits for the hour, a colon, two digits for the minutes,
  another colon, two digits for the seconds, optionally a decimal
  point followed by one or more digits for the fraction of a second,
  and finally either a literal Z, or, a plus sign or a minus sign
  followed by two digits for the hour offset, a colon, and two digits
  for the minute offset.</p>

  <p>In other words:
  <code><var title="">YYYY</var>-<var title="">MM</var>-<var title="">DD</var>T<var title="">hh</var>:<var title="">mm</var>:<var title="">ss</var>.<var title="">s</var><var title="">TZ</var></code></p>

  <p>Digits must be in the range 0-9 (U+0030 to U+0039), interpreted
  in base ten. The hyphen must be U+002D, the T must be U+0054, the
  colon must be U+003A, the Z must be U+005A, the plus must be U+002B,
  and the minus U+002D (same as the hyphen).</p>

  <p>To interpret this value, user agents must first check to see if
  the value matches the pattern described here. If it does, then the
  values must be extracted and interpreted as a date and time with a
  timezone offset, as per ISO 8601. <a
  href="#refsISO8601">[ISO8601]</a></p> <!-- XXX we shouldn't refer to
  ISO8601 for that, we should define it outselves -->

  <p>If the attribute value does not match the format, or, if the date
  or time given is not a valid date and time (e.g. because the month
  is out of range) then the user agent must <span>ignore</span> the
  attribute (the modification has no associated timestamp).</p>

  <p>The <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements must implement

  <p>The <code>script</code> element allows authors to include dynamic
  script in their documents.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn title="attr-script-src"><code>src</code></dfn>
  attribute is set, the <code>script</code> element refers to an
  external file. The value of the attribute must be a URI.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-script-src">src</code> attribute is not
  set, then the script is given by the contents of the element.</p>

  <p>The language of the script is given by the <dfn
  title="attr-script-type"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute. The
  value must be a valid MIME type, optionally with parameters. <a

  <p class="big-issue">Define defer/async attributes for authors.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">Do we really want this attribute to be called

  title="attr-script-async">async</code> attributes dynamically has no
  direct effect; these attribute are only used at specific times
  described below (namely, when the element is inserted into the
  document).</p>

  <p><code>script</code> elements have two associated pieces of
  metadata. The first is a flag indicating whether or not the script
  block has been <dfn>"already executed"</dfn>. Initially,
  <code>script</code> elements must have this flag unset (script
  blocks, when created, are not "already executed"). When a
  <code>script</code> element is cloned, the "already executed" flag,
  if set, must be propagated to the clone when it is created. The
  second is a flag indicating whether the element was
  <dfn>"parser-inserted"</dfn>. This flag is set by the <span>HTML
  parser</span> and is used to handle <code
  title="dom-document-write-HTML">document.write()</code> calls.</p>

  <p><dfn title="running a script">When a script block is inserted
  into a document</dfn>: When a <code>script</code> element whose
  <span>"already executed"</span> flag is not set is <span>inserted
  into a document</span><!-- XXX xref -->, the user agent must act as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must set the element's <span>"already
    executed"</span> flag.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p class="big-issue">How to handle the <code title="">type</code>
    and <code title="">language</code> attributes should be defined
    here, probably with reference to the next section.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the element has a <code title="attr-script-src">src</code>
    attribute, then a load for the specified content must be
    started.</p>

    <p class="note">Later, once the load has completed, the user agent
    will have to complete <span title="when a script completes

    <p>For performance reasons, user agents may start loading the
    script as soon as the attribute is set, instead, in the hope that
    the element will be inserted into the document. Either way, once
    the element is inserted into the document, the load must have
    started. If the UA performs such prefetching, but the element is
    never inserted in the document, or the <code
    title="attr-script-src">src</code> attribute is dynamically
    changed, then the user agent will not execute the script, and the
    load will have been effectively wasted.</p>

  <p class="big-issue"><!-- XXX --> need to say, in the part of the

  triggered.</p>

  <p><dfn title="executing a script block">Executing a script
  block</dfn>: If the load resulted in an error (for example a DNS
  error, or an HTTP 404 error), then executing the script consists of
  doing nothing. If the load was successful, then the behaviour
  depends on the scripting language.

  <p>If the script is from an external file, then that file must be
  used as the file to execute.</p>

  <p>If the script is inline, then, for scripting languages that
  consist of pure text, user agents must use the value of the DOM
  <code title="dom-script-text">text</code> attribute (defined below)
  as the script to execute, and for XML-based scripting languages,
  user agents must use all the child nodes of the <code>script</code>
  element as the script to execute.</p>

  <p>In any case, the user agent must execute the script according to
  the semantics of the relevant language specification, as determined
  by the <code title="attr-script-type">type</code> and <code
  title="attr-script-language">language</code> attributes on the
  <code>script</code> element when the element was inserted into the
  document, as described above.</p>

  <p class="note">The element's attributes' values might have changed
  between when the element was inserted into the document and when the
  script has finished loading, as may its other attributes; similarly,
  the element itself might have been taken back out of the DOM, or had
  other changes made. These changes do not in any way affect the above
  steps; only the values of the attributes at the time the
  <code>script</code> element is first inserted into the document
  matter.</p>

  <p>The DOM attributes <dfn
  title="dom-script-src"><code>src</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-script-type"><code>type</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-script-defer"><code>defer</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-script-async"><code>async</code></dfn>, each
  <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the same
  name.</p>

  <p>The DOM attribute <dfn
  title="dom-script-text"><code>text</code></dfn> must return a
  concatenation of the contents of all the text nodes and CDATA nodes
  that are direct children of the <code>script</code> element
  (ignoring any other nodes such as comments or elements), in tree
  order. On setting, it must act the same way as the
  <code>textContent</code> DOM attribute.</p>


  <h5>Script languages</h5>

  <p>The following lists some MIME types and the languages to which
  they refer:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><code>text/javascript</code></dt>
   <dd>ECMAScript. <a href="#refsECMA262">[ECMA262]</a></dd>

   <dd>ECMAScript with ECMAScript for XML. <a href="#refsECMA357">[ECMA357]</a></dd>

  </dl>

  <p>User agents may support other MIME types and other languages.</p>

  <p>When examining types to determine if they support the language,
  user agents must not ignore unknown MIME parameters &mdash; types
  with unknown parameters must be assumed to be unsupported.</p>

  <h4>Document sections</h4>

  <p>User agents must support all of the common attributes and event
  handlers on the <code>section</code> element, as well as the
  <code>active</code> attribute (for use with <span>mutually exclusive
  sections</span>).</p>

  <p>In CSS-aware user agents, the default presentation of this
  element should be achieved by including the following rules, or
  their equivalent, in the UA's user agent style sheet:</p>

  <pre>@namespace xh url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);
xh|section { display: block; margin: 1em 0; }</pre>

  <h4>Section headers</h4>

  <p>For <code>h1</code> elements, CSS-aware visual user agents should
  derive the size of the header from the level of <code>section</code>
  nesting. This effect should be achieved by including the following
  rules, or their equivalent, in the UA's user agent style sheet:</p>

  <pre>@namespace xh url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);
xh|section xh|h1 { /* same styles as h2 */ }
xh|section xh|section xh|h1 { /* same styles as h4 */ }
xh|section xh|section xh|section xh|h1 { /* same styles as h4 */ }
xh|section xh|section xh|section xh|section xh|h1 { /* same styles as h5 */ }
xh|section xh|section xh|section xh|section xh|section xh|h1 { /* same styles as h6 */ }</pre>

  <p>Authors should use <code>h1</code> elements to denote headers in
  sections. Authors may instead use <code>h2</code> ...
  <code>h6</code> elements, for backwards compatibility with user
  agents that do not support <code>section</code> elements.</p>


  <h4><dfn>Section groups</dfn> (tabs)</h4>

  <p class="issue">This section should probably die.</p>

  <p>A group of related, order-neutral sections may be denoted using
  the <dfn><code>tabbox</code></dfn> element. The default presentation
  in a visual media (as described below) is to render each section as
  a separate tab in a tab box, allowing the user to switch between
  them. Sections can also be represented by links to other documents,
  instead of them being included literally in the markup.</p>

  <p>The <code>tabbox</code> element is a block-level element that
  should only contain <code>section</code>, <code>fieldset</code>, and
  <code>a</code> elements.</p>

  <p>Authors should only use <code>a</code> elements that cause the
  user agent to change the active page to a page with a similar
  structure. Other behaviours are likely to be highly confusing to
  users.</p>

  <p>Each <code>section</code>, <code>fieldset</code>, and
  <code>a</code> child can have a title. If the element is a
  <code>section</code> element, then the title is taken from the <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute of the element, if
  specified, or, if absent, from the <code>textContent</code> DOM
  attribute of the first element child of the <code>section</code>
  element, if that is an <code>h1</code> ... <code>h6</code> element.
  (If it is taken from a header child, then that child is hidden from
  the rendering.) If the element is a <code>fieldset</code> element,
  then the title is taken from the <code>textContent</code> DOM
  attribute of the first element child of the <code>fieldset</code>
  element, if that is an <code>legend</code> element. If the element
  is an <code>a</code> element, then the title is taken from the
  <code>textContent</code> DOM attribute of the element. (Titles may
  be the empty string.)</p>
  
  <p>The titles obtained in this way, and the <code>section</code>,
  <code>fieldset</code>, and <code>a</code> elements from which they
  were derived, represent the list of sections in the
  <code>tabbox</code>. This list is <em>live</em>, in that dynamic
  changes to the DOM immediately affect the representation of the
  <code>tabbox</code> element.</p>

  <p>All the other child nodes of the <code>tabbox</code> must be
  <span title="ignore">ignored</span> for the purposes of rendering
  the <code>tabbox</code>.  Authors may use this in order to obtain
  acceptable renderings even in UAs that do not support
  <code>tabbox</code>.</p>

  <p>In CSS-aware user agents, the default presentation of the
  <code>tabbox</code> element should, in part, be achieved by
  including the following rules, or their equivalent, in the UA's user
  agent style sheet:</p>

  <pre>@namespace xh url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);
xh|tabbox { display: block; }
xh|tabbox > xh|section:not([title]) > xh|h1:first-child,
xh|tabbox > xh|section:not([title]) > xh|h2:first-child,
xh|tabbox > xh|section:not([title]) > xh|h3:first-child,
xh|tabbox > xh|section:not([title]) > xh|h4:first-child,
xh|tabbox > xh|section:not([title]) > xh|h5:first-child,
xh|tabbox > xh|section:not([title]) > xh|h6:first-child,
xh|tabbox > xh|fieldset > xh|legend:first-child { display: none; }</pre>

  <p>These rules do not come even close to fully describing the full
  behaviour of a <code>tabbox</code> element, however.</p>

  <p>The behaviour of the <code>tabbox</code> should be to provide
  quick access to any of the children of the <code>tabbox</code> that
  have a title (as described above). UAs may keep track of which
  section is the selected section, and report this information to the
  user.</p>

  <p>When the user specifies a section to access, the relevant element
  must have <span title="fire a click event">a <code
  title="">click</code> event dispatched to it</span>, whose default
  action is to further dispatch a <code>DOMActivate</code> event to
  the element.</p> <!-- XXX need to define the dispatching of
  DOMActivate in the same way we define the dispatching of click -->

  <p>For <code>section</code> and <code>fieldset</code> elements, the
  default action of <code>DOMActivate</code> events is to display, or
  jump to, the relevant section. For <code>a</code> elements, the
  default action is the normal default action for <code>a</code>
  elements (activating the link, command, or whatever). In addition to
  these default actions, when a child of a <code>tabbox</code> is
  accessed, it becomes the selected section.</p>

  <p>If the <code>DOMActivate</code> event is canceled (or if the
  <code title="event-click">click</code> event is canceled, causing
  the <code>DOMActivate</code> event to never be fired in the first
  place), then the selected section does not change.</p>

  <p>If an <code>a</code> element has a <code
  title="command-attribute">command</code> attribute, it can be
  disabled. In such cases, the UA should not allow the user to select
  that section.</p>

  <p>The initially selected section shall be the first element from
  the <code>tabbox</code> element's child list that is:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>an <code>a</code> element whose <code>href</code> attribute
   matches the URI of the current document, if there is one,</li>
   <li>otherwise, the first <code>a</code> element whose
   <code>href</code> attribute matches the URI given by the
   <code>href</code> attribute of the first <code>link</code> element
   in the document that has a <code>rel</code> attribute whose value
   contains the keyword <code>up</code> (treating that attribute as a
   space-separated list), if there is one,</li>
   <li>otherwise, the first <code>section</code> or
   <code>fieldset</code> element that has a title, if there is one.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If no elements match, then initially no section shall be
  selected.</p>

  <p>In the above algorithm, URI comparisons should be done after
  canonicalisation, and should ignore fragment identifiers unless the
  <code>a</code> element in question has one.</p>

  <p>In non-interactive or non-spatial media (such as in print, on
  braille systems, or with speech synthesis) the UA may automatically
  switch the selected section to the next section once the selected
  section has been rendered.</p>

  <p>Which section is selected if the element representing the
  currently selected section is dynamically removed from the document
  is up to the UA.</p>

  <p>In interactive visual media, the <code>tabbox</code> element
  should be rendered as a tab box, with the section titles listed as
  the tabs, and the selected section (if it is a <code>section</code>
  or <code>fieldset</code> element) displayed in the tab panel area.
  When the selected section is an <code>a</code> element, the tab
  panel area should be empty.</p>

  <p>This specification does not describe how CSS properties apply to
  <code>tabbox</code> elements when the UA uses this rendering, but
  the children rendered in the tab panel area must be styled using
  CSS, as if the tab panel area defined a new containing block and new
  block formatting context.</p>

  <p>User agents must support all of the common attributes and event
  handlers on the <code>tabbox</code> element.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here is an example of a <code>tabbox</code> used to allow the
   user to read three different parts of the document:</p>

   <pre>&lt;tabbox&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="logo" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&copy; copyright 2004 by The First Team.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Jack O'Neill&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Samantha Carter&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Daniel Jackson&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Teal'c&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Jonas Quinn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/tabbox&gt;</pre>

   <p>Next, an example of a form that has been split into little
   groups of controls:</p>

   <pre>&lt;tabbox&gt;
 &lt;fieldset&gt;
  &lt;legend&gt;Identity&lt;/legend&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;First name: &lt;input name="fn"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Last name: &lt;input name="ln"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Date of Birth: &lt;input name="dob" type="date"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/fieldset&gt;
 &lt;fieldset&gt;
  &lt;legend&gt;Food&lt;/legend&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Favourite appetizer: &lt;input name="fa"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Favourite meal: &lt;input name="fm"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Favourite desert: &lt;input name="fd"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;/tabbox&gt;</pre>

   <p>Finally, an example of a page using a <code>tabbox</code> to
   point to sections outside the document. Note the use of fallback
   content (elements and text in the <code>tabbox</code> element that
   are not <code>fieldset</code>, <code>section</code>, or
   <code>a</code> elements) for backwards compatibility.</p>

   <pre>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;tabbox&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Navigation:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;a href="/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
  &lt;a href="/news/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
  &lt;a href="/games/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Games&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
  &lt;a href="/help/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
  &lt;a href="/contact/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 &lt;/tabbox&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

   <p>This would be semantically equivalent to the following:</p>

   <pre>&lt;tabbox&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Home&lt;/h2&gt; <em>...content...</em> &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt; <em>...content...</em> &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt; <em>...content...</em> &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Help&lt;/h2&gt; <em>...content...</em> &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Contact&lt;/h2&gt; <em>...content...</em> &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/tabbox&gt;</pre>

  </div>

  <h4><dfn>Mutually exclusive sections</dfn></h4>

  <p>The <dfn><code>switch</code></dfn> element represents a block of
  mutually exclusive sections.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, in an application for an online
  mutiplayer game, there could be four mutually exclusive sections:
  one for the login page, one for the network status page displayed
  while the user is logging in, one for a "lobby" where players get
  together to organise a game, and one for the actual game. The
  different sections are the various states that the application can
  reach.</p>

  <p>The <code>switch</code> element must contain only <span>block-level
  elements</span>. User agents must support all of the common attributes and
  event handlers on the <code>switch</code> element.</p>

  <p>All child elements of a <code>switch</code> element shall be
  hidden except those that have <code>active</code> attributes (or,
  for non-XHTML elements, <code>active</code> attributes in the
  <span>HTML namespace</span>).</p>

  <p>In CSS-aware user agents, the default presentation of this
  element should be achieved by including the following rules, or
  their equivalent, in the UA's user agent style sheet:</p>

  <pre>@namespace xh url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);
xh|switch { display: block; }
xh|switch xh|*:not([active]) { display: none; }
xh|switch *:not([xh|active]) { display: none; }</pre>

  <h4>Using <code>switch</code> and <code>section</code></h4>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>HTMLSwitchElement</dfn> : <span>HTMLElement</span> {
  readonly attribute Element           activeElement;
  void setActive(in Element element);
};

interface <dfn>HTMLSectionElement</dfn> : <span>HTMLElement</span> {
  readonly attribute boolean           active;
  void setActive();
};</pre>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>When an element is added to a <code>switch</code> element as a
  child (whether during parsing, or later), the element is examined.
  If the element has an <code>active</code> attribute (or, if it is a
  non-XHTML element, if it has an <code>active</code> attribute in the
  <span>HTML namespace</span>), or, if the <code>switch</code>
  element's <code>activeElement</code> DOM attribute is null, then the
  <code>switch</code> element's <code>setActive</code> method is
  called with that element as the argument. This causes the element to
  be made the active element for the switch, and causes any other
  elements to be deactivated if needed.</p>

  <p>A side-effect of this definition is that the first element in a
  <code>switch</code> element is the default element if none have been
  explicitly marked as active.</p>


  <h3><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Calendars: event data <span title="TBW">[TBW]</span></h3>

  <p class="big-issue">Rendering will be described in the Rendering
  section in due course. Basically CSS :open and :closed match the
  element, it's a block-level element by default, and when it matches
  :closed it renders as if it had an XBL binding attached to it whose
  template was just <code>&lt;template>&#x25B6;&lt;content
  includes="legend:first-child"&gt;Details&lt;/content>&lt;/template></code>,
  and when it's :open it acts as if it had an XBL binding attached to
  it whose template was just <code>&lt;template>&#x25BC;&lt;content
  includes="legend:first-child"&gt;Details&lt;/content>&lt;content/>&lt;/template></code>
  or some such.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">Clicking the legend would make it open/close
  (and would change the content attribute). Question: Do we want the
  content attribute to reflect the actual state like this? I think we
  do, the DOM not reflecting state has been a pain in the neck
  before. But is it semantically ok?</p>

  looking in and not descendants looking out.</p>

  <p>The <code>datagrid</code> element represents an interactive
  representation of tree, list, or tabular data.</p>

  <p>The data being presented can come either from the content, as
  elements given as children of the <code>datagrid</code> element, or
  from a scripted data provider given by the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> DOM attribute.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-datagrid-multiple">multiple</code>
  attribute, if present, must be either empty or have the literal
  value <code title="">multiple</code>. Similarly, the <code
  title="attr-datagrid-disabled">disabled</code> attribute, if
  present, must be either empty or have the literal value <code
  title="">disabled</code>. (The actual values do not have any effect
  on how these attributes are processed, only the presence or absence
  of the attributes is important.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-multiple"><code>multiple</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn> DOM
  attributes <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-datagrid-multiple">multiple</code> and <code
  title="attr-datagrid-disabled">disabled</code> content attributes
  respectively.</p>


  <h5>The <code>datagrid</code> data model</h5>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>In the <code>datagrid</code> data model, data is structured as a
  set of rows representing a tree, each row being split into a number
  of columns. The columns are always present in the data model,
  although individual columns may be hidden in the presentation.</p>

  <p>Each row can have child rows. Child rows may be hidden or
  shown, by closing or opening (respectively) the parent row.</p>

  <p>Rows are referred to by the path along the tree that one would
  take to reach the row, using zero-based indices. Thus, the first row
  of a list is row "0", the second row is row "1"; the first child row
  of the first row is row "0,0", the second child row of the first row
  is row "0,1"; the fourth child of the seventh child of the third
  child of the tenth row is "9,2,6,3", etc.</p>

  <p>The columns can have captions. Those captions are not considered
  a row in their own right, they are obtained separately.</p>

  <p>Selection of data in a <code>datagrid</code> operates at the row
  level. If the <code title="attr-datagrid-multiple">multiple</code>
  attribute is present, multiple rows can be selected at once,
  otherwise the user can only select one row at a time.</p>

  <p>The <code>datagrid</code> element can be disabled entirely by
  setting the <code title="attr-datagrid-disabled">disabled</code>
  attribute.</p>
<!--XXXDND
  <p class="big-issue">selection draggable [normative definitions are
  in the interactive part below]</p>
-->

  <p>Columns, rows, and cells can each have specific flags, known as
  classes, applied to them by the data provider. These classes <a
  href="#datagridClassSummary">affect the functionality</a> of the
  <code>datagrid</code> element, and are also <a
  href="#datagridPseudos">passed to the style system</a>. They are
  similar in concept to the <code title="attr-class">class</code>
  attribute, except that they are not specified on elements but are
  given by scripted data providers.</p> <!-- XXX check xrefs -->


  <h5>How rows are identified</h5>

  <p>The chains of numbers that give a row's path, or identifier, are
  represented by objects that implement the
  <span>RowSpecification</span> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>RowSpecification</dfn> {
  // binding-specific interface
};</pre>

  <p>In ECMAScript, two classes of objects are said to implement this
  interface: Numbers representing non-negative integers, and
  homogeneous arrays of Numbers representing non-negative
  integers. Thus, <code>[1,0,9]</code> is a
  <span>RowSpecification</span>, as is <code>1</code> on its
  own. However, <code>[1,0.2,9]</code> is not a
  <span>RowSpecification</span> object, since its second value is not
  an integer.</p>

  <p>User agents must always represent <span>RowSpecification</span>s
  in ECMAScript by using arrays, even if the path only has one
  number.</p>

  <p>The root of the tree is represented by the empty path; in
  ECMAScript, this is the empty array (<code>[]</code>). Only the
  <code title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> and
  <code
  title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">GetChildAtPosition()</code>
  methods ever get called with the empty path.</p>


  <h5>The data provider interface</h5>

  <p><em>The conformance criteria in this section apply to any
  implementation of the <code>DataGridDataProvider</code>, including
  (and most commonly) the content author's implementation(s).</em></p>

  <p>The <code>DataGridDataProvider</code> interface represents the
  interface that objects must implement to be used as custom data
  views for <code>datagrid</code> elements.</p>

  <p>Not all the methods are required. The minimum number of methods
  that must be implemented in a useful view is two: the <code
  title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> and <code
  title="dom-provider-getCellData">getCellData()</code> methods.</p>

  <p>Once the object is written, it must be hooked up to the
  <code>datagrid</code> using the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-data"><code>data</code></dfn> DOM attribute.</p>

  <p>The following methods may be usefully implemented:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-initialize"><code>initialize(<var title="">datagrid</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Called by the <code>datagrid</code> element (the one given by
   the <var title="">datagrid</var> argument) after it has first
   populated itself. This would typically be used to set the initial
   selection of the <code>datagrid</code> element when it is first
   loaded. The data provider could also use this method call to
   register a <code title="event-select">select</code> event handler
   on the <code>datagrid</code> in order to monitor selection
   changes.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getRowCount"><code>getRowCount(<var title="">row</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return the number of rows that are children of the
   specified <var title="">row</var>, including rows that are
   off-screen. If <var title="">row</var> is empty, then the number of
   rows at the top level must be returned. If the value that this
   method would return for a given <var title="">row</var> changes,
   the relevant update methods on the <code>datagrid</code> must be
   called first. Otherwise, this method must always return the same
   number. For a list (as opposed to a tree), this method must return
   0 whenever it is called with a <var title="">row</var> identifier
   that is not empty.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition"><code>getChildAtPosition(<var title="">parentRow</var>, <var title="">position</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return the index of the row that is a child of <var
   title="">parentRow</var> and that is to be positioned as the <var
   title="">position</var>th row under <var title="">parentRow</var>
   when rendering the children of <var title="">parentRow</var>. If
   <var title="">parentRow</var> is empty, then <var
   title="">position</var> refers to the <var
   title="">position</var>th row at the top level of the data
   grid. May be omitted if the rows are always to be sorted in the
   natural order. (The natural order is the one where the method
   always returns <var title="">position</var>.) For a given <var
   title="">parentRow</var>, this method must never return the same
   value for different values of <var title="">position</var>. The
   returned value <var title="">x</var> must be in the range
   0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var title="">x</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var
   title="">n</var>, where <var title="">n</var> is the value returned
   by <code title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount(<var
   title="">parentRow</var>)</code>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getColumnCount"><code>getColumnCount()</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return the number of columns currently in the data model
   (including columns that might be hidden). May be omitted if there
   is only one column. If the value that this method would return
   changes, the <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
   title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything">updateEverything()</code>
   method must be called.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getCaptionText"><code>getCaptionText(<var title="">column</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return the caption, or label, for column <var
   title="">column</var>. May be omitted if the columns have no
   captions. If the value that this method would return changes, the
   <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
   title="dom-datagrid-updateColumnChanged">updateColumnChanged()</code>
   method must be called with the appropriate column index.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getCaptionClasses"><code>getCaptionClasses(<var title="">column</var>, <var title="">classes</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must add the classes that apply to column <var
   title="">column</var> to the <var title="">classes</var> object.
   May be omitted if the columns have no special classes. If the
   classes that this method would add changes, the
   <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
   title="dom-datagrid-updateColumnChanged">updateColumnChanged()</code>
   method must be called with the appropriate column index. Some
   classes have <a href="#datagridClassSummary">predefined
   meanings</a>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getRowImage"><code>getRowImage(<var title="">row</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return a URI to an image that represents row <var
   title="">row</var>, or the empty string if there is no applicable
   image. May be omitted if no rows have associated images. If the
   value that this method would return changes, the
   <code>datagrid</code>'s update methods must be called to update the
   row in question.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getRowMenu"><code>getRowMenu(<var title="">row</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return an <code>HTMLMenuElement</code> object that is to
   be used as a context menu for row <var title="">row</var>, or null
   if there is no particular context menu. May be omitted if none of
   the rows have a special context menu. As this method is called
   immediately before showing the menu in question, no precautions
   need to be taken if the return value of this method changes.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getRowClasses"><code>getRowClasses(<var title="">row</var>, <var title="">classes</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must add the classes that apply to row <var title="">row</var>
   to the <var title="">classes</var> object. May be omitted if the
   rows have no special classes. If the classes that this method would
   add changes, the <code>datagrid</code>'s update methods must be
   called to update the row in question. Some classes have <a
   href="#datagridClassSummary">predefined meanings</a>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getCellData"><code>getCellData(<var title="">row</var>, <var title="">column</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return the value of the cell on row <var
   title="">row</var> in column <var title="">column</var>. For text
   cells, this must be the text to show for that cell. For <span
   title="datagrid-cell-class-progress">progress bar cells</span>,
   this must be either a floating point number in the range 0.0 to 1.0
   (converted to a string representation<!-- XXX this isn't
   technically enough to define what the author must be doing here,
   but let's let that slide until someone notices -->), indicating the
   fraction of the progress bar to show as full (1.0 meaning
   complete), or the empty string, indicating an indeterminate
   progress bar. If the value that this method would return changes,
   the <code>datagrid</code>'s update methods must be called to update
   the rows that changed. If only one cell changed, the <code
   title="dom-datagrid-updateCellChanged">updateCellChanged()</code>
   method may be used.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getCellClasses"><code>getCellClasses(<var title="">row</var>, <var title="">column</var>, <var title="">classes</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must add the classes that apply to the cell on row <var
   title="">row</var> in column <var title="">column</var> to the <var
   title="">classes</var> object. May be omitted if the cells have no
   special classes. If the classes that this method would add changes,
   the <code>datagrid</code>'s update methods must be called to update
   the rows or cells in question. Some classes have <a
   href="#datagridClassSummary">predefined meanings</a>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-toggleColumnSortState"><code>toggleColumnSortState(<var title="">column</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Called by the <code>datagrid</code> when the user tries to sort
   the data using a particular column <var title="">column</var>. The
   data provider must update its state so that the <code
   title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">GetChildAtPosition()</code>
   method returns the new order, and the classes of the columns
   returned by <code
   title="dom-provider-getCaptionClasses">getCaptionClasses()</code>
   represent the new sort status. There is no need to tell the
   <code>datagrid</code> that it the data has changed, as the
   <code>datagrid</code> automatically assumes that the entire data
   model will need updating.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-setCellCheckedState"><code>setCellCheckedState(<var title="">row</var>, <var title="">column</var>, <var title="">state</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Called by the <code>datagrid</code> when the user changes the
   state of a checkbox cell on row <var title="">row</var>, column
   <var title="">column</var>. The checkbox should be toggled to the
   state given by <var title="">state</var>, which is a positive
   integer (1) if the checkbox is to be checked, zero (0) if it is to
   be unchecked, and a negative number (-1) if it is to be set to the
   indeterminate state. There is no need to tell the
   <code>datagrid</code> that the cell has changed, as the
   <code>datagrid</code> automatically assumes that the given cell
   will need updating.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-cycleCell"><code>cycleCell(<var title="">row</var>, <var title="">column</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Called by the <code>datagrid</code> when the user changes the
   state of a cyclable cell on row <var title="">row</var>, column
   <var title="">column</var>. The data provider should change the
   state of the cell to the new state, as appropriate. There is no
   need to tell the <code>datagrid</code> that the cell has
   changed, as the <code>datagrid</code> automatically assumes that
   the given cell will need updating.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-editCell"><code>editCell(<var title="">row</var>, <var title="">column</var>, <var title="">data</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Called by the <code>datagrid</code> when the user edits the
   cell on row <var title="">row</var>, column <var
   title="">column</var>. The new value of the cell is given by <var
   title="">data</var>. The data provider should update the cell
   accordingly. There is no need to tell the <code>datagrid</code>

  <h5>The default data provider</h5>

  <p>The user agent must supply a default data provider for the case
  where the <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
  title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> attribute is null. It must act
  as described in this section.</p>

  <p>The behaviour of the default data provider depends on the nature
  of the first element child of the <code>datagrid</code>.</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>While the first element child is a <code>table</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount(<var title="">row</var>)</code></strong>:
    The number of rows returned by the default data provider for the
    root of the tree (when <var title="">row</var> is empty) must be the total number of <code>tr</code> elements
    that are children of <code>tbody</code> elements that are children
    of the <code>table</code>, if there are any such child
    <code>tbody</code> elements. If there are no such
    <code>tbody</code> elements then the number of rows returned for
    the root must be the number of <code>tr</code> elements that are
    children of the <code>table</code>.</p>

    <p>When <var title="">row</var> is not empty, the number of rows
    returned must be zero.</p>

    <p class="note">The <code>table</code>-based default data provider
    cannot represent a tree.</p>

    <p class="note">Rows in <code>thead</code> elements do not
    contribute to the number of rows returned, although they do affect
    the columns and column captions. Rows in <code>tfoot</code>
    elements are <span title="ignore">ignored</span> completely by
    this algorithm.</p>

    <p id="defaultDataProviderTableMapper"><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">getChildAtPosition(<var
    title="">row</var>, <var title="">i</var>)</code></strong>: The

    <a href="#defaultDataProviderTableSort">current sort
    order</a>.</p>

    <p><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-getColumnCount">getColumnCount()</code></strong>:
    The number of columns returned must be the number of
    <code>td</code> element children in the first <code>tr</code>
    element child of the first <code>tbody</code> element child of the
    <code>table</code>, if there are any such <code>tbody</code>
    elements. If there are no such <code>tbody</code> elements, then
    it must be the number of <code>td</code> element children in the
    first <code>tr</code> element child of the <code>table</code>, if
    any, or otherwise 1. If the number that would be returned by these
    rules is 0, then 1 must be returned instead.</p>

    <p><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-getCaptionText">getCaptionText(<var

    no <code>thead</code> element child, or if its first

    child, the default data provider must return the empty string for
    all captions. Otherwise, the value of the <code>textContent</code>
    attribute of the <var title="">i</var>th <code>th</code> element
    child of the first <code>tr</code> element child of the first
    <code>thead</code> element child of the <code>table</code> element
    must be returned. If there is no such <code>th</code> element, the
    empty string must be returned.</p>

    <p><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-getCaptionClasses">getCaptionClasses(<var

    the <code>table</code> has no <code>thead</code> element child, or
    if its first <code>thead</code> element child has no
    <code>tr</code> element child, the default data provider must not
    add any classes for any of the captions. Otherwise, each class

    title="">i</var>th <code>th</code> element child of the first
    <code>tr</code> element child of the first <code>thead</code>
    element child of the <code>table</code> element must be added to
    the <var title="">classes</var>. If there is no such
    <code>th</code> element, no classes must be added. The user agent
    must then:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>Remove the <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-sorted">sorted</code> and <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-reversed">reversed</code>
     classes.</li>

     <li>If the <code>table</code> element has a <code
     title="attr-class">class</code> attribute that includes the <code
     title="">sortable</code> class, add the <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-sortable">sortable</code>
     class.</li>

     <li>If the column is the one currently being used to
     sort the data, add the <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-sorted">sorted</code> class.</li>

     <li>If the column is the one currently being used to sort the
     data, and it is sorted in descending order, add the <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-reversed">reversed</code> class as
     well.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>The various row- and cell- related methods operate relative to
    a particular element, the element of the row or cell specified by
    their arguments.</p>

    <p><strong>For rows</strong>: Since the default data provider for
    a <code>table</code> always returns 0 as the number of children
    for any row other than the root, the path to the row passed to
    these methods will always consist of a single number. In the prose
    below, this number is referred to as <var title="">i</var>.</p>

    <p>If the <code>table</code> has <code>tbody</code> element
    children, the element for the <var title="">i</var>th row is the
    <var title="">i</var>th <code>tr</code> element that is a child of
    a <code>tbody</code> element that is a child of the
    <code>table</code> element. If the <code>table</code> does not
    have <code>tbody</code> element children, then the element for the
    <var title="">i</var>th real row is the <var title="">i</var>th
    <code>tr</code> element that is a child of the <code>table</code>
    element.</p>

    <p><strong>For cells</strong>: Given a row and its element, the
    row's <var title="">i</var>th cell's element is the <var
    title="">i</var>th <code>td</code> element child of the row
    element.</p>

    <p class="note">The <code>colspan</code> and <code>rowspan</code>
    attributes are <span title="ignore">ignored</span> by this
    algorithm.</p>

    <p><strong><code title="dom-provider-getRowImage">getRowImage(<var
    title="">i</var>)</code></strong>: If the row's first cell's
    element has an <code>img</code> element child, then the URI of the
    row's image is the URI of the first <code>img</code> element child
    of the row's first cell's element. Otherwise, the URI of the row's
    image is the empty string.</p><!-- XXX well. that sentence could
    have gone better, that's for sure. -->

    <p><strong><code title="dom-provider-getRowMenu">getRowMenu(<var
    title="">i</var>)</code></strong>: If the row's first cell's
    element has a <code>menu</code> element child, then the row's menu
    is the first <code>menu</code> element child of the row's first
    cell's element. Otherwise, the row has no menu.</p>

    <p><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-getRowClasses">getRowClasses(<var
    title="">i</var>, <var title="">classes</var>)</code></strong>:
    The default data provider must never add a class to the row's
    classes.</p>

    <p id="defaultDataProviderTableSort"><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-toggleColumnSortState">toggleColumnSortState(<var
    title="">i</var>)</code></strong>: If the data is already being
    sorted on the given column, then the user agent must change the
    current sort mapping to be the inverse of the current sort
    mapping; if the sort order was ascending before, it is now
    descending, otherwise it is now ascending. Otherwise, if the
    current sort column is another column, or the data model is
    currently not sorted, the user agent must create a new mapping,
    which maps rows in the data model to rows in the DOM so that the
    rows in the data model are sorted by the specified column, in
    ascending order. (Which sort comparison operator to use is left up
    to the UA to decide.)</p>

    <p>When the sort mapping is changed, the values returned by the
    <code
    title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">getChildAtPosition()</code>
    method for the default data provider <a
    href="#defaultDataProviderTableMapper">will change
    appropriately</a>.</p>

    <p>The data provider must call the <code>datagrid</code>'s update
    methods appropriately whenever the descendants of the

    removed, then the <code

    methods would probably need to be invoked, and any change to a
    cell or its descendants must cause the cell to be updated. If the
    <code>table</code> element stops being the first child of the
    <code>datagrid</code>, then the data provider must call the <code
    title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything">updateEverything()</code>
    method on the <code>datagrid</code>. Any change to a cell that is
    in the column that the data provider is currently using as its
    sort column must also cause the sort to be reperformed, with a
    call to <code
    title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything">updateEverything()</code> if
    the change did affect the sort order.</p>

    <p>For the rows, assume the existence of a node filter view of the

    any descendents of any <code>option</code> elements.</p>

    <p>Given a path <var title="">row</var>, the corresponding element
    is the one obtained by drilling into the view, taking the child
    given by the path each time.</p>

  <h5>Populating the <code>datagrid</code> element</h5>

  <p>A <code>datagrid</code> must be disabled until its end tag has
  been parsed (in the case of a <code>datagrid</code> element in the
  original document markup) or until it has been inserted into the
  document (in the case of a dynamically created element). After that
  point, the element must fire a single <code
  title="event-load">load</code> event at itself, which doesn't bubble
  and cannot be canceled.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">The end-tag parsing thing should be moved to
  the parsing section.</p>

  <p>The <code>datagrid</code> must then populate itself using the
  data provided by the data provider assigned to the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> DOM attribute. After the view
  is populated (using the methods described below), the
  <code>datagrid</code> must invoke the <code
  title="dom-provider-initialize">initialize()</code> method on the
  data provider specified by the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> attribute, passing itself (the
  <code>HTMLDataGridElement</code> object) as the only argument.</p>

  <p>When the <code title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> attribute is
  null, the <code>datagrid</code> must use the default data provider
  described in the previous section.</p>

  <p>To obtain data from the data provider, the element must invoke
  methods on the data provider object in the following ways:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>To determine the total number of columns</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getColumnCount">getColumnCount()</code> method
   with no arguments. The return value is the number of columns. If
   the return value is zero or negative, not an integer, or simply not
   a numeric type, or if the method is not defined, then 1 must be
   used instead.</dd>

   <dt>To get the captions to use for the columns</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getCaptionText">getCaptionText()</code> method
   with the index of the column in question. The index <var
   title="">i</var> must be in the range 0 &le; <var title="">i</var>
   &lt; <var title="">N</var>, where <var title="">N</var> is the
   total number of columns. The return value is the string to use when
   referring to that column. If the method returns null or the empty
   string, the column has no caption. If the method is not defined,
   then none of the columns have any captions.</dd>

   <dt>To establish what classes apply to a column</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getCaptionClasses">getCaptionClasses()</code>
   method with the index of the column in question, and an object
   implementing the <code>DOMTokenString</code> interface, initialised
   to empty. The index <var title="">i</var> must be in the range 0
   &le; <var title="">i</var> &lt; <var title="">N</var>, where <var
   title="">N</var> is the total number of columns. The values
   contained in the <code>DOMTokenString</code> object when the method
   returns represent the classes that apply to the given column. If
   the method is not defined, no classes apply to the column.</dd>

   <dt>To establish whether a column should be initially included in
   the visible columns</dt>

   <dd>Check whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-initially-hidden">initially-hidden</code>
   class applies to the column. If it does, then the column should not
   be initially included; if it does not, then the column should be
   initially included.</dd>

   <dt id="columnType2">To establish whether the data can be sorted
   relative to a particular column</dt>

   <dd>Check whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-sortable">sortable</code> class
   applies to the column. If it does, then the user should be able to
   ask the UA to display the data sorted by that column; if it does
   not, then the user agent must not allow the user to ask for the
   data to be sorted by that column.</dd>

   <dt>To establish if a column is a sorted column</dt>

   <dd>If the user agent can handle multiple columns being marked as
   sorted simultaneously: Check whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-sorted">sorted</code> class applies to
   the column. If it does, then that column is the sorted column,
   otherwise it is not.</dd>

   <dd>If the user agent can only handle one column being marked as
   sorted at a time: Check each column in turn, starting with the
   first one, to see whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-sorted">sorted</code> class applies to
   that column. The first column that has that class, if any, is the
   sorted column. If none of the columns have that class, there is no
   sorted column.</dd>

   <dt>To establish the sort direction of a sorted column</dt>

   <dd>Check whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-reversed">reversed</code> class
   applies to the column. If it does, then the sort direction is
   descending (down; first rows have the highest values), otherwise it
   is ascending (up; first rows have the lowest values).</dd>

   <dt>To determine the total number of rows</dt>

   <dd>Determine the number of rows for the root of the data grid, and
   determine the number of child rows for each open row. The total
   number of rows is the sum of all these numbers.</dd>

   <dt>To determine the number of rows for the root of the data grid</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> method with a
   <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing the empty path as
   its only argument. The return value is the number of rows at the
   top level of the data grid. If the return value of the method is
   negative, not an integer, or simply not a numeric type, or if the
   method is not defined, then zero must be used instead.</dd>

   <dt>To determine the number of child rows for a row</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> method with a
   <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing the path to the
   row in question. The return value is the number of child rows for
   the given row. If the return value of the method is negative, not
   an integer, or simply not a numeric type, or if the method is not
   defined, then zero must be used instead.</dd>

   <dt>To determine what order to render rows in</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Invoke the <code

    method with a <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing
    the path to the parent of the rows that are being rendered as the
    first argument, and the position that is being rendered as the
    second argument. The return value is the index of the row to
    render in that position.</p>

    <p>If the return value of the method is negative, larger than the
    number of rows that the <code
    title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> method
    reported for that parent, not an integer, or simply not a numeric
    type, then the entire data grid should be disabled. Similarly, if
    the method returns the same value for two or more different values
    for the second argument (with the same first argument, and
    assuming that the data grid hasn't had relevant update methods
    invoked in the meantime), then the data grid should be
    disabled. Instead of disabling the data grid, the user agent may
    act as if the <code
    title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">getChildAtPosition()</code>
    method was not defined on the data provider (thus disabling
    sorting for that data grid, but still letting the user interact
    with the data). If the method is not defined, then the return
    value must be assumed to be the same as the second argument (an
    indentity transform; the data is rendered in its natural
    order).</p>

   is that the former is not an item that can be actually selected,
   whereas the second can be selected and thus has a context menu that

  <p>If the data provider ever raises an exception while the

  <code>datagrid</code> must act, for the purposes of that particular
  method call, as if the relevant method had not been defined.</p>

  <p>A <code>RowSpecification</code> object <var title="">p</var> with

  where <var title="">m</var> is the value that was last returned by

  <p id="inconsistentDataProvider">The data model is considered
  stable: user agents may assume that subsequent calls to the data
  provider methods will return the same data, until one of the update
  methods is called on the <code>datagrid</code> element. If a user
  agent is returned inconsistent data, for example if the number of
  rows returned by <code
  title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> varies in ways
  that do not match the calls made to the update methods, the user
  agent may disable the <code>datagrid</code>. User agents that do not
  disable the <code>datagrid</code> in inconsistent cases must honour

  <p>User agents may cache returned values so that the data provider

  <p>The exact algorithm used to populate the data grid is not defined

  the behaviour of user agents must be consistent with the

  the descriptions above state that cells that have a checkbox cannot

  limitation? -->


  <h5>Updating the <code>datagrid</code></h5>

  <p>Whenever the <code title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code>
  attribute is set to a new value, the <code>datagrid</code> must
  clear the current selection, remove all the displayed rows, and plan
  to repopulate itself using the information from the new data
  provider at the earliest opportunity.</p>

  <p>There are a number of update methods that can be invoked on the
  <code>datagrid</code> element to cause it to refresh itself in
  slightly less drastic ways:</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything"><code>updateEverything()</code></dfn>
  method is called, the user agent must repopulate the entire
  <code>datagrid</code>. If the number of rows decreased, the
  selection must be updated appropriately. If the number of rows
  increased, the new rows should be left unselected.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsChanged"><code>updateRowsChanged(<var
  title="">row</var>, <var title="">count</var>)</code></dfn> method
  is called, the user agent must refresh the rendering of the rows
  starting from the row specified by <var title="">row</var>, and
  including the <var title="">count</var> next siblings of the row (or
  as many next siblings as it has, if that is less than <var
  title="">count</var>), including all descendant rows.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsInserted"><code>updateRowsInserted(<var
  title="">row</var>, <var title="">count</var>)</code></dfn> method
  is called, the user agent must assume that <var title="">count</var>
  new rows have been inserted, such that the first new row is
  indentified by <var title="">row</var>. The user agent must update
  its rendering and the selection accordingly. The new rows should not
  be selected.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsRemoved"><code>updateRowsRemoved(<var
  title="">row</var>, <var title="">count</var>)</code></dfn> method
  is called, the user agent must assume that <var title="">count</var>
  rows have been removed starting from the row that used to be
  identifier by <var title="">row</var>.  The user agent must update
  its rendering and the selection accordingly.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowChanged"><code>updateRowChanged(<var
  title="">row</var>)</code></dfn> method must be exactly equivalent
  to calling <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsChanged">updateRowsChanged(<var
  title="">row</var>, 1)</code>.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateColumnChanged"><code>updateColumnChanged(<var
  title="">column</var>)</code></dfn> method is called, the user agent
  must refresh the rendering of the specified column <var
  title="">column</var>, for all rows.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateCellChanged"><code>updateCellChanged(<var
  title="">row</var>, <var title="">column</var>)</code></dfn> method
  is called, the user agent must refresh the rendering of the cell on
  row <var title="">row</var>, in column <var
  title="">column</var>.</p>

  <p>Any effects the update methods have on the
  <code>datagrid</code>'s selection is not considered a change to the
  selection, and must therefore not fire the <code
  title="event-select">select</code> event.</p>

  <p>These update methods should only be called by the data provider,
  or code acting on behalf of the data provider. In particular,
  calling the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsInserted">updateRowsInserted()</code>
  and <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsRemoved">updateRowsRemoved()</code>
  methods without actually inserting or removing rows from the data
  provider is <a href="#inconsistentDataProvider">likely to result in
  inconsistent renderings</a>, and the user agent is likely to disable
  the data grid.</p>


  <h5>Requirements for interactive user agents</h5>

  <p><em>This section only applies to interactive user agents.</em></p>

  <p>If the <code>datagrid</code> element has a <dfn
  title="attr-datagrid-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn>
  attribute, then the user agent must disable the
  <code>datagrid</code>, preventing the user from interacting with it.
  The <code>datagrid</code> element should still continue to update
  itself when the data provider signals changes to the data, though.
  Obviously, conformance requirements stating that
  <code>datagrid</code> elements must react to users in particular
  ways do not apply when one is disabled.</p>

  <p>If <a href="#rowType1">a row is openable</a>, then the user
  should be able to toggle its open/closed state. When a row's
  open/closed state changes, the user agent must update the rendering
  to match the new state.</p>

  <p>If a cell is a cell whose value <a href="#cellType1">can be
  cycled between multiple states</a>, then the user must be able to
  activate the cell to cycle its value. When the user activates this
  "cycling" behaviour of a cell, then the <code>datagrid</code> must
  invoke the data provider's <code
  title="dom-provider-cycleCell">cycleCell()</code> method, with a
  <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing the cell's row as
  the first argument and the cell's column index as the second. The
  <code>datagrid</code> must act as if the <code>datagrid</code>'s
  <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateCellChanged">updateCellChanged()</code>
  method had been invoked with those same arguments immediately before
  the provider's method was invoked.</p>

  <p>When a cell <a href="#cellType2">has a checkbox</a>, the user
  must be able to set the checkbox's state. When the user changes the
  state of a checkbox in such a cell, the <code>datagrid</code> must
  invoke the data provider's <code
  title="dom-provider-setCellCheckedState">setCellCheckedState()</code>
  method, with a <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing the
  cell's row as the first argument, the cell's column index as the
  second, and the checkbox's new state as the third. The state should
  be represented by the number 1 if the new state is checked, 0 if the
  new state is unchecked, and -1 if the new state is indeterminate
  (which must only be possible if the cell has the <code
  title="datagrid-cell-class-indeterminate">indeterminate</code> class
  set). The <code>datagrid</code> must act as if the
  <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateCellChanged">updateCellChanged()</code>
  method had been invoked, specifying the same cell, immediately
  before the provider's method was invoked.</p>

  <p>If a cell <a href="#cellType2">is editable</a>, the user must be
  able to edit the data for that cell, and doing so must cause the
  user agent to invoke the <code
  title="dom-provider-editCell">editCell()</code> method of the data
  provider with three arguments: a <code>RowSpecification</code>
  object representing the cell's row, the cell's column's index, and
  the new text entered by the user. The user agent must act as if the
  <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateCellChanged">updateCellChanged()</code>
  method had been invoked, with the same row and column specified,
  immediately before the provider's method was invoked.</p>

  <!-- XXXPA <p class="big-issue">define actions (performAction(), etc)</p> -->

  <h5>The selection</h5>

  <p><em>This section only applies to interactive user agents. For
  other user agents, the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-selection">selection</code> attribute must
  return null.</em></p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>DataGridSelection</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-count">length</span>;

  void <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-invert">invert</span>();
  void <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-clear">clear</span>();
};</pre>

  <p>Each <code>datagrid</code> element must keep track of which rows
  are currently selected. Initially no rows are selected, but this can
  be changed via the methods described in this section. <!--XXX
  select-provider-selection The default data provider, for instance,
  changes which rows are selected when it is first initialised.--></p>

  <p>The selection of a <code>datagrid</code> is represented by its
  <dfn title="dom-datagrid-selection"><code>selection</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, which must be a <code>DataGridSelection</code> object.</p>

  <p><code>DataGridSelection</code> objects represent the rows in the
  selection. In the selection the rows must be ordered in the natural
  order of the data provider (and not, e.g., the rendered order). Rows
  that are not rendered because one of their ancestors is closed must
  share the same selection state as their nearest rendered
  ancestor. Such rows are not considered part of the selection for the
  purposes of iterating over the selection.</p>

  <p class="note">This selection API doesn't allow for hidden rows to
  be selected because it is trivial to create a data provider that has
  infinite depth, which would then require the selection to be
  infinite if every row, including every hidden row, was selected.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of rows currently present in the
  selection. The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">index</var>th row in the selection. If the argument is out
  of range (less than zero or greater than the number of selected rows
  minus one), then it must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception. <a href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-isSelected"><code>isSelected()</code></dfn>
  method must return the selected state of the row specified by its
  argument. If the specified row exists and is selected, it must
  return true, otherwise it must return false.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-setSelected"><code>setSelected()</code></dfn>
  method takes two arguments, <var title="">row</var> and <var
  title="">selected</var>. When invoked, it must set the selection
  state of row <var title="">row</var> to selected if <var
  title="">selected</var> is true, and unselected if it is false. If
  <var title="">row</var> is not a row in the data grid, the method
  must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception. If the
  specified row is not rendered because one of its ancestors is
  closed, the method must do nothing.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-selectAll"><code>selectAll()</code></dfn>
  method must mark all the rows in the data grid as selected. After a
  call to <code
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-selectAll">selectAll()</code>, the
  <code title="dom-DataGridSelection-length">length</code> attribute
  will return the number of rows in the data grid, not counting
  children of closed rows.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-invert"><code>invert()</code></dfn>
  method must cause all the rows in the selection that were marked as
  selected to now be marked as not selected, and vice versa.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-clear"><code>clear()</code></dfn>
  method must mark all the rows in the data grid to be marked as not
  selected.  After a call to <code
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-clear">clear()</code>, the <code
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-length">length</code> attribute will
  return zero.</p>

  <p>If the <code>datagrid</code> element has a <dfn
  title="attr-datagrid-multiple"><code>multiple</code></dfn>
  attribute, then the user must be able to select any number of rows
  (zero or more). If the attribute is not present, then the user must
  only be able to select a single row at a time, and selecting another
  one must unselect all the other rows.</p>

  <p class="note">This only applies to the user. Scripts can select
  multiple rows even when the <code
  title="attr-datagrid-multiple">multiple</code> attribute is
  absent.</p>

  <p>Whenever the selection of a <code>datagrid</code> changes,
  whether due to the user interacting with the element, or as a result
  of calls to methods of the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-selection">selection</code> object, a <dfn
  title="event-select"><code>select</code></dfn><!-- XXX check if we
  really should be DFNing this here. It's a DOM3 Core event. What's
  our story going to be regarding events and defining them? --> event
  that bubbles but is not cancelable must be fired on the
  <code>datagrid</code> element. If changes are made to the selection
  via calls to the object's methods during the execution of a
  script<!-- XXX should xref to a better explanation -->, then the
  <code title="event-select">select</code> events must be coalesced
  into one, which must then be fired<!--XXX xref again--> when the
  script execution has completed<!-- XXX xref -->.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>DataGridSelection</code> interface has no
  relation to the <code>Selection</code> interface.</p>


  <h5>Columns and captions</h5>

  <p><em>This section only applies to interactive user agents.</em></p>

  <p>Each <code>datagrid</code> element must keep track of which
  columns are currently being rendered. User agents should initially
  show all the columns except those with the <code
  title="datagrid-column-class-initially-hidden">initially-hidden</code>
  class, but may allow users to hide or show columns. User agents
  should initially display the columns in the order given by the data
  provider, but may allow this order to be changed by the user.</p>

  <p>If columns are not being used, as might be the case if the data
  grid is being presented in an icon view, or if an overview of data
  is being read in an aural context, then the text of the first column
  of each row should be used to represent the row.</p>

  <p>If none of the columns have any captions (i.e. if the data
  provider does not provide a <code
  title="dom-provider-getCaptionText">getCaptionText()</code> method),
  then user agents may avoid showing the column headers at all. This
  may prevent the user from performing actions on the columns (such as
  reordering them, changing the sort column, and so on).</p>

  <p class="note">Whatever the order used for rendering, and
  irrespective of what columns are being shown or hidden, the "first
  column" as referred to in this specification is always the column
  with index zero, and the "last column" is always the column with the
  index one less than the value returned by the <code
  title="dom-provider-getcolumnCount">getColumnCount()</code> method
  of the data provider.</p>

  <p>If <a href="#columnType2">a column is sortable</a>, then the user
  must be able to invoke it to sort the data. When the user does so,
  then the <code>datagrid</code> must invoke the data provider's <code
  title="dom-provider-toggleColumnSortState">toggleColumnSortState()</code>
  method, with the column's index as the only argument. The
  <code>datagrid</code> must <em>then</em> act as if the
  <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything">updateEverything()</code>
  method had been invoked.</p>

    <p>The <code title="command-ro">Command</code> interface must also be implemented by
    this element.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>command</code> element represents a command that the user
  can invoke.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-type"><code>type</code></dfn>
  attribute indicates the kind of command: either a normal command
  with an associated action, or a state or option that can be toggled,
  or a selection of one item from a list of items.</p>

  <p>The attribute's value must be either "<code
  title="">command</code>", "<code title="">checkbox</code>", or
  "<code title="">radio</code>", denoting each of these three types of
  commands respectively. The attribute may also be omitted if the
  element is to represent the first of these types, a simple
  command.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-label"><code>label</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the name of the command, as shown to the user.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-title"><code>title</code></dfn>
  attribute gives a hint describing the command, which might be shown
  to the user to help him.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-icon"><code>icon</code></dfn>
  attribute gives a picture that represents the command. If the
  attribute is specified, the attribute's value must contain a
  URI.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-hidden"><code>hidden</code></dfn>
  attribute indicates, if present, that the command is not relevant
  and is to be hidden. If present, the attribute must have the exact
  value <code title="">hidden</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-command-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn> attribute
  indicates, if present, that the command is not available in the
  current state. If present, the attribute must have the exact value
  <code title="">disabled</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">The distinction between <span
  title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled State</span> and <span
  title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span> is subtle. A
  command should be Disabled if, in the same context, it could be
  enabled if only certain aspects of the situation were changed. A
  command should be marked as Hidden if, in that situation, the
  command will never be enabled. For example, in the context menu for
  a water faucet, the command "open" might be Disabled if the faucet
  is already open, but the command "eat" would be marked Hidden since
  the faucet could never be eaten.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-checked"><code>checked</code></dfn>
  attribute indicates, if present, that the command is selected. If
  present, the attribute must have the exact value <code
  title="">checked</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-command-radiogroup"><code>radiogroup</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the name of the group of commands that will be
  toggled when the command itself is toggled, for commands whose <code
  title="attr-command-type">type</code> attribute has the value "<code
  title="">radio</code>". The scope of the name is the child list of
  the parent element.</p>

  <p>If the <code>command</code> element is used when <span
  title="menu generation">generating</span> a <span>context
  menu</span>, then the <dfn
  title="attr-command-default"><code>default</code></dfn> attribute
  indicates, if present, that the command is the one that would have
  been invoked if the user had directly activated the menu's subject
  instead of using its context menu.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p class="big-issue">Need an example that shows an element that, if
   double-clicked, invokes an action, but that also has a context
   menu, showing the various <code>command</code> attributes off, and

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-click"><code>click()</code></dfn>

   value exactly matches the current element's (treating missing <code
   title="attr-command-radiogroup">radiogroup</code> attributes as if
   they were the empty string), and has a <code
   title="attr-command-checked">checked</code> attribute, must remove
   that attribute and <span>fire a <code title="">click</code>

};</pre>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>menu</code> element represents a list of commands.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-menu-type"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute
  indicates the kind of menu. It must have either the value <code
  title="">popup</code> (to declare a context menu) or the value <code
  title="">toolbar</code> (to define a tool bar). The attribute may
  also be omitted, to indicate that the element is merely a list of
  commands that is neither declaring a context menu nor defining a
  tool bar.</p>

  <p>If a <code>menu</code> element has a <code
  title="attr-menu-type">type</code> attribute with the value <code
  title="">popup</code>, then it represents the commands of a context
  menu, and the user can only interact with the commands if that
  context menu is activated.</p>

  <p>If a <code>menu</code> element has a <code
  title="attr-menu-type">type</code> attribute with the value <code
  title="">toolbar</code>, then it represents a list of active
  commands that the user can immediately interact with.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if a <code>menu</code> element has no <code
  title="attr-menu-type">type</code> attribute, or if has a <code
  title="attr-menu-type">type</code> attribute with a value other than
  <code title="">popup</code> or <code title="">toolbar</code>, then
  it either represents an unordered list of items (each represented by
  an <code>li</code> element), each of which represents a command that
  the user may perform or activate, or, if the element has no
  <code>li</code> element children, a <span>paragraph</span>
  describing available commands.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-menu-label"><code>label</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the label of the menu. It is used by user agents to
  display nested menus in the UI. For example, a context menu
  containing another menu would use the nested menu's <code
  title="attr-menu-label">label</code> attribute for the submenu's
  menu label.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-menu-autosubmit"><code>autosubmit</code></dfn> attribute
  indicates whether selections made to form controls in this menu
  should result in the control's form being immediately submitted. If
  the attribute is present, its value must be <code
  title="">autosubmit</code>.</p>

  <p>If a <code title="event-change">change</code> event bubbles
  through a <code>menu</code> element, then, in addition to any other
  default action that that event might have, the UA must act as if the
  following was an additional default action for that event: if (when
  it comes time to execute the default action) the <code>menu</code>
  element has an <code title="attr-menu-autosubmit">autosubmit</code>
  attribute, and the target of the event is an <code>input</code>
  element, and that element has a <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute whose value is either
  <code title="">radio</code> or <code title="">checkbox</code>, and
  the <code>input</code> element in question has a non-null <code
  title="dom-input-form">form</code> DOM attribute, then the UA must
  invoke the <code title="dom-form-submit">submit()</code> method of
  the <code>form</code> element indicated by that DOM attribute.</p>

  <h2 id="processing-models">Processing models</h2>

  <h3>Navigating across documents</h3>

  <p>Web browsers operate on <span title="browsing context">browsing
  contexts</span>, which have a <em>session history</em>.</p>

  <p>Certain actions cause the browsing context to <em>navigate</em>
  to a new document. A new document could be an HTML or XML
  <code>Document</code>, with a DOM, or it could be an image, or some
  other content. The new resource in question could have a URI, or it
  could be anonymous, for example a new document generated using the
  <code title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code>
  API.</p><!-- that is, window.open() followed by document.open()
  followed by document.write(), i guess XXX -->

  <p>In addition, a particular resource can have multiple entries in
  the session history of a browsing context.</p>

  <p>The requirements that the session history concept puts on user
  agents are defined in <a href="#history">the session history and
  navigation section</a>, which is structured around the APIs provided
  for scripts to interact with the session history.</p>

  <p><em>This</em> section discusses the various types of content that
  a user agent may find itself requested to dispay in a content area,
  and covers how those types of content should be handled.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">This section will end up defining what the UA
  should do when the user clicks a link, types a link in the address
  bar, uses a bookmark, etc. This will probably involve being honest
  about the fact that UAs typically content sniff for RSS/Atom feeds
  at this point. It should also reference the <code
  title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler</code>
  and <code
  title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler</code>
  methods and their stuff. Also involves the session history and
  bfcache (there's a separate section on that though).</p>

  <h4>Page load processing model for HTML files</h4>

  <p>When an HTML page<!-- should we say "a resource with a text/html
  MIME type? --> (as opposed to an XML page) is loaded in a
  <span>browsing context</span>, the user agent must begin to parse
  the stream of bytes as described in <a href="#parsing">the parsing
  section</a>.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">create a <code>Document</code> node, mark it as
  being an <span title="HTML documents">HTML document</span>, create
  an <span>HTML parser</span>, associate them together, run the parser
  while pushing bytes into the end of the input stream, push an
  explicit EOF when you have no more bytes, and require the parser to
  wait for an explicit EOF in this case (or some equivalent)</p>

  <p>This will usually eventually cause a <code
  title="event-load">load</code> event to be fired.</p> <!-- XXX continue... -->

  <p class="big-issue">This needs to say that a parser is created,

  <h3>Scripting</h3>

  <div class="big-issue">

   <p>Here are some of the things I think we should list:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>That scripting is single-threaded, or, how to handle
    multithreadedness. By this I mean, the only way to run a script
    while another script is running is to insert a &lt;script> block
    that doesn't have a src="" attribute. If we have multiple threads,
    what does that mean. If we don't, how do we define exactly it is
    that is single-threaded, given multiple windows being open at once
    running scripts on different "real" threads -- where does the
    boundary of what this spec is speccing lie, given that we have to
    define the interaction across window.open() windows, etc.</li>

    <li>onload/onunload events</li>

    <li>alert() blocks scripts, even those on timeouts or
    readystatechange events</li>

   </ul>

   <p>Here are ways of running scripts which we have to make sure we
   have covered:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>&lt;script></li>
    <li>javascript: URIs in things like IFRAMEs, IMGs, FRAMEs, OBJECTs, SCRIPTs, STYLEs, etc.</li>
    <li>CSS javascript:</li>
    <li>XBL</li>
    <li>onload handlers for IMG elements.</li>
    <li>event handlers, including onreadystatechanged, onload, onunload, onclick</li>
    <li>...any others?</li>

   </ul>

  </div>

  <h4><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Runtime script errors</h4>

  <p>Whenever a runtime script error occurs in one of the scripts
  associated with the document, the value of the
  <dfn><code>onerror</code></dfn> attribute of the <code>window</code>
  object (defined on the <code>WindowHTML</code> interface of that
  object), must be processed, as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the value is a function</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The function referenced by the <code>onerror</code> attribute
    must be invoked with three arguments, before notifying the user of
    the error.</p>

    <p>The three arguments passed to the function are all
    <code>DOMString</code>s; the first must give the message that the
    UA is considering reporting, the second must give the URI to the
    resource in which the error occured, and the third must give the
    line number in that resource on which the error occured.</p>

    <p>If the function returns false, then the error should not be
    reported to the user. Otherwise, if the function returns another
    value (or does not return at all), the error should be reported to
    the user.</p>

    <p>Any exceptions thrown or errors caused by this function must be
    reported to the user immediately after the error that the function
    was called for, without calling the function again.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>If the value is <code>null</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The error should not reported to the user.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>If the value is anything else</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The error should be reported to the user.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>The initial value of <code>onerror</code> must be
  <code>undefined</code>.</p>



  <h3><dfn>Headings and sections</dfn></h3>

  <p>The <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> elements and the
  <code>header</code> element are headings.</p>

  <p>The first heading in a sectioning element gives the header for
  that section. Subsequent headers of equal or higher
  <span>rank</span> start new (implied) sections, headers of lower
  <span>rank</span> start subsections that are part of the previous
  one.</p>

  <p>Sectioning elements other than <code>blockquote</code> are always
  considered subsections of their nearest ancestor sectioning element,
  regardless of what implied sections other headings may have created.
  However, <code>blockquote</code> elements <em>are</em> associated
  with implied sections. Effectively, <code>blockquote</code> elements
  act like sections on the inside, and act opaquely on the
  outside.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For the following fragment:</p>
   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;Foo&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;Bar&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Bla&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Baz&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;Quux&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Thud&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Grunt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>
   <p>...the structure would be:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Foo (heading of explicit <code>body</code> section)
     <ol>
      <li>
       Bar (heading starting implied section)
       <ol>
        <li>
         Bla (heading of explicit <code>blockquote</code> section)
        </li>
       </ol>
       Baz (paragraph)
      </li>
      <li>
       Quux (heading starting implied section)
      </li>
      <li>
       Thud (heading of explicit <code>section</code> section)
      </li>
     </ol>
     Grunt (paragraph)
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>Notice how the <code>blockquote</code> nests inside an implicit
   section while the <code>section</code> does not (and in fact, ends
   the earlier implicit section so that a later paragraph is back at
   the top level).</p>
  </div>

  <p>Sections may contain headers of any <span>rank</span>, but
  authors are strongly encouraged to either use only <code>h1</code>
  elements, or to use elements of the appropriate <span>rank</span>
  for the section's nesting level.</p>

  <p>Authors are also encouraged to explictly wrap sections in
  sectioning elements, instead of relying on the implicit sections
  generated by having multiple heading in one sectioning element.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, the following is correct:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Apples&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Apples are fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Taste&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They taste lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h6&gt;Sweet&lt;/h6&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Red apples are sweeter than green ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Colour&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apples come in various colours.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>

   <p>However, the same document would be more clearly expressed
   as:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;Apples&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Apples are fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Taste&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They taste lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;section&gt;
   &lt;h3&gt;Sweet&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Red apples are sweeter than green ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Colour&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apples come in various colours.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>

   <p>Both of the documents above are semantically identical and would
   produce the same outline in compliant user agents.</p>

  </div>

  <h4 id="outlines">Creating an outline</h4>

  <p>Documents can be viewed as a tree of sections, which defines how
  each element in the tree is semantically related to the others, in
  terms of the overall section structure. This tree is related to the
  document tree, but there is not a one-to-one relationship between
  elements in the DOM and the document's sections.</p>

  <p>The tree of sections should be used when generating document
  outlines, for example when generating tables of contents.</p>

  <p>To derive the tree of sections from the document tree, a
  hypothetical tree is used, consisting of a view of the document tree
  containing only the <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> and
  <code>header</code> elements, and the sectioning elements other than
  <code>blockquote</code>. Descendants of
  <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code>, <code>header</code>, and
  <code>blockquote</code> elements must be removed from this view.</p>

  <p>The hypothetical tree must be rooted at the <span>root
  element</span> or at a sectioning element. In particular, while the
  sections inside <code>blockquote</code>s do not contribute to the
  document's tree of sections, <code>blockquote</code>s can have
  outlines of their own.</p>

  <p>UAs must take this hypothetical tree (which will become the
  outline) and mutate it by walking it depth first in <span>tree order</span> and,
  for each <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> or <code>header</code>
  element that is not the first element of its parent sectioning
  element, inserting a new sectioning element, as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the element is a <code>header</code> element, or if it is an
   <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> node of <span>rank</span> equal to
   or higher than the first element in the parent sectioning element
   (assuming that is also an <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> node), or
   if the first element of the parent sectioning element is a
   sectioning element:</dt>

   <dd>Insert the new sectioning element as the immediately following
   sibling of the parent sectioning element, and move all the elements
   from the current heading element up to the end of the parent
   sectioning element into the new sectioning element.</dd>

   <dt>Otherwise:</dt>

   <dd>Move the current heading element, and all subsequent siblings
   up to but excluding the next sectioning element,
   <code>header</code> element, or <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> of
   equal or higher <span>rank</span>, whichever comes first, into the
   new sectioning element, then insert the new sectioning element
   where the current header was.</dd>

  <p>The outline is then the resulting hypothetical tree. The
  <span>rank</span>s of the headers become irrelevant at this point:
  each sectioning element in the hypothetical tree contains either no
  or one heading element child. If there is one, then it gives the
  section's heading, of there isn't, the section has no heading.</p>

  <p>Sections are nested as in the hypothetical tree. If a sectioning
  element is a child of another, that means it is a subsection of that
  other section.</p>

  <p>When creating an interactive table of contents, entries should
  jump the user to the relevant section element, if it was a real
  element in the original document, or to the heading, if the section
  element was one of those created during the above process.</p>

  <p class="example">Selecting the first section of the document
  therefore always takes the user to the top of the document,
  regardless of where the first header in the <code>body</code> is to
  be found.</p> <!-- XXX assuming there is a body, anyway -->

  <h4>Determining which heading and section applies to a particular
  node</h4>

  <p>Given a particular node, user agents must use the following
  algorithm, <em>in the given order</em>, to determine which heading
  and section the node is most closely associated with. The processing
  of this algorithm must stop as soon as the associated section and
  heading are established (even if they are established to be
  nothing).</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the node has an ancestor that is a <code>header</code>
   element, then the associated heading is the most distant such
   ancestor. The associated section is that <code>header</code>'s
   associated section (i.e. repeat this algorithm for that
   <code>header</code>).</li>

   <li>If the node has an ancestor that is an
   <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> element, then the associated
   heading is the most distant such ancestor. The associated section
   is that heading's section (i.e. repeat this algorithm for that
   heading element).</li>

   <li>If the node is an <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> element or a
   <code>header</code> element, then the associated heading is the
   element itself. The UA must then generate the <a
   href="#outlines">hypothetical section tree</a> described in the
   previous section, rooted at the nearest section ancestor (or the
   <span>root element</span> if there is no such ancestor). If the
   parent of the heading in that hypothetical tree is an element in
   the real document tree, then that element is the associated
   section. Otherwise, there is no associated section element.</li>

   <li>If the node is a sectioning element, then the associated
   section is itself. The UA must then generate the <a
   href="#outlines">hypothetical section tree</a> described in the
   previous section, rooted at the section itself. If the section
   element, in that hypothetical tree, has a child element that is an
   <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> element or a <code>header</code>
   element, then that element is the associated heading. Otherwise,
   there is no associated heading element.</li>

   <li>If the node is a <code>footer</code> or <code>address</code>
   element, then the associated section is the nearest ancestor
   sectioning element, if there is one. The node's associated heading
   is the same as that sectioning element's associated heading (i.e.
   repeat this algorithm for that sectioning element). If there is no
   ancestor sectioning element, the element has no associated section
   nor an associated heading.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, the node is just a normal node, and the document has
   to be examined more closely to determine its section and heading.
   Create a view rooted at the nearest ancestor sectioning element (or
   the <span>root element</span> if there is none) that has just
   <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> elements, <code>header</code>
   elements, the node itself, and sectioning elements other than
   <code>blockquote</code> elements. (Descendants of any of the nodes
   in this view can be ignored, as can any node later in the tree than
   the node in question, as the algorithm below merely walks backwards
   up this view.)</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">n</var> be an iterator for this view, initialised at
   the node in question.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">c</var> be the current best candidate heading,
   initially null, and initially not used. It is used when top-level
   heading candidates are to be searched for (see below).</li>

   <li>Repeat these steps (which effectively goes backwards through
   the node's previous siblings) until an answer is found:

    <ol>

     <li>If <var title="">n</var> points to a node with no previous sibling,
     and <var title="">c</var> is null, then return the node's parent node as
     the answer. If the node has no parent node, return null as the
     answer.</li>

     <li>Otherwise, if <var title="">n</var> points to a node with no
     previous sibling, return <var title="">c</var> as the answer.</li>

     <li>Adjust <var title="">n</var> so that it points to the previous sibling
     of the current position.</li>

     <li>If <var title="">n</var> is pointing at an <code>h1</code> or
     <code>header</code> element, then return that element as the
     answer.</li>

     <li>If <var title="">n</var> is pointing at an
     <code>h2</code>-<code>h6</code> element, and heading candidates
     are not being searched for, then return that element as the
     answer.</li>

     <li>Otherwise, if <var title="">n</var> is pointing at an
     <code>h2</code>-<code>h6</code> element, and either <var title="">c</var>
     is still null, or <var title="">c</var> is a heading of lower
     <span>rank</span> than this one, then set <var title="">c</var> to be this
     element, and continue going backwards through the previous
     siblings.</li>

     <li>If <var title="">n</var> is pointing at a sectioning element, then
     from this point on top-level heading candidates are being
     searched for. (Specifically, we are looking for the nearest
     top-level header for the current section.) Continue going
     backwards through the previous siblings.</li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>If the answer from the previous step (the loop) is null, which
   can only happen if the node has no preceeding headings and is not
   contained in a sectioning element, then there is no associated
   heading and no associated section.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the answer from the earlier loop step is a
   sectioning element, then the associated section is that element and
   the associated heading is that sectioning element's associated
   heading (i.e. repeat this algorithm for that section).</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the answer from that same earlier step is an
   <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> element or a <code>header</code>
   element, then the associated heading is that element and the
   associated section is that heading element's associated
   section (i.e. repeat this algorithm for that heading).</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">Not all nodes have an associated header or section.
  For example, if a section is implied, as when multiple headers are
  found in one sectioning element, then a node in that section has an
  anonymous associated section (its section is not represented by a
  real element), and the algorithm above does not associate that node
  with any particular sectioning element.</p>

  <h3 id="commands">Commands</h3>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-command">command</dfn> is the abstraction
  behind menu items, buttons, and links. Once a command is defined,
  other parts of the interface can refer to the same command, allowing
  many access points to a single feature to share aspects such as the
  disabled state.</p>

  <p id="facets">Commands are defined to have the following
  <em>facets</em>:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Type">Type</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The kind of command: "command", meaning it is a normal command;
   "radio", meaning that triggering the command will, amongst other
   things, set the <span title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked
   State</span> to true (and probably uncheck some other commands); or
   "checkbox", meaning that triggering the command will, amongst other
   things, toggle the value of the <span
   title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-ID">ID</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The name of the command, for referring to the command from the
   markup or from script. If a command has no ID, it is an
   <dfn>anonymous command</dfn>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Label">Label</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The name of the command as seen by the user.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</dfn></dt>

   <dd>A helpful or descriptive string that can be shown to the
   user.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</dfn></dt>

   <dd>A graphical image that represents the action.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Whether the command is hidden or not (basically, whether it
   should be shown in menus).</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled State</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Whether the command can be triggered or not. If the <span
   title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span> is true
   (hidden) then the <span
   title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled State</span> will be
   true (disabled) regardless. <span class="issue">We could make this
   into a string value that acts as a Hint for why the command is
   disabled.</span></dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Whether the command is checked or not.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Action">Action</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The actual effect that triggering the command will have. This
   could be a scripted event handler, a URI to which to navigate, or a
   form submission.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Triggers">Triggers</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The list of elements that can trigger the command. The element
   defining a command is always in the list of elements that can
   trigger the command. For anonymous commands, only the element
   defining the command is on the list, since other elements have no
   way to refer to it.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Commands are represented by elements in the DOM. Any element that
  can define a command also implements the <code title="command-ro">Command</code>
  interface:</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn title="command-ro">Command</dfn> {<!--
 NOTE: to avoid clashing with the HTMLCommandElement interface's names,
       the members of this interface use cross-references with the title
       dom-command-ro-foo (note the "ro", which stands for "readonly").
-->
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-command-ro-commandType">commandType</span>;          
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-command-ro-id">id</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-command-ro-label">label</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-command-ro-title">title</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-command-ro-icon">icon</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-command-ro-hidden">hidden</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-command-ro-disabled">disabled</span>;              
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-command-ro-checked">checked</span>;              
  void <span title="dom-command-ro-click">click</span>();
  readonly attribute <span>HTMLCollection</span> <span title="dom-command-ro-triggers">triggers</span>;
  readonly attribute <span>Command</span> <span title="dom-command-ro-command">command</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <code title="command-ro">Command</code> interface is implemented by any element
  capable of defining a command. (If an element can define a command,
  its definition will list this interface explicitly.) All the
  attributes of the <code title="command-ro">Command</code> interface are
  read-only. Elements implementing this interface may implement other
  interfaces that have attributes with identical names but that are
  mutable; in bindings that simply flatten all supported interfaces on
  the object, the mutable attributes must shadow the readonly
  attributes defined in the <code title="command-ro">Command</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-command-ro-commandType"><code>commandType</code></dfn>
  attribute must return a string whose value is either "<code
  title="">command</code>", "<code title="">radio</code>", or "<code
  title="">checked</code>", depending on whether the <span
  title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> of the command defined by the
  element is "command", "radio", or "checked" respectively. If the
  element does not define a command, it must return null.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-id"><code>id</code></dfn> attribute
  must return the command's <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span>,
  or null if the element does not define a command or defines an
  <span>anonymous command</span>. This attribute will be shadowed by
  the <code title="dom-id">id</code> DOM attribute on the
  <code>HTMLElement</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-label"><code>label</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the command's <span
  title="command-facet-Label">Label</span>, or null if the element
  does not define a command or does not specify a <span
  title="command-facet-Label">Label</span>. This attribute will be
  shadowed by the <code title="">label</code> DOM attribute on
  <code>option</code> and <code>command</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-title"><code>title</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the command's <span
  title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span>, or null if the element does
  not define a command or does not specify a <span
  title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span>. This attribute will be
  shadowed by the <code title="dom-title">title</code> DOM attribute
  on the <code>HTMLElement</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-icon"><code>icon</code></dfn>
  attribute must return an absolute URI to the command's <span
  title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span>. If the element does not
  specify an icon, or if the element does not define a command, then
  the attribute must return null. This attribute will be shadowed by
  the <code title="dom-command-icon">icon</code> DOM attribute on
  <code>command</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-hidden"><code>hidden</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if the command's <span
  title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span> is that the
  command is hidden, and false if it is that the command is not
  hidden. If the element does not define a command, the attribute must
  return false. This attribute will be shadowed by the <code
  title="dom-command-hidden">hidden</code> DOM attribute on
  <code>command</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-command-ro-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if the command's <span
  title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled State</span> is that
  the command is disabled, and false if the command is not
  disabled. This attribute is not affected by the command's <span
  title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span>. If the
  element does not define a command, the attribute must return
  false. This attribute will be shadowed by the <code
  title="">disabled</code> attribute on <code>button</code>,
  <code>input</code>, <code>option</code>, and <code>command</code>
  elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-command-ro-checked"><code>checked</code></dfn> attribute
  must return true if the command's <span
  title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span> is that the
  command is checked, and false if it is that the command is not
  checked. If the element does not define a command, the attribute
  must return false. This attribute will be shadowed by the <code
  title="">checked</code> attribute on <code>input</code> and
  <code>command</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-click"><code>click()</code></dfn>
  method must trigger the <span
  title="command-facet-Action">Action</span> for the command. If the
  element does not define a command, this method must do nothing. This
  method will be shadowed by the <code title="">click()</code> method
  on <code>button</code>, <code>input</code>, and <code>command</code>
  elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-command-ro-triggers"><code>triggers</code></dfn>
  attribute must return a list containing the elements that can
  trigger the command (the command's <span
  title="command-facet-Triggers">Triggers</span>). The list must be
  <span>live</span>. While the element does not define a command, the
  list must be empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-commands"><code>commands</code></dfn> attribute
  of the document's <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface must return an
  <code>HTMLCollection</code> rooted at the <code>Document</code>
  node, whose filter matches only elements that define commands and
  have IDs. (The same instance of the <code>HTMLCollection</code>
  object must be returned each time.)</p>

  <p>The following elements can define commands: <code
  title="a-command">a</code>, <code
  title="button-command">button</code>, <code
  title="input-command">input</code>, <code
  title="option-command">option</code>, <code
  title="command-element">command</code>.</p>


  <h4><dfn title="a-command">Using the <code>a</code> element to define a command</dfn></h4>

  <p>An <code>a</code> element with an <code
  title="attr-a-href">href</code> attribute <span
  title="concept-command">defines a command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> of the command
  is "command".</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span> of the command is
  the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute of the
  element, if the attribute is present and not empty. Otherwise the
  command is an <span>anonymous command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> of the command
  is the string given by the element's <code>textContent</code> DOM
  attribute.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> of the command
  is the value of the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute
  of the <code>a</code> element. If the attribute is not present, the
  <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> is the empty
  string.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span> of the command
  is the absolute URI of the first image in the element. Specifically,
  in a depth-first search of the children of the element, the first
  element that is <!--either an--> <code>img</code> element with a
  <code>src</code> attribute<!--, or an <code>object</code> element
  with a <code>data</code> attribute, or, if the UA supports SVG, an
  <code>svg</code> element in the SVG namespace with a valid <code
  title="">id</code> attribute,--> is the one that is used as the
  image. <!--If it is an <code>img</code> element then--> The URI must
  be taken from the element's <code>src</code> attribute. <!--If it is
  an <code>object</code> element then the URI is taken from the
  <code>data</code> attribute. --> Relative URIs must be resolved
  relative to the base URI of the image element. <!-- If it is an
  <code>svg</code> element then the URI is formed by taking the URI of
  the document and appending a "#" (U+0023 NUMBER SIGN) and the ID of
  the element.--> If no image is found, then the Icon facet is left
  blank.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span>
  and <span title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled State</span>
  facets of the command are always false. (The command is always
  enabled.)</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span>
  of the command is always false. (The command is never checked.)</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Action">Action</span> of the
  command is to <span title="fire a click event">fire a <code
  title="">click</code> event</span> at the element.</p>


  <h4><dfn title="button-command">Using the <code>button</code> element to define a command</dfn></h4>

  <p>A <code>button</code> element always <span
  title="concept-command">defines a command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span>, <span
  title="command-facet-ID">ID</span>, <span
  title="command-facet-Label">Label</span>, <span
  title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span>, <span
  title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span>, <span
  title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span>, <span
  title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span>, and <span
  title="command-facet-Action">Action</span> facets of the command are
  determined <span title="a-command">as for <code>a</code>
  elements</span> (see the previous section).</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled
  State</span> of the command mirrors the disabled state of the
  button. Typically this is given by the element's <code
  title="attr-button-disabled">disabled</code> attribute, but certain
  button types become disabled at other times too (for example, the
  <code>move-up</code> button type is disabled when it would have no
  effect).</p>


  <h4><dfn title="input-command">Using the <code>input</code> element to define a command</dfn></h4>

  <p>An <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is one of
  <code>submit</code>, <code>reset</code>, <code>button</code>,
  <code>radio</code>, <code>checkbox</code>, <code>move-up</code>,
  <code>move-down</code>, <code>add</code>, and <code>remove</code>
  <span title="concept-command">defines a command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> of the command
  is "radio" if the <code title="attr-input-type">type</code>
  attribute has the value <code>radio</code>, "checkbox" if the
  <code>type</code> attribute has the value <code>checkbox</code>, and
  "command" otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span> of the command is
  the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute of the
  element, if the attribute is present and not empty. Otherwise the
  command is an <span>anonymous command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> of the command
  depends on the Type of the command:</p>

  <p>If the <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> is "command",
  then it is the string given by the <code
  title="attr-input-value">value</code> attribute, if any, and a
  <span>UA-dependent value</span><!-- XXX xref--> that the UA uses to
  label the button itself if the attribute is absent.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> is
  "radio" or "checkbox". If the element has a <code>label</code>
  element associated with it, the <code>textContent</code> of the
  first such element is the <span
  title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> (in DOM terms, this the
  string given by
  <code><var title="">element</var>.labels[0].textContent</code>).  Otherwise,
  the value of the <code>value</code> attribute, if present, is the
  <span title="command-facet-Label">Label</span>. Otherwise, the <span
  title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> is the empty string.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> of the command
  is the value of the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute
  of the <code>input</code> element. If the attribute is not present, the
  <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> is the empty
  string.</p>

  <p>There is no <span title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span> for the
  command.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span>
  of the command is always false. (The command is never hidden.)</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled
  State</span> of the command mirrors the disabled state of the
  control. Typically this is given by the element's <code
  title="attr-input-disabled">disabled</code> attribute, but certain
  input types become disabled at other times too (for example, the
  <code>move-up</code> input type is disabled when it would have no
  effect).</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span>
  of the command is true if the command is of <span
  title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> "radio" or "checkbox" and the
  element has a <code title="attr-input-checked">checked</code>
  attribute, and false otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Action">Action</span> of the
  command is to <span title="fire a click event">fire a <code

  is probably wrong for radio and checkbox types, depending on how we

  <h4><dfn title="option-command">Using the <code>option</code> element to define a command</dfn></h4>

  <p>An <code>option</code> element with an ancestor
  <code>select</code> element and either no <code>value</code>
  attribute or a <code>value</code> attribute that is not the empty
  string <span title="concept-command">defines a command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> of the command
  is "radio" if the <code>option</code>'s nearest ancestor
  <code>select</code> element has no <code
  title="attr-select-multiple">multiple</code> attribute, and
  "checkbox" if it does.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span> of the command is
  the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute of the
  element, if the attribute is present and not empty. Otherwise the
  command is an <span>anonymous command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> of the command
  is the value of the <code>option</code> element's <code
  title="attr-option-label">label</code> attribute, if there is one,
  or the value of the <code>option</code> element's
  <code>textContent</code> DOM attribute if it doesn't.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> of the command
  is the string given by the element's <code

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span>
  of the command is always false. (The command is never hidden.)</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span>
  of the command is true (checked) if the element's <code
  title="dom-option-selected">selected</code> DOM attribute is true,
  and false otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Action">Action</span> of the
  command depends on its <span
  title="command-facet-Type">Type</span>. If the command is of <span
  title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> "radio" then this must set
  the <code title="dom-option-selected">selected</code> DOM attribute
  of the <code>option</code> element to true, otherwise it must toggle
  the state of the <code title="dom-option-selected">selected</code>
  DOM attribute (set it to true if it is false and vice versa). Then
  <span title="fire a change event">a <code title="">change</code>
  event must be fired</span> on the <code>option</code> element's
  nearest ancestor <code>select</code> element (if there is one), as
  if the selection had been changed directly.</p>


  <h4>Using the <dfn

  "<code>radio</code>", "checkbox" if the attribute's value is
  "<code>checkbox</code>", and "command" otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span> of the command is
  the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute of the
  element, if the attribute is present and not empty. Otherwise the
  command is an <span>anonymous command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> of the command
  is the value of the element's <code
  title="attr-command-label">label</code> attribute, if there is one,
  or the empty string if it doesn't.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> of the command
  is the string given by the element's <code
  title="attr-command-title">title</code> attribute, if any, and the
  empty string if the attribute is absent.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span> for the command
  is the absolute URI resulting from resolving the value of the
  element's <code title="attr-command-icon">icon</code> attribute as a
  URI relative to the element's base URI. If the element has no <code
  title="attr-command-icon">icon</code> attribute then the command has
  no <span title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span>
  of the command is true (hidden) if the element has a <code
  title="attr-command-hidden">hidden</code> attribute, and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled

  <h4><dfn>Building menus</dfn></h4>

  <p>A menu consists of a list of zero or more of the following
  components:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li><span title="concept-command">Commands</span>, which can be marked as default commands</li>
   <li>Separators</li>
   <li>Other menus (which allows the list to be nested)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The list corresponding to a particular element is built by
  iterating over its child nodes.</p>

  <p>For each child node in <span>tree order</span>, the required behaviour
  depends on what the node is, as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>An element that <span title="concept-command">defines a command</span></dt>

   <dd>Append the command to the menu. If the element is a
   <code>command</code> element with a <code
   title="attr-command-default">default</code> attribute, mark the
   command as being a default command.</dd>


   <dt>An <code>hr</code> element</dt>
   <dt>An <code>option</code> element that has a <code
   title="attr-option-value">value</code> attribute set to the empty
   string, and has a <code
   title="attr-option-disabled">disabled</code> attribute, and whose
   <code>textContent</code> consists of a string of one or more
   hyphens (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS)</dt>

   <dd>Append a separator to the menu.</dd>


   <dt>An <code>li</code> element</dt>

   <dd>Iterate over the children of the <code>li</code> element.</dd>


   <dt>A <code>menu</code> element with no <code title="attr-menu-label">label</code> attribute</dt>
   <dt>A <code>select</code> element</dt>

   <dd>Append a separator to the menu, then iterate over the children
   of the <code>menu</code> or <code>select</code> element, then
   append another separator.</dd>


   <dt>A <code>menu</code> element with a <code title="attr-menu-label">label</code> attribute</dt>
   <dt>An <code>optgroup</code> element</dt>

   <dd>Append a submenu to the menu, using the value of the element's
   <code title="">label</code> attribute as the label of the menu. The
   submenu must be constructed by taking the element and creating a
   new menu for it using the complete process described in this
   section.</dd>


   <dt>Any other node</dt>

   <dd><span>Ignore</span> the node.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Once all the nodes have been processed as described above, the
  user agent must the post-process the menu as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Any menu item with no label, or whose label is the empty string, must be removed.</li>

   <li>Any sequence of two or more separators in a row must be collapsed to a single separator.</li>

   <li>Any separator at the start or end of the menu must be removed.</li>

  </ol>


  <h4><dfn>Context menus</dfn></h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-contextmenu"><code>contextmenu</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the element's <span title="context menus">context
  menu</span>. The value must be the ID of a <code>menu</code> element
  in the DOM. If the node that would be obtained by the invoking the
  <code>getElementById()</code> method using the attribute's value as
  the only argument is null or not a <code>menu</code> element, then
  the element has no assigned context menu. Otherwise, the element's
  assigned context menu is the element so identified.</p>

  <p>When an element's context menu is requested (e.g. by the user
  right-clicking the element, or pressing a context menu key), the UA
  must <span>fire a <code title="">contextmenu</code> event</span> on
  the element for which the menu was requested.</p>

  <p class="note">Typically, therefore, the firing of the <code
  title="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event will be the
  default action of a <code title="mouseup">mouseup</code> or <code
  title="event-keyup">keyup</code> event. The exact sequence of events
  is UA-dependent, as it will vary based on platform conventions.</p>

  <p>The default action of the <code
  title="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event depends on
  whether the element has a context menu assigned (using the <code
  title="attr-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> attribute) or not. If it
  does not, the default action must be for the user agent to show its
  default context menu, if it has one.</p>

  <p>If the element <em>does</em> have a context menu assigned, then
  the user agent must <span>fire a <code title="">show</code>
  event</span> on the relevant <code>menu</code> element.</p>

  <p>The default action of <em>this</em> event is that the user agent
  must show a context menu <span title="building menus">built</span>
  from the <code>menu</code> element.</p>

  <p>The user agent may also provide access to its default context
  menu, if any, with the context menu shown. For example, it could
  merge the menu items from the two menus together, or provide the
  page's context menu as a submenu of the default menu.</p>

  <p>If the user dismisses the menu without making a selection,
  nothing in particular happens.</p>

  <p>If the user selects a menu item that represents a <span
  title="concept-commands">command</span>, then the UA must invoke
  that command's <span title="command-facet-Action">Action</span>, as
  defined above.</p>

  <p>Context menus must not, while being shown, reflect changes in the
  DOM; they are constructed as the default action of the <code
  title="event-show">show</code> event and must remain like that until
  dismissed.</p>

  <p>User agents may provide means for bypassing the context menu
  processing model, ensuring that the user can always access the UA's
  default context menus. For example, the user agent could handle
  right-clicks that have the Shift key depressed in such a way that it
  does not fire the <code title="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code>
  event and instead always shows the default context menu.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-contextMenu"><code>contextMenu</code></dfn>
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> content attribute.</p>


  <h4><dfn>Toolbars</dfn></h4>

  <p>Toolbars are a kind of menu that is always visible.</p>

  <p>When a <code>menu</code> element has a <code
  title="attr-menu-type">type</code> attribute with the value <code
  title="">toolbar</code>, then the user agent must <span
  title="building menus">build</span> the menu for that
  <code>menu</code> element and <span
  title="render-toolbar">render</span><!-- XXX xref --> it in the
  document in a position appropriate for that <code>menu</code>
  element.</p>

  <p>The user agent must reflect changes made to the
  <code>menu</code>'s DOM immediately in the UI.</p>

  <h3 id="history"><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Session history and navigation</h3>

  <h4>The <dfn>session history</dfn> of browsing contexts</h4>

  <!-- XXX would be nice to have an intro paragraph that DFNed session
  history instead of having the header do it -->

  <p><code>History</code> objects provide a representation of the
  pages in the session history of their <code>Window</code> object's
  <span>browsing context</span>. Each browsing context
  (<code>frame</code>, <code>iframe</code>, etc) has a distinct
  session history.</p> <!-- conf crit for that last statement is in
  the bit that defines browsing context -->

  <p>Each <code>DocumentUI</code> object in a browsing context's
  session history is associated with a unique instance of the
  <code>History</code> object, although they all must model the same
  underlying session history.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-history"><code>history</code></dfn> attribute
  of the <code>Window</code> interface must return the object
  implementing the <code>History</code> interface for that
  <code>Window</code> object's associated <code>DocumentUI</code>
  object.</p>

  <p><code>History</code> objects represent their <span>browsing
  context</span>'s session history as a flat list of URIs and
  <span title="state object">state objects</span>. (This does not imply
  that the UI need be linear. See the <a href="#history-notes">notes
  below</a>.)

  <p>Typically, the history list will consist of only URIs. However, a
  page can <span title="dom-history-pushState">add</span> <dfn
  title="state object">state objects</dfn> between its entry in the
  session history and the next ("forward") entry. These are then <span
  title="event-popstate">returned to the script</span> when the user
  (or script) goes back in the history, thus enabling authors to use
  the "navigation" metaphor even in one-page applications.</p>

  <p>Entries that consist of <span title="state object">state
  objects</span> share the same <code>DocumentUI</code> as the
  entry for the URI itself. Contiguous entries that differ just by
  fragment identifier must also share the same
  <code>DocumentUI</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">All entries that share the same
  <code>DocumentUI</code> (and that are therefore merely different
  states of one particular document) are contiguous by definition.</p>

  <p>At any point, one of the entries in the session history is the
  <dfn>current entry</dfn>. This is the entry representing the page in
  this <span>browsing context</span> that is considered the "current"
  page by the UA. The <span>current entry</span> is usually an entry
  for the <span title="dom-location-href">location</span> of the
  <code>DocumentUI</code>. However, it can also be one of the
  entries for <span title="state object">state objects</span> added to
  the history by that document.</p>

  <p>When the browser's navigation model differs significantly from
  the sequential model represented by the <code>History</code>
  interface, for example if separate <code>DocumentUI</code>
  objects in the session history are all simulatenously displayed and
  active, then the <span>current entry</span> could even be an entry
  unrelated to the <code>History</code> object's own
  <code>DocumentUI</code> object. If, when a method is invoked on
  a <code>History</code> object, the <span>current entry</span> for
  that <span>browsing context</span>'s session history has a different
  <code>DocumentUI</code> object than the <code>History</code>
  object's own <code>DocumentUI</code> object, then the user agent
  must raise a <code>NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR</code> DOM exception.
  (This can only happen if scripts are allowed to run in documents
  that are not the current document. Typically, however, user agents
  only allow scripts from the <span>current entry</span> to
  execute.)</p>

  <p>User agents may <dfn>discard</dfn> the DOMs of entries other than
  the <span>current entry</span>, reloading the pages afresh when the
  user or script navigates back to such pages. This specification does
  not specify when user agents should discard pages' DOMs and when
  they should cache them. See the section on the <code
  title="event-load">load</code> and <code
  title="event-unload">unload</code> events for more details.</p> <!--
  XXX crossref! -->

  <p>Entries that have had their DOM discarded must, for the purposes
  of the algorithms given below, act as if they had not. When the user
  or script navigates back or forwards to a page which has no
  in-memory DOM objects, any other entries that shared the same
  <code>DocumentUI</code> object with it must share the new object
  as well.</p>

  <p>When a user agent discards the DOM from an entry in the session
  history, it must also discard all the entries from the first state
  object entry for that <code>DocumentUI</code> object up to and
  including the last entry for that <code>DocumentUI</code> object
  (including any non-state-object entries in that range, such as
  entries where the user navigated using fragment identifiers). These
  entries are not recreated if the user or script navigates back to
  the page. If there are no state object entries for that
  <code>DocumentUI</code> object then no entries are removed.</p>

  <h4>The <code>History</code> interface</h4>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>History</dfn> {
  readonly attribute long <span title="dom-history-length">length</span>;
<!--  DOMString <span title="dom-history-item">item</span>(in unsigned long index);
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-history-current">current</span>;

  void <span title="dom-history-pushState">pushState</span>(in DOMObject data);
  void <span title="dom-history-clearState">clearState</span>();
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-history-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute of the <code>History</code> interface must return the
  number of entries in this session history.</p>

  <p>The actual entries are not accessible from script.</p>

<!--
  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-history-item"><code>item(<var title="">index</var>)</code></dfn>
  function must raise a <span>security exception</span>.</p>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, objects implementing this interface
  must support being dereferenced using square bracket notation (e.g.
  <code>history[1]</code>). Dereferencing with an integer index must
  be treated as equivalent to invoking the <code>item()</code> method
  with that index.</p>
-->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-history-go"><code>go(<var title="">delta</var>)</code></dfn>
  method causes the UA to move the number of steps specified by
  <var title="">delta</var> in the session history.</p>

  <p>If the index of the <span>current entry</span> plus
  <var title="">delta</var> is less than zero or greater than or equal to the
  <span title="dom-history-length">number of items in the session
  history</span>, then the user agent must do nothing.</p>

  <p>If the <var title="">delta</var> is zero, then the user agent must act as
  if the <code title="dom-location-reload">location.reload()</code>
  method was called instead.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the user agent must cause the current <span>browsing
  context</span> to navigate to the specified entry, as described
  below. The specified entry is the one whose index equals the index
  of the <span>current entry</span> plus <var title="">delta</var>.</p>

  <p>If there are any entries with state objects between the current
  entry and the specified entry (not inclusive), then the user agent
  must iterate through every entry between the current entry and the
  specified entry, starting with the entry closest to the current
  entry, and ending with the one closest to the specified entry. For
  each entry, if the entry is a state object, the user agent must
  <span>activate the state object</span>.</p>

  <p>If the specified entry has a different
  <code>DocumentUI</code> object than the <span>current
  entry</span> then the user agent must make that
  <code>DocumentUI</code> object the user's "current" one for that
  <span>browsing context</span>.</p>

  <p>If the specified entry is a state object, the user agent must
  <span title="activate the state object">activate that state
  object</span>. Otherwise, the user agent must update the current
  <span title="dom-location">location</span> object to the new
  location.</p>

  <p>User agents may also update other aspects of the document view
  when the location changes in this way, for instance the scroll
  position, values of form fields, etc.</p>

  <p>When the user navigates through a <span>browsing context</span>,
  e.g. using a browser's back and forward buttons, the user agent must
  translate this action into the equivalent invocations of the <code
  title="dom-history-go">history.go(<var title="">delta</var>)</code> method on
  the various affected <code title="dom-window">window</code>
  objects.</p>

  <p>Some of the other members of the <code>History</code> interface

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-history-pushState"><code>pushState(<var title="">data</var>)</code></dfn>
  method adds a state object to the history.</p>

  <p>When this method is invoked, the user agent must first remove
  from the session history any entries for that
  <code>DocumentUI</code> from the entry after the <span>current
  entry</span> up to the last entry in the session history that
  references the same <code>DocumentUI</code> object, if any. If
  the <span>current entry</span> is the last entry in the session
  history, or if there are no entries after the <span>current
  entry</span> that reference the same <code>DocumentUI</code>
  object, then no entries are removed.</p>

  <p>Then, the user agent must add a state object entry to the session
  history, after the <span>current entry</span>, with the specified
  <var title="">data</var> as the state object.</p>

  <p>Finally, the user agent must update the <span>current
  entry</span> to be the this newly added entry.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">There has been a suggestion that pushState()
  should take a URI and a string; the URI to allow for the page to be
  bookmarked, and the string to allow the UA to give the page a
  meaningful title in the history state, if it shows history
  state.</p> <!-- XXX could have four variants of pushState to allow
  with/without URI and with/without title. Or maybe URI only makes
  sense if there is a title. -->

  <p>User agents may limit the number of state objects added to the
  session history per page. If a page hits the UA-defined limit, user
  agents must remove the entry immediately after the first entry for
  that <code>DocumentUI</code> object in the session history after
  having added the new entry. (Thus the state history acts as a FIFO
  buffer for eviction, but as a LIFO buffer for navigation.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-history-clearState"><code>clearState()</code></dfn>
  method removes all the state objects for the
  <code>DocumentUI</code> object from the session history.</p>

  <p>When this method is invoked, the user agent must remove from the
  session history all the entries from the first state object entry
  for that <code>DocumentUI</code> object up to the last entry
  that references that same <code>DocumentUI</code> object, if
  any.</p>

  <p>Then, if the <span>current entry</span> was removed in the
  previous step, the <span>current entry</span> must be set to the
  last entry for that <code>DocumentUI</code> object in the
  session history.</p>

  <h4><dfn title="activate the state object">Activating state objects</dfn></h4>

  <p>When a state object in the session history is activated (which
  happens in the cases described above), the user agent must fire a
  <dfn title="event-popstate"><code>popstate</code></dfn> event in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code> namespace on the
  <span>the body element</span> using the
  <code>PopStateEvent</code> interface, with the state object in the
  <code title="dom-PopStateEvent-state">state</code> attribute. This
  event bubbles but is not cancelable and has no default action.</p>

  <!-- XXX onpopstate should be defined somewhere -->

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>PopStateEvent</dfn> : Event {
  readonly attribute DOMObject <span title="dom-PopStateEvent-state">state</span>;

};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-PopStateEvent-initPopStateEvent"><code>initPopStateEvent()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn
  title="dom-PopStateEvent-initPopStateEventNS"><code>initPopStateEventNS()</code></dfn>
  methods must initialise the event in a manner analogous to the
  similarly-named methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a
  href="#DOM3Events">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-PopStateEvent-state"><code>state</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the context information for the event.</p>


  <h4>The <code>Location</code> interface</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-location"><code>location</code></dfn>
  attribute of the <code>Window</code> interface must return
  an object implementing the <code>Location</code> interface.</p>

  <p>For historical reasons, the <dfn
  title="dom-document-location"><code>location</code></dfn> attribute
  of the <code>DocumentUI</code> interface must return the same
  object as the <code title="dom-location">location</code> attribute
  on its associated <code>Window</code> object.</p>

  <p><code>Location</code> objects provide a representation of the URI
  of their document, and allow the <span>current entry</span> of the
  <span>browsing context</span>'s session history to be changed, by
  adding or replacing entries in the <code
  title="dom-history">history</code> object.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>Location</dfn> {
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-location-hash">hash</span>;

  void <span title="dom-location-reload">reload</span>();
};</pre>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, objects implementing this
  interface must stringify to the same value as the <code
  title="dom-location-href">href</code> attribute.</p>

  <p id="settingLocation">In the ECMAScript DOM binding, the <code

  title="dom-location-href">href</code> attribute of the relevant
  <code>Location</code> object instead.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-location-href"><code>href</code></dfn>
  attribute returns the address of the page represented by the
  associated <code>DocumentUI</code> object, as an absolute IRI
  reference.</p>

  <p>On setting, <!--XXX Mozilla does this, but IE doesn't. What

  method had been called with the new value as its
  argument. Otherwise,--> the user agent must act as if the <code
  title="dom-location-assign">assign()</code> method had been called

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-location-assign"><code>assign(<var title="">url</var>)</code></dfn>
  method is invoked, the UA must remove all the entries after the
  <span>current entry</span> in its <code>DocumentUI</code>'s
  <code>History</code> object, add a new entry, with the given
  <var title="">url</var>, at the end of the list (asynchronously loading the
  new page if necessary), and then advance to that page as if the
  <code title="dom-history-forward">history.forward()</code> method
  had been invoked.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn title="dom-location-replace"><code>replace(<var
  title="">url</var>)</code></dfn> method is invoked, the UA must act
  as if the <code title="dom-location-assign">assign()</code> method
  had been invoked, but with the additional step of removing the entry
  that was the <span>current entry</span> before the method call after
  the above steps (thus simply causing the current page to be replaced
  by the new one).</p>

  <p>In both cases, if the location before the method call would
  differ from the location after the method only in terms of the

  <p>Relative <var title="">url</var> arguments for <code

  <h4 id="history-notes">Implementation notes for session history</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>The <code>History</code> interface is not meant to place
  restrictions on how implementations represent the session history to
  the user.</p>

  <p>For example, session history could be implemented in a tree-like
  manner, with each page having multiple "forward" pages. This
  specification doesn't define how the linear list of pages in the
  <code title="dom-history">history</code> object are derived from the
  actual session history as seen from the user's perspective.</p>

  <p>Similarly, a page containing two <code>iframe</code>s has a <code
  title="dom-history">history</code> object distinct from the
  <code>iframe</code>s' <code title="dom-history">history</code>
  objects, despite the fact that typical Web browsers present the user
  with just one "Back" button, with a session history that interleaves
  the navigation of the two inner frames and the outer page.</p>

  <p><strong>Security:</strong> It is suggested that to avoid letting
  a page "hijack" the history navigation facilities of a UA by abusing
  <code title="dom-history-pushState">pushState()</code>, the UA
  provide the user with a way to jump back to the previous page
  (rather than just going back to the previous state). For example,
  the back button could have a drop down showing just the pages in the
  session history, and not showing any of the states. Similarly, an
  aural browser could have two "back" commands, one that goes back to
  the previous state, and one that jumps straight back to the previous
  page.</p>

  <p>In addition, a user agent could ignore calls to <code
  title="dom-history-pushState">pushState()</code> that are invoked on
  a timer, or from event handlers that do not represent a clear user
  action, or that are invoked in rapid succession.</p>



  <h3>Browser state</h3>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-navigator"><code>navigator</code></dfn>
  attribute of the <code>Window</code> interface must return an
  instance of the <code>ClientInformation</code> interface, which
  represents the identity and state of the user agent (the client),
  and allows Web pages to register themselves as potential protocol
  and content handlers:</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>ClientInformation</dfn> {
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-navigator-onLine">onLine</span>;
  void <span title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler</span>(in DOMString protocol, in DOMString uri, in DOMString title);
  void <span title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler</span>(in DOMString mimeType, in DOMString uri, in DOMString title);
<!-- XXX there are other attributes! -->};</pre>
<!-- also, see window.external.AddSearchProvider() and similar DOM APIs from IE -->

  <h4><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Offline Web applications</h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-navigator-onLine"><code>navigator.onLine</code></dfn>
  attribute must return false if the user agent will not contact the
  network when the user follows links or when a script requests a
  remote page (or knows that such an attempt would fail), and must
  return true otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-offline"><code>offline</code></dfn> event
  must be fired when the value of the <code
  title="dom-navigator-onLine">navigator.onLine</code> attribute of the
  <code>Window</code> changes from true to false.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-online"><code>online</code></dfn> event
  must be fired when the value of the <code
  title="dom-navigator-onLine">navigator.onLine</code> attribute of the
  <code>Window</code> changes from false to true.</p>

  <p>These events are in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code> namespace, do bubble,
  are not cancelable, have no default action, and use the normal
  <code>Event</code> interface. They must be fired on <span>the body
  element</span>. (As the events bubble, they will reach the
  <code>Window</code> object.)</p>

  <!-- XXX ononline onoffline need to be defined -->

  <h4 id="custom-handlers"><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Custom protocol and content handlers</h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler"><code>registerProtocolHandler()</code></dfn>
  method allows Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers
  for particular protocols. For example, an online fax service could
  register itself as a handler of the <code>fax:</code> protocol (<a
  href="#refsRFC2806">[RFC2806]</a>), so that if the user clicks on
  such a link, he is given the opportunity to use that Web
  site. Analogously, the <dfn
  title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler"><code>registerContentHandler()</code></dfn>
  method allows Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers
  for content in a particular MIME type. For example, the same online
  fax service could register itself as a handler for
  <code>image/g3fax</code> files (<a
  href="#refsRFC1494">[RFC1494]</a>), so that if the user has no
  native application capable of handling G3 Facsimile byte streams,
  his Web browser can instead suggest he use that site to view the
  image.</a>

  <p>User agents may, within the constraints described in this
  section, do whatever they like when the methods are called. A UA
  could, for instance, prompt the user and offer the user the
  opportunity to add the site to a shortlist of handlers, or make the
  handlers his default, or cancel the request. UAs could provide such
  a UI through modal UI or through a non-modal transient notification
  interface. UAs could also simply silently collect the information,
  providing it only when relevant to the user.</p>

  <p>There is <a href="#sample-handler-impl">an example of how these
  methods could be presented to the user</a> below.</p>

  <p>The arguments to the methods have the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><var title="">protocol</var> (<code title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler()</code> only)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A scheme, such as <code>ftp</code> or <code>fax</code>. The
    scheme must be treated case-insensitively by user agents for the
    purposes of comparing with the scheme part of URIs that they
    consider against the list of registered handlers.</p>

    <p>The <var title="">protocol</var> value, if it contains a colon (as in
    "<code>ftp:</code>"), will never match anything, since schemes
    don't contain colons.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var title="">mimeType</var> (<code title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler()</code> only)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A MIME type, such as <code>model/vrml</code> or
    <code>text/richtext</code>. The MIME type must be treated
    case-insensitively by user agents for the purposes of comparing
    with MIME types of documents that they consider against the list
    of registered handlers.</p>

    <p>User agents must compare the given values only to the MIME
    type/subtype parts of content types, not to the complete type
    including parameters. Thus, if <var title="">mimeType</var> values
    passed to this method include characters such as commas or
    whitespace, or include MIME parameters, then the handler being
    registered will never be used.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var title="">uri</var></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The URI of the page that will handle the requests. When the
    user agent uses this URI, it must replace the first occurrence of
    the exact literal string "<code>%s</code>" with an escaped version
    of the URI of the content in question (as defined below), and then
    fetch the resulting URI using the GET method (or equivalent for
    non-HTTP URIs).</p>

    <p>To get the escaped version of the URI, first, the domain part
    of the URI (if any) must be converted to its punycode
    representation, and then, every character in the URI that is not
    in the ranges given in the next paragraph must be replaced by its
    UTF-8 byte representation, each byte being represented by a U+0025
    (%) character and two digits in the range U+0030 (0) to U+0039 (9)
    and U+0041 (A) to U+0046 (F) giving the hexadecimal representation
    of the byte.</p>

    <p>The ranges of characters that must not be escaped are: U+002D
    (-), U+002E (.), U+0030 (0) to U+0039 (9), U+0041 (A) to U+005A
    (Z), U+005F (_), U+0061 (a) to U+007A (z), and U+007E (~).</p>

    <!-- XXX move that to a common algorithms section if any other
    part of the spec needs it -->

    <div class="example">

     <p>If the user had visited a site that made the following call:</p>

     <pre>navigator.registerContentHandler('application/x-soup', 'http://example.com/soup?url=%s', 'SoupWeb&trade;')</pre>

     <p>...and then clicked on a link such as:</p>

     <pre>&lt;a href="http://www.example.net/chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup">Download our Chicken Kiwi soup!&lt;/a></pre>

     <p>...then, assuming this <code>chickenkiwi.soup</code> file was
     served with the MIME type <code>application/x-soup</code>, the UA
     might instead navigate to the following URI:</p>

     <pre>http://example.com/soup?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.net%2Fchickenk%C3%AFwi.soup</pre>

     <p>This site could then fetch the <code>chickenkiwi.soup</code>
     file and do whatever it is that it does with soup (synthesise it
     and ship it to the user, or whatever).</p>

    </div>

   </dd>

   <dt><var title="">title</var></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A descriptive title of the handler, which the UA might use to
    remind the user what the site in question is.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>User agents should raise <span title="security
  exception">security exceptions</span> if the methods are called with
  <var title="">protocol</var> or <var title="">mimeType</var> values
  that the UA deems to be "privileged". For example, a site attempting
  to register a handler for <code>http</code> URIs or
  <code>text/html</code> content in a Web browser would likely cause
  an exception to be raised.</p>

  <p>User agents must raise a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception if the
  <var title="">uri</var> argument passed to one of these methods does
  not contain the exact literal string "<code>%s</code>".</p>

  <p>User agents must not raise any other exceptions (other than
  binding-specific exceptions, such as for an incorrect number of
  arguments in an ECMAScript implementation).</p>

  <p>This section does not define how the pages registered by these
  methods are used, beyond the requirements on how to process the
  <var title="">uri</var> value (see above). To some extent, the <span
  title="navigating across documents">processing model for navigating
  across documents</span> defines some cases where these methods are
  relevant, but in general UAs may use this information wherever they
  would otherwise consider handing content to native plugins or helper
  applications.</p>

  <p>UAs must not use registered content handlers to handle content
  that was returned as part of a non-GET transaction (or rather, as
  part of any non-idempotent transaction), as the remote site would
  not be able to fetch the same data.</p>


  <h5>Security and privacy</h5>

  <p>These mechanisms can introduce a number of concerns, in
  particular privacy concerns.</p>

  <p><strong>Hijacking all Web usage.</strong> User agents should not
  allow protocols that are key to its normal operation, such as
  <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>, to be rerouted through
  third-party sites. This would allow a user's activities to be
  trivially tracked, and would allow user information, even in secure
  connections, to be collected.</p>

  <p><strong>Hijacking defaults.</strong> It is strongly recommended
  that user agents do not automatically change any defaults, as this
  could lead the user to send data to remote hosts that the user is
  not expecting. New handlers registering themselves should never
  automatically cause those sites to be used.</p>

  <p><strong>Registration spamming.</strong> User agents should
  consider the possibility that a site will attempt to register a
  large number of handlers, possibly from multiple domains (e.g. by
  redirecting through a series of pages each on a different domain,
  and each registering a handler for <code>video/mpeg</code> &mdash;
  analogous practices abusing other Web browser features have been
  used by pornography Web sites for many years). User agents should
  gracefully handle such hostile attempts, protecting the user.</p>

  <p><strong>Misleading titles.</strong> User agents should not rely
  wholy on the <var title="">title</var> argument to the methods when
  presenting the registered handlers to the user, since sites could
  easily lie. For example, a site <code>hostile.example.net</code>
  could claim that it was registering the "Cuddly Bear Happy Content
  Handler". User agents should therefore use the handler's domain in
  any UI along with any title.</p>

  <p><strong>Hostile handler metadata.</strong> User agents should
  protect against typical attacks against strings embedded in their
  interface, for example ensuring that markup or escape characters in
  such strings are not executed, that null bytes are properly handled,
  that over-long strings do not cause crashes or buffer overruns, and
  so forth.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking Intranet URIs.</strong> The mechanism described
  in this section can result in secret Intranet URIs being leaked, in
  the following manner:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>The user registers a third-party content handler as the default
   handler for a content type.</li>

   <li>The user then browses his corporate Intranet site and accesses
   a document that uses that content type.</li>

   <li>The user agent contacts the third party and hands the third
   party the URI to the Intranet content.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>No actual confidential file data is leaked in this manner, but
  the URIs themselves could contain confidential information. For
  example, the URI could be
  <code>https://www.corp.example.com/upcoming-aquisitions/samples.egf</code>,
  which might tell the third party that Example Corporation is
  intending to merge with Samples LLC. Implementors might wish to
  consider allowing administrators to disable this feature for certain
  subdomains, content types, or protocols.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking secure URIs.</strong> User agents should not send
  HTTPS URIs to third party sites registered as content handlers, in
  the same way that user agents do not send <code>Referer</code>
  headers from secure sites to third party sites.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking credentials.</strong> User agents must never send
  username or password information in the URIs that are escaped and
  included sent to the handler sites. User agents may even avoid
  attempting to pass to Web-based handlers the URIs of resources
  that are known to require authentication to access, as such sites
  would be unable to access the resources in question without
  prompting the user for credentials themselves (a practice that would
  require the user to know whether to trust the third party handler, a
  decision many users are unable to make or even understand).</p>

  <h3><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Client-side session and persistent storage</h3> <!-- local storage -->

  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification introduces two related mechanisms, similar to
  HTTP session cookies <a href="#refsRFC2965">[RFC2965]</a>, for
  storing structured data on the client side.</p>

  <p>The first is designed for scenarios where the user is carrying
  out a single transaction, but could be carrying out multiple
  transactions in different windows at the same time.</p>

  <p>Cookies don't really handle this case well. For example, a user
  could be buying plane tickets in two different windows, using the
  same site. If the site used cookies to keep track of which ticket
  the user was buying, then as the user clicked from page to page in
  both windows, the ticket currently being purchased would "leak" from
  one window to the other, potentially causing the user to buy two
  tickets for the same flight without really noticing.</p>

  <p>To address this, this specification introduces the <code
  title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> DOM attribute.
  Sites can add data to the session storage, and it will be accessible
  to any page from that domain opened in that window.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, a page could have a checkbox that the user ticks to
   indicate that he wants insurance:</p>

   <pre>&lt;label>
 &lt;input type="checkbox" onchange="sessionStorage.insurance = checked">
 I want insurance on this trip.
&lt;/label></pre>

   <p>A later page could then check, from script, whether the user had
   checked the checkbox or not:</p>

   <pre>if (sessionStorage.insurance) { ... }</pre>

   <p>If the user had multiple windows opened on the site, each one
   would have its own individual copy of the session storage object.</p>

  </div>

  <!--

   sessionStorage.flightDeparture = 'OSL';
   sessionStorage.flightArrival = 'NYC';

   for (var i in forms[0].elements)
      sessionStorage["data_" + i.name] = i.value;

   if (!sessionStorage[documents])
     sessionStorage[documents] = {};
   sessionStorage[documents][filename] = <document/>;

  -->

  <p>The second storage mechanism is designed for storage that spans
  multiple windows, and lasts beyond the current session. In
  particular, Web applications may wish to store megabytes of user
  data, such as entire user-authored documents or a user's mailbox, on
  the clientside for performance reasons.</p>

  <p>Again, cookies do not handle this case well, because they are
  transmitted with every request.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-globalStorage">globalStorage</code> DOM
  attribute is used to access the global storage areas.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The site at example.com can display a count of how many times
   the user has loaded its page by putting the following at the bottom
   of its page:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>
  You have viewed this page
  &lt;span id="count">an untold number of&lt;/span>
  time(s).
&lt;/p>
&lt;script>
  var storage = globalStorage['example.com'];
  if (!storage.pageLoadCount)
    storage.pageLoadCount = 0;
  storage.pageLoadCount = parseInt(storage.pageLoadCount, 10) + 1;
  document.getElementById('count').textContent = storage.pageLoadCount;
&lt;/script></pre>

  </div>

  <p>Each domain and each subdomain has its own separate storage area.
  Subdomains can access the storage areas of parent domains, and
  domains can access the storage areas of subdomains.</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li><code>globalStorage['']</code> is accessible to all domains.</li>
   <li><code>globalStorage['com']</code> is accessible to all .com domains</li>
   <li><code>globalStorage['example.com']</code> is accessible to example.com and any of its subdomains</li>
   <li><code>globalStorage['www.example.com']</code> is accessible to www.example.com and example.com, but not www2.example.com.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Storage areas (both session storage and global storage) store
  strings. To store structured data in a storage area, you must first
  convert it to a string.</p>


  <h4>The <code>Storage</code> interface</h4>

  <pre class="idl">
interface <dfn>Storage</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-Storage-length">length</span>;
  DOMString <span title="dom-Storage-key">key</span>(in unsigned long index);
  <span>StorageItem</span> <span title="dom-Storage-getItem">getItem</span>(in DOMString key);
  void <span title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem</span>(in DOMString key, in DOMString data);
  void <span title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem</span>(in DOMString key);
};</pre>

  <p>Each <code>Storage</code> object provides access to a list of
  key/value pairs, which are sometimes called items. Keys are strings,
  and any string (including the empty string) is a valid key. Values
  are strings with associated metadata, represented by
  <code>StorageItem</code> objects.</p>

  <p>Each <code>Storage</code> object is associated with a list of
  key/value pairs when it is created, as defined in the sections on
  the <code title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> and <code
  title="dom-globalStorage">globalStorage</code> attributes. Multiple
  separate objects implementing the <code>Storage</code> interface can
  all be associated with the same list of key/value pairs
  simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Key/value pairs have associated metadata. In particular, a
  key/value pair can be marked as either "safe only for secure
  content", or as "safe for both secure and insecure content".</p>

  <p>A key/value pair is <dfn title="accessible keys">accessible</dfn>
  if either it is marked as "safe for both secure and insecure
  content", or it is marked as "safe only for secure content" and the
  script in question is running in a <span title="secure scripting
  contexts">secure scripting context</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of key/value pairs currently
  present and <span title="accessible keys">accessible</span> in the
  list associated with the object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-key"><code>key(<var
  title="">n</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the name of the
  <var title="">n</var>th <span>accessible</span> key in the list. The
  order of keys is user-agent defined, but must be consistent within
  an object between changes to the number of keys. (Thus, <span
  title="dom-Storage-setItem">adding</span> or <span
  title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removing</span> a key may change the
  order of the keys, but merely changing the value of an existing key
  must not.) <!--The order of keys may differ between instances of the
  <code>Storage</code> interface accessing the same list. [removed for
  now for clarity, but if people ask, put it back. this is part of the
  spec.]--> If <var title="">n</var> is less than zero or greater than
  or equal to the number of key/value pairs in the object, then this
  method must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-getItem"><code>getItem(<var
  title="">key</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the
  <code>StorageItem</code> object representing the key/value pair with
  the given <var title="">key</var>. If the given <var
  title="">key</var> does not exist in the list associated with the
  object, or is not <span>accessible</span>, then this method must
  return null. Subsequent calls to this method with the same key from
  scripts running in the same <span>security context</span> must
  return the same instance of the <code>StorageItem</code>
  interface. (Such instances must not be shared across security
  contexts, though.)</p> <!-- XXX define security context -->

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-setItem"><code>setItem(<var
  title="">key</var>, <var title="">value</var>)</code></dfn> method
  must first check if a key/value pair with the given <var
  title="">key</var> already exists in the list associated with the
  object.</p>

  <p>If it does not, then a new key/value pair must be added to the
  list, with the given <var title="">key</var> and <var
  title="">value</var>, such that any current or future
  <code>StorageItem</code> objects referring to this key/value pair
  will return the value given in the <var title="">value</var>
  argument. If the script setting the value is running in a <span
  title="secure scripting contexts">secure scripting context</span>,
  then the key/value pair must be marked as "safe only for secure
  content", otherwise it must be marked as "safe for both secure and
  insecure content".</p>

  <p>If the given <var title="">key</var> <em>does</em> exist in the
  list, then, if the key/value pair with the given <var
  title="">key</var> is <span>accessible</span>, it must have its
  value updated so that any current or future <code>StorageItem</code>
  objects referring to this key/value pair will return the value given
  in the <var title="">value</var> argument. If it is <em>not</em>
  <span>accessible</span>, the method must raise a <span>security
  exception</span>.</p>

  <p>When the <code title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code>
  method is successfully invoked (i.e. when it doesn't raise an
  exception), events are fired on other <code>HTMLDocument</code>
  objects that can access the newly stored data, as defined in the
  sections on the <code
  title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> and <code
  title="dom-globalStorage">globalStorage</code> attributes.</p> <!--
  not normative, see the sections below for the normative statement
  -->

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-removeItem"><code>removeItem(<var
  title="">key</var>)</code></dfn> method must cause the key/value
  pair with the given <var title="">key</var> to be removed from the
  list associated with the object, if it exists and is
  <span>accessible</span>. If no item with that key exists, the method
  must do nothing. If an item with that key exists but is not
  <span>accessible</span>, the method must raise a <span>security
  exception</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> and <code
  title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code> methods must be
  atomic with respect to failure. That is, changes to the data storage
  area must either be successful, or the data storage area must not be
  changed at all.</p>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, enumerating a <code>Storage</code>
  object must enumerate through the currently stored and
  <span>accessible</span> keys in the list the object is associated
  with. (It must not enumerate the values or the actual members of the
  interface). In the ECMAScript DOM binding, <code>Storage</code> objects
  must support dereferencing such that getting a property that is not
  a member of the object (i.e. is neither a member of the
  <code>Storage</code> interface nor of <code>Object</code>) must
  invoke the <code title="dom-Storage-getItem">getItem()</code> method
  with the property's name as the argument, and setting such a
  property must invoke the <code
  title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> method with the
  property's name as the first argument and the given value as the
  second argument.</p>


  <h4>The <code>StorageItem</code> interface</h4>

  <p>Items in <code>Storage</code> objects are represented by objects
  implementing the <code>StorageItem</code> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">
interface <dfn>StorageItem</dfn> {
           attribute boolean <span title="dom-StorageItem-secure">secure</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-StorageItem-value">value</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, <code>StorageItem</code> objects must
  stringify to their <code title="dom-StorageItem-value">value</code>
  attribute's value.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-StorageItem-value"><code>value</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the current value of the key/value pair
  represented by the object. When the attribute is set, the user agent
  must invoke the <code title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code>
  method of the <code>Storage</code> object that the
  <code>StorageItem</code> object is associated with, with the key
  that the <code>StorageItem</code> object is associated with as the
  first argument, and the new given value of the attribute as the
  second argument.</p>

  <p><code>StorageItem</code> objects must be <em>live</em>, meaning
  that as the underlying <code>Storage</code> object has its key/value
  pairs updated, the <code>StorageItem</code> objects must always
  return the actual value of the key/value pair they represent.</p>

  <p>If the key/value pair has been deleted, the
  <code>StorageItem</code> object must act as if its value was the
  empty string. On setting, the key/value pair will be recreated.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-StorageItem-secure"><code>secure</code></dfn>
  attribute must raise an <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception
  when accessed or set from a script whose script context is not <span
  title="secure scripting contexts">considered secure</span><!-- XXX
  xref -->. (Basically, if the page is not an SSL page.)</p>

  <p>If the scripting context <em>is</em> secure, then the <code
  title="dom-StorageItem-secure">secure</code> attribute must return
  true if the key/value pair is considered "safe only for secure
  content", and false if it is considered "safe for both secure and
  insecure content". If it is set to true, then the key/value pair
  must be flagged as "safe only for secure content". If it is set to
  false, then the key/value pair must be flagged as "safe for both
  secure and insecure content".</p>

  <p>If a <code>StorageItem</code> object is obtained by a script that
  is not running in a <span title="secure scripting contexts">secure
  scripting context</span>, and the item is then marked with the "safe
  only for secure content" flag by a script that <em>is</em> running
  in a secure context, the <code>StorageItem</code> object must
  continue to be available to the first script, who will be able to
  read the value of the object. However, any attempt to <em>set</em>
  the value would then start raising exceptions as described in the
  previous section, and the key/value pair would no longer appear in
  the appropriate <code>Storage</code> object.</p>


  <h4>The <code title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> attribute</h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-sessionStorage"><code>sessionStorage</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the storage area specific to the current
  <span>top-level browsing context</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>top-level browsing context</span> has a unique set of
  session storage areas, one for each domain.</p>

  <p>User agents should not expire data from a browsing context's
  session storage areas, but may do so when the user requests that
  such data be deleted, or when the UA detects that it has limited
  storage space, or for security reasons. User agents should always
  avoid deleting data while a script that could access that data is
  running. When a top-level browsing context is destroyed (and
  therefore permanently inaccessible to the user) the data stored in
  its session storage areas can be discarded with it, as the API
  described in this specification provides no way for that data to
  ever be subsequently retrieved.</p>

  <p class="note">The lifetime of a browsing context can be unrelated
  to the lifetime of the actual user agent process itself, as the user
  agent may support resuming sessions after a restart.</p>

  <p>When a new <code>HTMLDocument</code> is created, the user agent
  must check to see if the document's <span>top-level browsing
  context</span> has allocated a session storage area for that
  <span>document's domain</span>. If it has not, a new storage area
  for that document's domain must be created.</p>

  <p>The <code>Storage</code> object for the document's associated
  <code>Window</code> object's <code
  title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> attribute must then
  be associated with the domain's session storage area.</p>

  <p>When a new <span>top-level browsing context</span> is created by
  cloning an existing <span>browsing context</span>, the new browsing
  context must start with the same session storage areas as the
  original, but the two sets must from that point on be considered
  separate, not affecting each other in any way.</p>

  <p>When a new <span>top-level browsing context</span> is created by
  a script in an existing <span>browsing context</span>, or by the
  user following a link in an existing browsing context, or in some
  other way related to a specific <code>HTMLDocument</code>, then,
  if the new context's first <code>HTMLDocument</code> has the same
  <span title="document's domain">domain</span> as the
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> from which the new context was created,
  the new browsing context must start with a single session storage
  area. That storage area must be a copy of that domain's session
  storage area in the original browsing context, which from that point
  on must be considered separate, with the two storage areas not
  affecting each other in any way.</p>

  <!-- XXX define the case for window.open() -->

  <p id="sessionStorageEvent">When the <code
  title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> method is called on a
  <code>Storage</code> object <var title="">x</var> that is associated
  with a session storage area, then, if the method does not raise a
  <span>security exception</span>, in every <code>HTMLDocument</code>
  object whose <code>Window</code> object's <code
  title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> attribute's
  <code>Storage</code> object is associated with the same storage
  area, other than <var title="">x</var>, a <code
  title="event-storage">storage</code> event must be fired, as <span
  title="event-storage">described below</span>.</p>


  <h4>The <code title="dom-globalStorage">globalStorage</code> attribute</h4>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>StorageList</dfn> {
  <span>Storage</span> <span title="dom-Storagelist-namedItem">namedItem</span>(in DOMString domain);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-globalStorage"><code>globalStorage</code></dfn>
  object provides a <code>Storage</code> object for each domain.</p>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, <code>StorageList</code> objects must
  support dereferencing such that getting a property that is not a
  member of the object (i.e. is neither a member of the
  <code>StorageList</code> interface nor of <code>Object</code>) must
  invoke the <code title="dom-Storagelist-namedItem">namedItem()</code>
  method with the property's name as the argument.</p>

  <p>User agents must have a set of global storage areas, one for each
  domain.</p>

  <p>User agents should only expire data from the global storage areas
  for security reasons or when requested to do so by the user. User
  agents should always avoid deleting data while a script that could
  access that data is running. Data stored in global storage areas
  should be considered potentially user-critical. It is expected that
  Web applications will use the global storage areas for storing
  user-written documents.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storagelist-namedItem"><code>namedItem(<var
  title="">domain</var>)</code></dfn> method tries to returns a
  <code>Storage</code> object associated with the given domain,
  according to the rules that follow.</p>

  <div id="splitDomain">

   <p>The <var title="">domain</var> must first be split into an array
   of strings, by splitting the string at "." characters (U+002E FULL
   STOP). If the <var title="">domain</var> argument is the empty
   string, then the array is empty as well. If the <var
   title="">domain</var> argument is not empty but has no dots, then
   the array has one item, which is equal to the <var
   title="">domain</var> argument. If the <var title="">domain</var>
   argument contains consecutive dots, there will be empty strings in
   the array (e.g. the string "hello..world" becomes split into the
   three strings "hello", "", and "world", with the middle one being
   the empty string).</p>

   <p>Each component of the array must then have the IDNA ToASCII
   algorithm applied to it, with both the AllowUnassigned and
   UseSTD3ASCIIRules flags set. <a href="#refsRFC3490">[RFC3490]</a>
   If ToASCII fails to convert one of the components of the string,
   e.g. because it is too long or because it contains invalid
   characters, then the user agent must raise a
   <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception. <a
   href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a> The components after this step
   consist of only US-ASCII characters.</p>

   <p>The components of the array must then be converted to lowercase.
   Since only US-ASCII is involved at this step, this only requires
   converting characters in the range A-Z to the corresponding
   characters in the range a-z.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The resulting array is used in a comparison with another array,
  as described below. In addition, its components are concatenated
  together, each part separated by a dot (U+002E), to form the
  <dfn>normalised requested domain</dfn>.</p>

  <p class="example">If the original <var title="">domain</var> was
  "&Aring;sg&aring;rd.Example.Com", then the resulting array would
  have the three items "xn--sgrd-poac", "example", and "com", and the
  normalised requested domain would be
  "xn--sgrd-poac.example.com".</p>

  <p>Next, the <span title="script's domain">script's own
  domain</span> is processed to find if it is allowed to access the
  requested domain.</p>

  <p>If the script's domain name in not known, e.g. if only the
  server's IP address is known, and the <span>normalised requested
  domain</span> is not the empty string, then the user agent must
  raise a <span>security exception</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">If the <span>normalised requested domain</span> is
  the empty string, then the rest of this algorithm can be skipped.
  This is because in that situation, the comparison of the two arrays
  below will always find them to be the same &mdash; the first array
  in such a situation is also empty and so permission to access that
  storage area will always be given.</p>

  <p>If the script's domain contains no dots (U+002E) then the string
  "<code>.localdomain</code>" must be appended to the script's
  domain.</p>

  <p>Then, the script's domain must be turned into an array, being
  split, converted to ASCII, and lowercased as described for the <var
  title="">domain</var> argument <a href="#splitDomain">above</a>.</p>

  <p>Of the two arrays, the longest one must then be shortened to the
  length of the shorter one, by dropping items from the start of the
  array.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>If the <var title="">domain</var> argument is "www.example.com"
   and the script's domain is "example.com" then the first array will be
   a three item array ("www", "example", "com"), and the second will
   be a two item array ("example", "com"). The first array is
   therefore shortened, dropping the leading parts, making both into
   the same array ("example", "com").</p>

  </div>

  <p>If the two arrays are not component-for-component identical in
  literal string comparisons, then the user agent must then raise a
  <span>security exception</span>.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the user agent must check to see if it has allocated
  global storage area for the <span>normalised requested
  domain</span>. If it has not, a new storage area for that domain
  must be created.</p>

  <p>The user agent must then create a <code>Storage</code> object
  associated with that domain's global storage area, and return
  it.</p>

  <p>When the requested <var title="">domain</var> is a top level
  domain, or the empty string, or a country-specific sub-domain like
  "co.uk" or "ca.us", the associated global storage area is known as
  <dfn>public storage area</dfn></p>

  <div id="globalStorageEvent">

   <p>The <code title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> method
   might be called on a <code>Storage</code> object that is associated
   with a global storage area for a domain <var title="">d</var>,
   created by a <code>StorageList</code> object associated with a
   <code>Window</code> object <var title="">x</var>. Whenever this
   occurs, if the method didn't raise an exception, a <code
   title="event-storage">storage</code> event must be fired, as
   described below, in every <code>HTMLDocument</code> object that
   matches the following conditions:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>Its <code>Window</code> object is not <var title="">x</var>, and</li>

    <li>Its <code>Window</code> object's <code
    title="dom-sessionStorage">globalStorage</code> attribute's
    <code>StorageList</code> object's <code
    title="dom-Storagelist-namedItem">namedItem()</code> method would not
    raise a <span>security exception</span> according to the rules above if it was
    invoked with the domain <var title="">d</var>.</li>

   </ul>

   <p>In other words, every other document that has access to that
   domain's global storage area is notified of the change.</p>

  </div>


  <h4>The <code title="event-storage">storage</code> event</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-storage"><code>storage</code></dfn> event
  is fired in an <code>HTMLDocument</code> when a storage area
  changes, as described in the previous two sections (<a
  href="#sessionStorageEvent">for session storage</a>, <a
  href="#globalStorageEvent">for global storage</a>).</p>

  <p>When this happens, a <code>storage</code> event in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code> namespace, which
  bubbles, is not cancelable, has no default action, and which uses
  the <code>StorageEvent</code> interface described below, must be
  fired on <span>the body element</span>.</p>

  <p>However, it is possible (indeed, for session storage areas,
  likely) that the target <code>HTMLDocument</code> object is not
  active at that time. For example, it might not be the <span>current
  entry</span> in the session history; user agents typically stop
  scripts from running in pages that are in the history. In such
  cases, the user agent must instead delay the firing of the event
  until such time as the <code>HTMLDocument</code> object in
  question becomes active again.</p>

  <p>When there are multiple delayed <code>storage</code> events for
  the same <code>HTMLDocument</code> object, user agents should
  coalesce events with the same <code
  title="dom-Storageevent-domain">domain</code> value (dropping
  duplicates).</p>

  <p>If the DOM of a page that has delayed <code>storage</code> events
  queued up is <span title="discard">discarded</span>, then the
  delayed events are dropped as well.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>StorageEvent</dfn> : Event {
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-StorageEvent-domain">domain</span>;
  void <span title="dom-StorageEvent-initStorageEvent">initStorageEvent</span>(in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMString domainArg);
  void <span title="dom-StorageEvent-initStorageEventNS">initStorageEventNS</span>(in DOMString namespaceURIArg, in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMString domainArg);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-StorageEvent-initStorageEvent"><code>initStorageEvent()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn
  title="dom-StorageEvent-initStorageEventNS"><code>initStorageEventNS()</code></dfn>
  methods must initialise the event in a manner analogous to the
  similarly-named methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a
  href="#DOM3Events">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-StorageEvent-domain"><code>domain</code></dfn> attribute
  of the <code>StorageEvent</code> event object must be set to the
  name of the domain associated with the storage area that changed if
  that storage area is a global storage area, or the string
  "<code>#session</code>" if it was a session storage area.</p>

  <!-- XXX onstorage should be defined -->


  <h4>Miscellaneous implementation requirements for storage areas</h4>

  <h5>Disk space</h5>

  <p>User agents should limit the total amount of space allowed for a
  domain based on the domain of the page setting the value.</p>

  <p>User agents should not limit the total amount of space allowed on
  a per-storage-area basis, otherwise a site could just store data in
  any number of subdomains, e.g. storing up to the limit in
  a1.example.com, a2.example.com, a3.example.com, etc, circumventing
  per-domain limits.</p>

  <p>User agents should consider additional quota mechanisms (for
  example limiting the amount of space provided to a domain's
  subdomains as a group) so that hostile authors can't run scripts
  from multiple subdomains all adding data to the global storage area
  in an attempted denial-of-service attack.</p>

  <p>User agents may prompt the user when per-domain space quotas are
  reached, allowing the user to grant a site more space. This enables
  sites to store many user-created documents on the user's computer,
  for instance.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow users to see how much space each domain
  is using.</p>

  <p>If the storage area space limit is reached during a <code
  title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> call, the user agent
  should raise an exception.</p> <!-- XXX which one? -->

  <p>A mostly arbitrary limit of five megabytes per domain is
  recommended. Implementation feedback is welcome and will be used to
  update this suggestion in future.</p>


  <h5>Threads</h5>

  <p>Multiple browsing contexts must be able to access the global
  storage areas simultaneously in a predictable manner. Scripts must
  not be able to detect any concurrent script execution.</p>

  <p>This is required to guarentee that the <code
  title="dom-Storage-length">length</code> attribute of a
  <code>Storage</code> object never changes while a script is
  executing, other than in a way that is predictable by the script
  itself.</p>

  <p>There are various ways of implementing this requirement. One is
  that if a script running in one browsing context accesses a global
  storage area, the UA blocks scripts in other browsing contexts when
  they try to access <em>any</em> global storage area until the first
  script has executed to completion. (Similarly, when a script in one
  browsing context accesses its session storage area, any scripts that
  have the same top level browsing context and the same domain would
  block when accessing their session storage area until the first
  script has executed to completion.) Another (potentially more
  efficient but probably more complex) implementation strategy is to
  use optimistic transactional script execution. This specification
  does not require any particular implementation strategy, so long as
  the requirement above is met.</p>


  <h4>Security and privacy</h4>

  <h5>User tracking</h5>

  <p>A third-party advertiser (or any entity capable of getting
  content distributed to multiple sites) could use a unique identifier
  stored in its domain's global storage area to track a user across
  multiple sessions, building a profile of the user's interests to
  allow for highly targetted advertising. In conjunction with a site
  that is aware of the user's real identity (for example an e-commerce
  site that requires authenticated credentials), this could allow
  oppressive groups to target individuals with greater accuracy than
  in a world with purely anonymous Web usage.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-globalStorage">globalStorage</code> object
  also introduces a way for sites to cooperate to track users over
  multiple domains, by storing identifying data in "<span
  title="public storage area">public</span>" top-level domain storage
  area, accessible by any domain.</p>

  <p>There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate the
  risk of user tracking:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>

    <p>Blocking third-party storage: user agents may restrict access
    to the <code title="dom-globalStorage">globalStorage</code> object
    to scripts originating at the domain of the top-level document of
    the <span>browsing context</span>.</p>

    <p>This blocks a third-party site from using its private storage
    area for tracking a user, but top-level sites could still
    cooperate with third parties to perferm user tracking by using the
    "<span title="public storage area">public</span>" storage area.</p>

   </li>
 
   <li>

    <p>Expiring stored data: user agents may automatically delete
    stored data after a period of time.</p>

    <p>For example, a user agent could treat the global storage area
    as session-only storage, deleting the data once the user had
    closed all the <span>browsing contexts</span> that could access
    it.</p>

    <p>This can restrict the ability of a site to track a user, as the
    site would then only be able to track the user across multiple
    sessions when he authenticates with the site itself (e.g. by
    making a purchase or logging in to a service).</p>

    <!-- XXX should there be an explicit way for sites to state when
    data should expire? as in
    globalStorage['example.com'].expireData(365); ? -->

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Blocking access to the top-level domain ("<span title="public storage area">public</span>") storage
    areas: user agents may prevent domains from storing data in and
    reading data from the top-level domain entries in the <code
    title="dom-globalStorage">globalStorage</code> object.</p>

    <p>In practice this requires a detailed list of all the "public"
    second-level (and third-level) domains. For example, content at
    the domain <code>www.example.com</code> would be allowed to access
    <code>example.com</code> data but not <code>com</code> data;
    content at the domain <code>example.co.uk</code> would be allowed
    access to <code>example.co.uk</code> but not <code>co.uk</code> or
    <code>uk</code>; and content at
    <code>example.chiyoda.tokyo.jp</code> would be allowed access to
    <code>example.chiyoda.tokyo.jp</code> but not
    <code>chiyoda.tokyo.jp</code>, <code>tokyo.jp</code>, or
    <code>jp</code>, while content at
    <code>example.metro.tokyo.jp</code> would be allowed access to
    both <code>example.metro.tokyo.jp</code> and
    <code>metro.tokyo.jp</code> but not <code>tokyo.jp</code> or
    <code>jp</code>. The problem is even more convoluted when one
    considers private domains with third-party subdomains such as
    <code>dyndns.org</code> or <code>uk.com</code>.</p>

    <p>Blocking access to the "<span title="public storage area">public</span>" storage areas can also prevent
    innocent sites from cooperating to provide services beneficial to
    the user.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Treating persistent storage as cookies: user agents may present
    the persistent storage feature to the user in a way that does not
    distinguish it from HTTP session cookies. <a
    href="#refsRFC2965">[RFC2965]</a></p>

    <p>This might encourage users to view persistent storage with
    healthy suspicion.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Site-specific white-listing of access to "<span title="public storage area">public</span>" storage
    area: user agents may allow sites to access persistent storage
    for their own domain and subdomains in an unrestricted manner, but
    require the user to authorise access to the storage area of
    higher-level domains.</p>

    <p>For example, code at <code>example.com</code> would be always
    allowed to read and write data for <code>www.example.com</code>
    and <code>example.com</code>, but if it tried to access
    <code>com</code>, the user agent could display a non-modal message
    informing the user that the page requested access to
    <code>com</code> and offering to allow it.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Origin-tracking of persistent storage data: user agents may
    record the domain of the script that caused data to be stored.</p>

    <p>If this information is then used to present the view of data
    currently in persistent storage, it would allow the user to make
    informed decisions about which parts of the persistent storage to
    prune. Combined with a blacklist ("delete this data and prevent
    this domain from ever storing data again"), the user can restrict
    the use of persistent storage to sites that he trusts.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Shared blacklists: user agents may allow users to share their
    persistent storage domain blacklists.</p>

    <p>This would allow communities to act together to protect their
    privacy.</p>

   </li>

  </ul>

  <p>While these suggestions prevent trivial use of this API for user
  tracking, they do not block it altogether. Within a single domain, a
  site can continue to track the user across multiple sessions, and
  can then pass all this information to the third party along with any
  identifying information (names, credit card numbers, addresses)
  obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with multiple
  sites to obtain such information, a profile can still be created.</p>

  <p>However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no
  cooperation from the user agent whatsoever, for instance by using
  session identifiers in URIs, a technique already commonly used for
  innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even
  retroactively). This information can then be shared with other
  sites, using using visitors' IP addresses and other user-specific
  data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine
  separate sessions into coherent user profiles.</p>

  <h5>Cookie resurrection</h5>

  <p>If the user interface for persistent storage presents data in the
  persistent storage feature separately from data in HTTP session
  cookies, then users are likely to delete data in one and not the
  other. This would allow sites to use the two features as redundant
  backup for each other, defeating a user's attempts to protect his
  privacy.</p>

  <h5>Integrity of "public" storage areas</h5>

  <p>Since the "<span title="public storage area">public</span>" global storage areas are accessible by content
  from many different parties, it is possible for third-party sites to
  delete or change information stored in those areas in ways that the
  originating sites may not expect.</p>

  <p>Authors must not use the "<span title="public storage area">public</span>" global storage areas for
  storing sensitive data. Authors must not trust information stored in
  "<span title="public storage area">public</span>" global storage areas.</p>

  <h5>Cross-protocol and cross-port attacks</h5>

  <p>This API makes no distinction between content served over HTTP,
  FTP, or other host-based protocols, and does not distinguish between
  content served from different ports at the same host.</p>

  <p>Thus, for example, data stored in the global persistent storage
  for domain "www.example.com" by a page served from HTTP port 80 will
  be available to a  page served in
  <code>http://example.com:18080/</code>, even if the latter is an
  experimental server under the control of a different user.</p>

  <p>Since the data is not sent over the wire by the user agent, this
  is not a security risk in its own right. However, authors must take
  proper steps to ensure that all hosts that have fully qualified host
  names that are subsets of hosts dealing with sensitive information
  are as secure as the originating hosts themselves.</p>

  <p>Similarly, authors must ensure that all Web servers on a host,
  regardless of the port, are equally trusted if any of them are to
  use persistent storage. For instance, if a Web server runs a
  production service that makes use of the persistent storage feature,
  then other users that have access to that machine and that can run a
  Web server on another port will be able to access the persistent
  storage added by the production service (assuming they can trick a
  user into visiting their page).</p>

  <p>However, if one is able to trick users into visiting a Web server
  with the same host name but on a different port as a production
  service used by these users, then one could just as easily fake the
  look of the site and thus trick users into authenticating with the
  fake site directly, forwarding the request to the real site and
  stealing the credentials in the process. Thus, the persistent
  storage feature is considered to only minimally increase the
  risk involved.</p>

  <h5>DNS spoofing attacks</h5>

  <p>Because of the potential for DNS spoofing attacks, one cannot
  guarentee that a host claiming to be in a certain domain really is
  from that domain. The <code
  title="dom-StorageItem-secure">secure</code> attribute is provided
  to mark certain key/value pairs as only being accessible to pages
  that have been authenticated using secure certificates (or similar
  mechanisms).</p>

  <p>Authors must ensure that they do not mark sensitive items as
  "safe for both secure and insecure content". (To prevent the risk of
  a race condition, data stored by scripts in secure contexts default
  to being marked as "safe only for secure content".)</p>

  <h5>Cross-directory attacks</h5>

  <p>Different authors sharing one host name, for example users
  hosting content on <code>geocities.com</code>, all share one
  persistent storage object. There is no feature to restrict the
  access by pathname. Authors on shared hosts are therefore
  recommended to avoid using the persistent storage feature, as it
  would be trivial for other authors to read from and write to the
  same storage area.</p>

  <p class="note">Even if a path-restriction feature was made
  available, the usual DOM scripting security model would make it
  trivial to bypass this protection and access the data from any
  path.</p>


  <h5>Public storage areas corresponding to hosts</h5>

  <p>If a "<span title="public storage area">public</span>" global
  storage area corresponds to a host, as it typically does if for
  private domains with third-party subdomains such as dyndns.org or
  uk.com, the host corresponding to the "public" domain has access to
  all the storage areas of its third-party subdomains. In general,
  authors are discouraged from using the <code
  title="dom-globalStorage">globalStorage</code> API for sensitive
  data unless the operators of all the domains involved are
  trusted.</p>

  <p>User agents may mitigate this problem by preventing hosts
  corresponding to "<span title="public storage area">public</span>"
  global storage areas from accessing any storage areas other than
  their own.</p>


  <h5>Storage areas in the face of untrusted higher-level domains that do not correspond to public storage areas</h5>

  <p>Authors should not store sensitive data using the global storage
  APIs if there are hosts with fully-qualified domain names that are
  subsets of their own which they do not trust. For example, an author
  at <code>finance.members.example.net</code> should not store
  sensitive financial user data in the
  <code>finance.members.example.net</code> storage area if he does not
  trust the host that runs <code>example.net</code>.</p>


  <h5>Storage areas in the face of untrusted subdomains</h5>

  <p>If an author publishing content on one host,
  e.g. <code>example.com</code>, wishes to use the <code
  title="dom-globalStorage">globalStorage</code> API but does not wish
  any content on the host's subdomains to access the data, the author
  should use an otherwise non-existent subdomain name, e.g.,
  <code>private.example.com</code>, to store the data. This will be
  accessible only to that host (and its parent domains), and not to
  any of the real subdomains
  (e.g. <code>upload.example.com</code>).</p>


  <h5>Implementation risks</h5>

  <p>The two primary risks when implementing this persistent storage
  feature are letting hostile sites read information from other
  domains, and letting hostile sites write information that is then
  read from other domains.</p>

  <p>Letting third-party sites read data that is not supposed to be
  read from their domain causes <em>information leakage</em>, For
  example, a user's shopping wishlist on one domain could be used by
  another domain for targetted advertising; or a user's
  work-in-progress confidential documents stored by a word-processing
  site could be examined by the site of a competing company.</p>

  <p>Letting third-party sites write data to the storage areas of
  other domains can result in <em>information spoofing</em>, which is
  equally dangerous. For example, a hostile site could add items to a
  user's wishlist; or a hostile site could set a user's session
  identifier to a known ID that the hostile site can then use to track
  the user's actions on the victim site.</p>

  <p>A risk is also presented by servers on local domains having
  host names matching top-level domain names, for instance having a
  host called "com" or "net". Such hosts might, if implementations
  fail to correctly implement the <code>.localdomain</code> suffixing,
  <!-- XXX cross ref --> have full access to all the data stored in a
  UA's persistent storage for that top level domain.</p>

  <p>Thus, strictly following the model described in this
  specification is important for user security.</p>

  <p>In addition, a number of optional restrictions related to the
  "<span title="public storage area">public</span>" global storage
  areas are suggested in the previous sections. The design of this API
  is intended to be such that not supporting these restrictions, or
  supporting them less than perfectly, does not result in critical
  security problems. However, implementations are still encouraged to
  create and maintain a list of "<span title="public storage
  area">public</span>" domains, and apply the restrictions described
  above.</p>



  <h2 id="editing"><dfn>Editing</dfn></h2>

  <p>This section describes various features that allow authors to
  enable users to edit documents and parts of documents
  interactively.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p class="big-issue">Would be nice to explain how these features
  work together.</p>


  <h3 id="contenteditable"><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span>The <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute</h3>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-contenteditable"><code>contenteditable</code></dfn>
  attribute is a common attribute. User agents must support this
  attribute on all <span>HTML elements</span>.</p> <!-- XXX define it
  in the appropriate place then -->

  <p>If an HTML element has a <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set to
  the empty string or the value <code>true</code> (by
  <span>case-insensitive match</span><!--XXX xref-->), or if its
  nearest ancestor with the <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set
  has its attribute set to the empty string or the value
  <code>true</code> (by <span>case-insensitive match</span><!--XXX
  xref-->), then the UA must treat the element as <dfn>editable</dfn>
  (as described below).</p> <!-- XXX case-sensitivity in HTML -->

  <p>If an HTML element has a <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set
  but the value of the attribute is not the empty string or the
  literal value <code>true</code>, or if its nearest ancestor with the
  <code title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute
  set is not <em>editable</em>, or if it has no ancestor with the
  <code title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute
  set, then the element is not editable.</p>

  <p>Authors must only use the exact literal values <code>true</code>
  and <code>false</code> with the <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">The <dfn
  title="dom-contentEditable"><code>contentEditable</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute...</p><!-- is a string that accepts "true", "false",
  "inherit", case-insensitively, and sets the content attribute to
  "true", "false", or removes it, respectively, and raises an
  exception otherwise -->

  <p>If an element is <span>editable</span> and its parent element is
  not, then the element is an <dfn>editing host</dfn>. Editable
  elements can be nested. User agents must make editing hosts
  focusable (which typicially means they enter the <span
  title="tabindex">tab order</span>). An editing host can contain
  non-editable sections, these are handled as described below. An
  editing host can contain non-editable sections that contain further
  editing hosts.</p>

  <p>When an editing host has focus, it must have a <dfn>caret
  position</dfn> that specifies where the current editing position
  is. It may also have a <span title="the selection">selection</span>.</p> <!--- XXX xref to later section -->

  <p class="note">How the caret and selection are represented depends
  entirely on the UA.</p>

  <!-- XXX rendering requirement: The current caret should affect the
  line-height (i.e. it acts at least like an empty inline element) -->

<!-- XXX document.designMode attribute -->


  <h4>User editing actions</h4>

  <p>There are several actions that the user agent should allow the
  user to perform while the user is interacting with an editing
  host. How exactly each action is triggered is not defined for every
  action, but when it is not defined, suggested key bindings are
  provided to guide implementors.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Move the caret</dt>

   <dd><p>User agents must allow users to move the caret to any
   position within an editing host, even into nested editable
   elements. This could be triggered as the default action of <code
   title="event-keydown">keydown</code> events with various key
   identifiers and as the default action of <code
   title="event-mousedown">mouseydown</code> events.</p></dd>


   <dt>Change the selection</dt>

   <dd><p>User agents must allow users to change <span>the
   selection</span> within an editing host, even into nested editable
   elements. This could be triggered as the default action of <code
   title="event-keydown">keydown</code> events with various key
   identifiers and as the default action of <code
   title="event-mousedown">mouseydown</code> events.</p></dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-insertText">Insert text</dt>

   <dd><p>This action must be triggered as the default action of a
   <code title="event-textInput">textInput</code> event, and may be
   triggered by other commands as well. It must cause the user agent
   to insert the specified text (given by the event object's <code
   title="">data</code> attribute in the case of the <code
   title="event-textInput">textInput</code> event) at the caret.</p>

   <p>If the caret is positioned somewhere where <span>inline-level
   content</span> is not allowed (e.g. because the element accepts
   "both block-level and inline-level content but not both", and the
   element already contains block-level content), then the user agent
   must not insert the text directly at the caret position. In such
   cases the behaviour is UA-dependent, but user agents must not, in
   response to a request to insert text, generate a DOM that is less
   conformant than the DOM prior to the request.</p>

   <p>User agents should allow users to insert new paragraphs into
   elements that only contain block-level content.</p>

   <div class="example">
    <p>For example, given the markup:</p>
    <pre>&lt;section&gt;
 &lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt; Ben &lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt; Goat &lt;/dd&gt;
 &lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>
    <p>...the user agent should allow the user to insert
    <code>p</code> elements before and after the <code>dl</code>
    element, as children of the <code>section</code> element.</p>
   </div>

   </dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-breakBlock">Break block</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer a way for the user to request that the
   current block be broken at the caret, e.g. as the default action of
   a <code title="event-keydown">keydown</code> event whose identifier
   is the "Enter" key and that has no modifiers set.</p>

   <p>The exact behaviour is UA-dependent, but user agents must not,
   in response to a request to break a block, generate a DOM that is
   less conformant than the DOM prior to the request.</p></dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-br">Insert a line separator</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer a way for the user to request an explicit
   line break at the caret position without breaking the block, for
   example as in a poem verse or an address. To insert a line break,
   the user agent must insert a <code>br</code> element.</p>

   <p>If the caret is positioned somewhere where <span>inline-level
   content</span> is not allowed (e.g. because the element accepts
   "both block-level and inline-level content but not both", and the
   element already contains block-level content), then the user agent
   must not insert the <code>br</code> element directly at the caret
   position. In such cases the behaviour is UA-dependent, but user
   agents must not, in response to a request to insert a line
   separator, generate a DOM that is less conformant than the DOM
   prior to the request.</p></dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-delete">Delete</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer a way for the user to delete text and
   elements, e.g. as the default action of <code
   title="event-keydown">keydown</code> events whose identifiers are
   "U+0008" or "U+007F".</p>

   <p>Five edge cases in particular need to be considered carefully
   when implementing this feature: backspacing at the start of an
   element, backspacing when the caret is immediately after an
   element, forward-deleting at the end of an element,
   forward-deleting when the caret is immediately before an element,
   and deleting a <span title="the selection">selection</span> whose
   start and end points do not share a common parent node.</p>

   <p>In any case, the exact behaviour is UA-dependent, but user
   agents must not, in response to a request to delete text or an
   element, generate a DOM that is less conformant than the DOM prior
   to the request.</p></dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-wrapSemantic">Insert, and wrap text in,
   semantic elements</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer a way for the user to mark text as having
   <span title="em">stress emphasis</span> and as being <span
   title="strong">important</span>, and may offer the user the ability
   to mark text and blocks with other semantics.</p>

   <p>UAs should similarly offer a way for the user to insert empty
   semantic elements (such as, again, <code>em</code>,
   <code>strong</code>, and others) to subsequently fill by entering
   text manually.</p>

   <p>UAs should also offer a way to remove those semantics from
   marked up text, and to remove empty semantic element that have been
   inserted.</p>

   <p>The exact behaviour is UA-dependent, but user agents must not,
   in response to a request to wrap semantics around some text or to
   insert or remove a semantic element, generate a DOM that is less
   conformant than the DOM prior to the request.</p></dd>


   <dt>Select and move non-editable elements nested inside editing hosts</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer a way for the user to move images and other
   non-editable parts around the content within an editing host. This
   may be done using the <span>drag and drop</span> mechanism. User
   agents must not, in response to a request to move non-editable
   elements nested inside editing hosts, generate a DOM that is less

   <dt>Edit form controls nested inside editing hosts</dt>

   <dd><p>When an <span>editable</span> form control is edited, the

   well as the <code title="dom-input-value">value</code> DOM
   attribute; for <code>select</code> elements it means updating the
   <code>option</code> elements' <code
   title="dom-option-defaultSelected">defaultSelected</code> DOM
   attribute as well as the <code
   title="dom-option-selected">selected</code> DOM attribute; for
   <code>textarea</code> elements this means updating the <code

  <!-- XXX each action performed should be added to the undo history -->

  <p>User agents may perform several commands per user request; for
  example if the user selects a block of text and hits

  by a request to break the block at that position.</p>


  <h4>Making entire documents editable</h4>

  <p class="big-issue">This section will define document.<dfn
  title="dom-document-designMode"><code>designMode</code></dfn>.</p>



  <h3>Focus <span title="WIP">[WIP]</span></h3>

  <p class="big-issue">This entire section will be merged with earlier
  sections in due course.</p>

  <p>When an element is focused, key events are targetted at that
  element instead of at the document's root element.</p>

  <h4>The <dfn><code>tabindex</code></dfn> Attribute</h4>

  <p class="issue">This section on the <code>tabindex</code> attribute
  needs to be checked for backwards-compatibility.</p>

  <p>The <code>tabindex</code> attribute defined in HTML4 is extended
  to apply to all <span>HTML elements</span> by defining it as a
  common attribute.</p>

  <p>The <code>tabindex</code> attribute specifies the relative order
  of elements for the purposes of sequential focus navigation. The
  name "tab index" comes from the common use of the "tab" key to
  navigate through the focusable elements. The term "tabbing" refers
  to moving forward through the focusable elements.</p>

  <p>The <code>tabindex</code> attribute can take any integer (an
  optional U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS representing negativity followed by one
  or more digits in the range 0-9, U+0030 to U+0039, interpreted as
  base ten).</p>

  <p>A positive integer (including zero) specifies the index of the
  element in the current scope's tab order. Elements with the same
  index are sorted in <span>tree order</span> for the purposes of tabbing.</p>

  <p id="negative-tabindex">A negative integer specifies that the
  element should be removed from the tab order. If the element does
  normally take focus, it may still be focused using other means (e.g.
  it could be focussed by a click).</p>

  <p>Other values are ignored, as if the attribute was absent. Certain
  elements may default absent <code>tabindex</code> attributes to
  zero, at the user agent's discretion. (In other words, some elements
  are focusable by default, and they are assumed to have tab index 0.
  Text fields will typically be in the tab order by default, for
  instance.)</p>

  <p>When an element that does not normally take focus has the
  <code>tabindex</code> attribute specified with a positive value,
  then it is added to the tab order and is made focusable. When
  focused, the element matches the CSS <code>:focus</code>
  pseudo-class and key events are dispatched on that element when
  appropriate, just like focusing a link.</p>

  <p>Since all <span>HTML elements</span> can thus be focused and
  unfocusd, the <code>onfocus</code> and <code>onblur</code>
  attributes shall also apply to all HTML elements.</p>

  <h4>The <dfn><code>ElementFocus</code></dfn> interface</h4>

  <p>The <code>ElementFocus</code> interface contains methods for
  moving focus to and from an element. It can be obtained from objects
  that implement the <code>Element</code> interface using
  binding-specific casting methods.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>ElementFocus</dfn> {
           attribute long                    tabIndex;
  void focus();
  void blur();
};</pre>

  <p>The <code>tabIndex</code> DOM attribute reflects the value of the
  related content attribute. If the attribute is not present (or has
  an invalid value) then the DOM attribute should return the UA's
  default value for that element, typically either 0 (for elements in
  the tab order) or -1 (for elements not in the tab order).</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>focus()</code></dfn> and
  <dfn><code>blur()</code></dfn> methods focus and unfocus the element
  respectively, if the element is focusable.</p>

  <h4>The <dfn><code>DocumentFocus</code></dfn> interface</h4>

  <p>The <code>DocumentFocus</code> interface contains methods for
  moving focus around the document. It can be obtained from objects
  that implement the <code>Document</code> interface using
  binding-specific casting methods.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>DocumentFocus</dfn> {
  readonly attribute Element                 currentFocus;
  void moveFocusForward();
  void moveFocusBackward();
  void moveFocusUp();
  void moveFocusRight();
  void moveFocusDown();
  void moveFocusLeft();
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn><code>currentFocus</code></dfn> attribute returns the
  element to which key events will be sent when the document receives
  key events.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>moveFocusForward</code></dfn> method uses the
  <code>'nav-index'</code> property and the <code>tabindex</code>
  attribute to find the next focusable element and focuses it.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>moveFocusBackward</code></dfn> method uses the
  <code>'nav-index'</code> property and the <code>tabindex</code>
  attribute to find the previous focusable element and focuses
  it.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>moveFocusUp</code></dfn> method uses the
  <code>'nav-up'</code> property and the <code>tabindex</code>
  attribute to find an appropriate focusable element and focuses
  it.</p>

  <p>In a similar manner, the <dfn><code>moveFocusRight</code></dfn>,
  <dfn><code>moveFocusDown</code></dfn>, and
  <dfn><code>moveFocusLeft</code></dfn> methods use the
  <code>'nav-right'</code>, <code>'nav-down'</code>, and
  <code>'nav-left'</code> properties (respectively), and the
  <code>tabindex</code> attribute, to find an appropriate focusable
  element and focus it.</p>

  <p>The <code>'nav-index'</code>, <code>'nav-up'</code>,
  <code>'nav-right'</code>, <code>'nav-down'</code>, and
  <code>'nav-left'</code> properties are defined in <a
  href="#refsCSS3UI">[CSS3UI]</a>.</p>

  <p>This section defines an event-based drag-and-drop mechanism.</p>

  <p>This specification does not define exactly what a <em>drag and
  drop operation</em> actually is.</p>

  <p>On a visual medium with a pointing device, a drag operation could
  be the default action of a <code
  title="event-mousedown">mousedown</code> event that is followed by a
  series of <code title="event-mousemove">mousemove</code> events, and
  the drop could be triggered by the mouse being released.</p>

  <p>On media without a pointing device, the user would probably have
  to explicitly indicate his intention to perform a drag-and-drop
  operation, stating what he wishes to drag and what he wishes to
  drop, respectively.</p>

  <p>However it is implemented, drag and drop operations must have a
  starting point (e.g. where the mouse was clicked, or the start of
  <span>the selection</span> or element that was selected for the
  drag), may have any number of intermediate steps (elements that the
  mouse moves over during a drag, or elements that the user picks as
  possible drop points as he cycles through possibilities), and must
  either have an end point (the element above which the mouse button
  was released, or the element that was finally selected), or be
  canceled. The end point must be the last element selected as a
  possible drop point before the drop occurs (so if the operation is
  not canceled, there must be at least one element in the middle
  step).</p>


  <h4>The <code>DragEvent</code> and <code>DataTransfer</code> interfaces</h4>

  <p>The drag-and-drop processing model involves several events. They
  all use the <code>DragEvent</code> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>DragEvent</dfn> : Event {
  readonly attribute <span>DataTransfer</span> <span title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</span>;
  void <span title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEvent">initDragEvent</span>(in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg);
  void <span title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEventNS">initDragEventNS</span>(in DOMString namespaceURIArg, in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEvent"><code>initDragEvent()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn
  title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEventNS"><code>initDragEventNS()</code></dfn>
  methods must initialise the event in a manner analogous to the
  similarly-named methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a
  href="#DOM3Events">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer"><code>dataTransfer</code></dfn>
  attribute of the <code>DragEvent</code> interface represents the
  context information for the event.</p>

  <p>When a <code>DragEvent</code> object is created, a new
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object must be created and assigned to the
  <code title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code>
  context information field of the event object.</p>


  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>DataTransfer</dfn> {
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed">effectAllowed</span>;
  void <span title="dom-DataTransfer-clearData">clearData</span>(in DOMString format);
  void <span title="dom-DataTransfer-setData">setData</span>(in DOMString format, in DOMString data);
  DOMString <span title="dom-DataTransfer-getData">getData</span>(in DOMString format);
  void <span title="dom-DataTransfer-setDragImage">setDragImage</span>(in Element image, in long x, in long y);
  void <span title="dom-DataTransfer-addElement">addElement</span>(in Element element);
};
</pre>

  <p><code>DataTransfer</code> objects can conceptually contain
  various kinds of data.</p>

  <p>When a <code>DragEvent</code> event object is initialised, the
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object created for the event's <code
  title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> member must
  be initialised as follows:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The <code>DataTransfer</code> object must initially contain no
   data, no elements, and have no associated image.</li>

   <li>The <code>DataTransfer</code> object's <code
   title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed">effectAllowed</code>
   attribute must be set to "<code
   title="">uninitialized</code>".</li>

   <li>The <code title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code>
   attribute must be set to "<code title="">none</code>".</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect"><code>dropEffect</code></dfn>
  attribute controls the drag and drop feedback that the user is given
  during a drag and drop operation.</p>

  <p>The attribute must ignore any attempts to set it to a value other
  than <code title="">none</code>, <code title="">copy</code>, <code
  title="">link</code>, and <code title="">move</code>. On getting,
  the attribute must return the last of those four values that it was
  set to.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed"><code>effectAllowed</code></dfn>
  attribute is used in the drag and drop processing model to
  initialise the <code
  title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code> attribute
  during the <code title="event-dragenter">dragenter</code> and <code
  title="event-dragover">dragover</code> events.</p>

  <p>The attribute must ignore any attempts to set it to a value other
  than <code title="">none</code>, <code title="">copy</code>, <code
  title="">copyLink</code>, <code title="">copyMove</code>, <code
  title="">link</code>, <code title="">linkMove</code>, <code
  title="">move</code>, <code title="">all</code>, and <code
  title="">uninitialized</code>. On getting, the attribute must return
  the last of those values that it was set to.</p>

  <p><code>DataTransfer</code> objects can hold pieces of data, each
  associated with a unique format. Formats are generally given by MIME
  types, with some values special-cased for legacy reasons.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-DataTransfer-clearData"><code>clearData(<var
  title="">format</var>)</code></dfn> method must clear the
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object of any data associated with the
  given <var title="">format</var>. If <var title="">format</var> is
  the value "<code title="">Text</code>", then it must be treated as
  "<code title="">text/plain</code>". If the <var
  title="">format</var> is "<code title="">URL</code>", then it must
  be treated as "<code title="">text/uri-list</code>".</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-DataTransfer-setData"><code>setData(<var
  title="">format</var>, <var title="">data</var>)</code></dfn> method
  must add <var title="">data</var> to the data stored in the
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object, labelled as being of the type <var
  title="">format</var>. This must replace any previous data that had
  been set for that format. If <var title="">format</var> is the value
  "<code title="">Text</code>", then it must be treated as "<code
  title="">text/plain</code>". If the <var title="">format</var> is
  "<code title="">URL</code>", then it must be treated as "<code
  title="">text/uri-list</code>".</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-DataTransfer-getData"><code>getData(<var
  title="">format</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the data that
  is associated with the type <var title="">format</var>, if any, and
  must return the empty string otherwise. If <var
  title="">format</var> is the value "<code title="">Text</code>",
  then it must be treated as "<code title="">text/plain</code>". If
  the <var title="">format</var> is "<code title="">URL</code>", then
  the data associated with the "<code title="">text/uri-list</code>"
  format must be parsed as appropriate for <code
  title="">text/uri-list</code> data, and the first URI from the list
  must be returned. If there is no data with that format, or if there
  is but it has no URIs, then the method must return the empty
  string. <a href="#refsRFC2483">[RFC2483]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataTransfer-setDragImage"><code>setDragImage(<var
  title="">element</var>, <var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>)</code></dfn> method sets which element to use <a
  href="#base-dnd-feedback">to generate the drag feedback</a>. The
  <var title="">element</var> argument can be any
  <code>Element</code>; if it is an <code>img</code> element, then the
  user agent should use the element's image (at its intrinsic size) to
  generate the feedback, otherwise the user agent should base the
  feedback on the given element (but the exact mechanism for doing so
  is not specified).</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataTransfer-addElement"><code>addElement(<var
  title="">element</var>)</code></dfn> method is an alternative way of
  specifying how the user agent is to <a
  href="#base-dnd-feedback">render the drag feedback</a>. It adds an
  element to the <code>DataTransfer</code> object.</p>


  <h4>Events fired during a drag-and-drop action</h4>

  <p>The following events are involved in the drag-and-drop
  model. Whenever the processing model described below causes one of
  these events to be fired, the event fired must use the
  <code>DragEvent</code> interface defined above, must have the
  bubbling and cancelable behaviours given in the table below, and
  must have the context information set up as described after the
  table.</p>

  <h4>Drag-and-drop processing model</h4>

  <p>When the user attempts to begin a drag operation, the user agent
  must first determine what is being dragged. If the drag operation
  was invoked on a selection, then it is the selection that is being
  dragged. Otherwise, it is the first element, going up the ancestor
  chain, starting at the node that the user tried to drag, that has
  the DOM attribute <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> set
  to true. If there is no such element, then nothing is being dragged,
  the drag-and-drop operation is never started, and the user agent
  must not continue with this algorithm.</p>

  <p class="note"><code>img</code> elements and <code>a</code>
  elements with an <code title="attr-a-href">href</code> attribute
  have their <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> attribute
  set to true by default.</p>

  <p>If the user agent determines that something can be dragged, a
  <code title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event must then be
  fired.</p>

  <p>If it is a selection that is being dragged, then this event must
  be fired on the node that the user started the drag on (typically
  the text node that the user originally clicked). If the user did not
  specify a particular node, for example if the user just told the
  user agent to begin a drag of "the selection", then the event must
  be fired on the deepest node that is a common ancestor of all parts
  of the selection.</p>

  <p>If it is not a selection that is being dragged, then the event
  must be fired on the element that is being dragged.</p>

  <p>The node on which the event is fired is the <dfn>source
  node</dfn>. Multiple events are fired on this node during the course
  of the drag-and-drop operation.</p>

  <p>If it is a selection that is being dragged, the <code
  title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> member of the event
  must be created with no nodes. Otherwise, it must be created
  containing just the <span>source node</span>. Script can use the
  <code title="dom-DataTransfer-addElement">addElement()</code> method
  to add further elements to the list of what is being dragged.</p>

  <p>If it is a selection that is being dragged, the <code
  title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> member of the
  event must have the text of the selection added to it as the data
  associated with the <code title="">text/plain</code>
  format. Otherwise, if it is an <code>img</code> element being
  dragged, then the value of the element's <code
  title="dom-img-src">src</code> DOM attribute must be added,
  associated with the <code title="">text/uri-list</code>
  format. Otherwise, if it is an <code>a</code> element being dragged,
  then the value of the element's <code title="dom-a-href">href</code>
  DOM attribute must be added, associated with the <code
  title="">text/uri-list</code> format. Otherwise, no data is added to
  the object by the user agent.</p>

  <p>If the event is canceled, then the drag and drop operation must
  not occur; the user agent must not continue with this algorithm.</p>

  <p>If it is not canceled, then the drag and drop operation must be
  initiated.</p>

  <p class="note">Since events with no event handlers registered are,
  almost by definition, never canceled, drag and drop is always
  available to the user if the author does not specifically prevent
  it.</p>

  <p id="base-dnd-feedback">The drag-and-drop feedback must be
  generated from the first of the following sources that is
  available:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>The element specified in the last call to the <code
   title="dom-DataTransfer-setDragImage">setDragImage()</code> method
   of the <code title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code>
   object of the <code title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event,
   if the method was called. In visual media, if this is used, the
   <var title="">x</var> and <var title="">y</var> arguments that were
   passed to that method should be used as hints for where to put the
   cursor relative to the resulting image. The values are expressed as
   distances in CSS pixels from the left side and from the top side of
   the image respectively. <a href="#refsCSS21">[CSS21]</a></li> <!--
   CSS3 UNITS would be better -->

   <li>The elements that were added to the <code
   title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object, both
   before the event was fired, and during the handling of the event
   using the <code
   title="dom-DataTransfer-addElement">addElement()</code>
   method, if any such elements were indeed added.</li>

   <li>The selection that the user is dragging.</li>

  </ol><!-- XXX xref also link to the section that explains how to
  render drag-and-drop, :drag, :drop, etc. Safari has a pseudo-class
  that it uses to render an element off-screen to use as the drag
  feedback. -->

  <p>The user agent must take a note of <span
  title="dom-DataTransfer-setData">the data that was placed</span> in
  the <code title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code>
  object. This data will be made available again when the <code
  title="event-drop">drop</code> event is fired.</p>

  <p>From this point until the end of the drag-and-drop operation,
  device input events (e.g. mouse and keyboard events) must be
  suppressed. In addition, the user agent must track all DOM changes
  made during the drag-and-drop operation, and add them to its <a
  href="#undo">undo history</a> as one atomic operation once the
  drag-and-drop operation has ended.</p>

  <p>During the drag operation, the element directly indicated by the
  user as the drop target is called the <dfn>immediate user
  selection</dfn>. (Only elements can be selected by the user; other
  nodes must not be made available as drop targets.)

  However, the <span>immediate user selection</span> is not
  necessarily the <dfn>current target element</dfn>, which is the
  element currently selected for the drop part of the drag-and-drop
  operation.

  The <span>immediate user selection</span> changes as the user
  selects different elements (either by pointing at them with a
  pointing device, or by selecting them in some other way). The
  <span>current target element</span> changes when the <span>immediate
  user selection</span> changes, based on the results of event
  handlers in the document, as described below.</p>

  <p>Both the <span>current target element</span> and the
  <span>immediate user selection</span> can be null, which means no
  target element is selected. They can also both be elements in other
  (DOM-based) documents, or other (non-Web) programs altogether. (For
  example, a user could drag text to a word-processor.) The
  <span>current target element</span> is initially null.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is also a <dfn>current drag operation</dfn>,
  which can take on the values "none", "copy", "link", and "move".
  Initially it has the value "none". It is updated by the user agent
  as described in the steps below.</p>

  <p>User agents must, every 350ms (&#xB1;200ms), perform the
  following steps in sequence. (If the user agent is still performing
  the previous iteration of the sequence when the next iteration
  becomes due, the user agent must not execute the overdue iteration,
  effectively "skipping missed frames" of the drag and drop
  operation.)</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>First, the user agent must fire a <code
    title="event-drag">drag</code> event at the <span>source
    node</span>. If this event is canceled, the user agent must set
    the <span>current drag operation</span> to none (no drag
    operation).</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Next, if the <code title="event-drag">drag</code> event was not
    canceled and the user has not ended the drag-and-drop operation,
    the user agent must check the state of the drag-and-drop
    operation, as follows:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>

      <p>First, if the user is indicating a different <span>immediate
      user selection</span> than during the last iteration (or if this
      is the first iteration), and if this <span>immediate user
      selection</span> is not the same as the <span>current target
      element</span>, then the <span>current target element</span> must
      be updated, as follows:</p>

      <ol>

       <li>

        <p>If the new <span>immediate user selection</span> is null, or
        is in a non-DOM document or application, then set the
        <span>current target element</span> to the same value.</p>

       <li>

        <p>Otherwise, the user agent must fire a <code
        title="event-dragenter">dragenter</code> event at the
        <span>immediate user selection</span>.</p>

       </li>

       <li>

        <p>If the event is canceled, then the <span>current target
        element</span> must be set to the <span>immediate user
        selection</span>.</p>

       </li>

       <li>

        <p>Otherwise, if the <span>current target element</span> is
        not <span>the body element</span>, the user agent must fire a
        <code title="event-dragenter">dragenter</code> event at
        <span>the body element</span>, and the <span>current target
        element</span> must be set to <span>the body element</span>,
        regardless of whether that event was canceled or not. (If
        <span>the body element</span> is null, then the <span>current
        target element</span> would be set to null too in this case,
        it wouldn't be set to the <code>Document</code> object.)</p>

       </li>

      </ol>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>If the previous step caused the <span>current target
      element</span> to change, and if the previous target element was
      not null or a part of a non-DOM document, the user agent must fire
      a <code title="event-dragleave">dragleave</code> event at the
      previous target element.</p>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>If the <span>current target element</span> is a DOM element,
      the user agent must fire a <code
      title="event-dragover">dragover</code> event at this <span>current
      target element</span>.</p>

      <p>If the <code title="event-dragover">dragover</code> event is
      canceled, the <span>current drag operation</span> must be reset
      to "none".</p>

      <p>Otherwise, the <span>current drag operation</span> must be
      set based on the values the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed">effectAllowed</code> and
      <code title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code>
      attributes of the <code
      title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object
      had after the event was handled, as per the following table:</p>

      <table>
       <thead>
        <tr>
         <th><code title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed">effectAllowed</code></th>
         <th><code title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code></th>
         <th>Drag operation</th>
        </tr>
       </thead>
       <tr>
        <td><code title="">uninitialized</code>, <code title="">copy</code>, <code title="">copyLink</code>, <code title="">copyMove</code>, or <code title="">all</code></td>
        <td><code title="">copy</code></td>
        <td>"copy"</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td><code title="">uninitialized</code>, <code title="">link</code>, <code title="">copyLink</code>, <code title="">linkMove</code>, or <code title="">all</code></td>
        <td><code title="">link</code></td>

       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td><code title="">uninitialized</code>, <code title="">move</code>, <code title="">copyMove</code>, <code title="">linkMove</code>, or <code title="">all</code></td>

       <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Any other case</td>
        <td>"none"</td>
       </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Then, regardless of whether the <code
      title="event-dragover">dragover</code> event was canceled or
      not, the drag feedback (e.g. the mouse cursor) must be updated
      to match the <span>current drag operation</span>, as
      follows:</p>

      <table>
       <thead>
        <tr>
         <th>Drag operation</th>
         <th>Feedback</th>
        </tr>
       </thead>
       <tr>
        <td>"copy"</td>
        <td>Data will be copied if dropped here.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>"link"</td>
        <td>Data will be linked if dropped here.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>"move"</td>
        <td>Data will be moved if dropped here.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>"none"</td>
        <td>No operation allowed, dropping here will cancel the drag and drop operation.</td>
       </tr>
      </table>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>Otherwise, if the <span>current target element</span> is not a
      DOM element, the user agent must use platform-specific mechanisms
      to determine what drag operation is being performed (none, copy,
      link, or move). This sets the <em>current drag operation</em>.</p>

     </li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, if the user ended the drag and drop operation (e.g.
    by releasing the mouse button in a mouse-driven drag-and-drop
    interface), or if the <code title="event-drag">drag</code> event
    was cancelled, then this will be the last iteration. The user
    agent must follow the following steps, then stop looping.</p>

    <ol>

     <li>

      <p>If the <span>current drag operation</span> is none (no drag
      operation), or, if the user ended the drag-and-drop operation by
      canceling it (e.g. by hitting the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key), or if
      the <span>current target element</span> is null, then the drag
      operation failed. If the <span>current target element</span> is
      a DOM element, the user agent must fire a <code
      title="event-dragleave">dragleave</code> event at it; otherwise,
      if it is not null, it must use platform-specific conventions for
      drag cancellation.</p>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>Otherwise, the drag operation was as success. If the
      <span>current target element</span> is a DOM element, the user
      agent must fire a <code title="event-drop">drop</code> event at
      it; otherwise, it must use platform-specific conventions for
      indicating a drop.</p>

      <p>When the target is a DOM element, the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code> attribute
      of the event's <code
      title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object
      must be given the value representing the <span>current drag
      operation</span> (<code title="">copy</code>, <code
      title="">link</code>, or <code title="">move</code>), and the
      object must be set up so that the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-getData">getData()</code> method will
      return the data that was added during the <code
      title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event.</p>

      <p>If the event is canceled, the <span>current drag
      operation</span> must be set to the value of the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code> attribute
      of the event's <code
      title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object as
      it stood after the event was handled.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, the event is not canceled, and the user agent must
      perform the event's default action, which depends on the exact
      target as follows:</p>

      <dl class="switch">

       <dt>If the <span>current target element</span> is a text field
       (e.g. <code>textarea</code>, or an <code>input</code> element
       with <code title="">type="text"</code><!--XXX xref-->)</dt>

       <dd>The user agent must insert the data associated with the
       <code>text/plain</code> format, if any, into the text field in
       a manner consistent with platform-specific conventions
       (e.g. inserting it at the current mouse cursor position, or
       inserting it at the end of the field).</dd>

       <dt>Otherwise</dt>

       <dd>Reset the <span>current drag operation</span> to
       "none".</dd>

      </dl>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>Finally, the user agent must fire a <code
      title="event-dragend">dragend</code> event at the <span>source
      node</span>, with the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code> attribute
      of the event's <code
      title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object
      being set to the value corresponding to the <span>current drag
      operation</span>.</p>

      <p class="note">The <span>current drag operation</span> can
      change during the processing of the <code
      title="event-drop">drop</code> event, if one was fired.</p>

      <p>The event is not cancelable. After the event has been
      handled, the user agent must act as follows:</p>

      <dl class="switch">

       <dt>If the <span>current target element</span> is a text field
       (e.g. <code>textarea</code>, or an <code>input</code> element
       with <code title="">type="text"</code><!--XXX xref-->), and a
       <code title="event-drop">drop</code> event was fired in the
       previous step, and the <span>current drag operation</span> is
       "move", and the source of the drag and drop operation is a
       selection in the DOM</dt>

       <dd>The user agent should delete the range representing the
       dragged selection from the DOM.</dd>

       <dt>If the <span>current target element</span> is a text field
       (e.g. <code>textarea</code>, or an <code>input</code> element
       with <code title="">type="text"</code><!--XXX xref-->), and a
       <code title="event-drop">drop</code> event was fired in the
       previous step, and the <span>current drag operation</span> is
       "move", and the source of the drag and drop operation is a
       selection in a text field</dt>

       <dd>The user agent should delete the dragged selection from the
       relevant text field.</dd>

       <dt>Otherwise</dt>

       <dd>The event has no default action.</dd>

      </dl>

     </li>

    </ol>

   </li>

  </ol>


  <h5>When the drag-and-drop operation starts or ends in another
  document</h5>

  <p>The model described above is independent of which
  <code>Document</code> object the nodes involved are from; the events
  must be fired as described above and the rest of the processing
  model must be followed as described above, irrespective of how many
  documents are involved in the operation.</p>


  <h5>When the drag-and-drop operation starts or ends in another
  application</h5>

  <p>If the drag is initiated in another application, the <span>source
  node</span> is not a DOM node, and the user agent must use
  platform-specific conventions instead when the requirements above
  involve the source node. User agents in this situation must act as
  if the dragged data had been added to the <code>DataTransfer</code>
  object when the drag started, even though no <code
  title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event was actually fired;
  user agents must similarly use platform-specific conventions when
  deciding on what drag feedback to use.</p>

  <p>If a drag is started in a document but ends in another
  application, then the user agent must instead replace the parts of
  the processing model relating to handling the <em>target</em>
  according to platform-specific conventions.</p>

  <p>In any case, scripts running in the context of the document must
  not be able to distinguish the case of a drag-and-drop operation
  being started or ended in another application from the case of a
  drag-and-drop operation being started or ended in another document
  from another domain.</p>



  <h4>The <dfn title="attr-draggable"><code>draggable</code></dfn> attribute</h4>

  <p>All elements may have the <code
  title="attr-draggable">draggable</code> content attribute set. If
  the attribute is set, it must be set either to the empty string, to
  the value <code title="">true</code>, or to the value <code
  title="">false</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-draggable"><code>draggable</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, whose value depends on the content attribute's in the way
  described below, controls whether or not the element is
  draggable. Generally, only text selections are draggable, but
  elements whose <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM
  attribute is true become draggable as well.</p>

  <p>If an element has the <code
  title="attr-draggable">draggable</code> content attribute set to the
  empty string or to the literal value <code title="">true</code>, the
  <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute must
  return true.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if an element has the <code
  title="attr-draggable">draggable</code> content attribute set to the
  literal value <code title="">false</code>, the <code
  title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute must return
  false.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the element is an <code>img</code> element, or, if
  the element is an <code>a</code> element with an <code
  title="attr-a-href">href</code> content attribute, the <code
  title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute must return
  true.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM
  must return false.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute
  is set to the value false, the <code
  title="attr-draggable">draggable</code> content attribute must be
  set to the literal value <code title="">false</code>. If the <code
  title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute is set to the
  value true, the <code title="attr-draggable">draggable</code>
  content attribute must be set to the literal value <code
  title="">true</code>.</p>



  <h4>Security risks in the drag-and-drop model</h4>

  <p>User agents must not make the data added to the
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object during the <code
  title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event available to scripts
  until the <code title="event-drop">drop</code> event, because
  otherwise, if a user were to drag sensitive information from one
  document to a second document, crossing a hostile third document in
  the process, the hostile document could intercept the data.</p>

  <p>For the same reason, user agents must only consider a drop to be
  successful if the user specifically ended the drag operation &mdash;
  if any scripts end the drag operation, it must be considered
  unsuccessful (canceled) and the <code title="event-drop">drop</code>
  event must not be fired.</p>

  <p>User agents should take care to not start drag and drop
  operations in response to script actions. For example, in a
  mouse-and-window environment, if a script moves a window while the
  user has his mouse button depressed, the UA would not consider that
  to start a drag. This is important because otherwise UAs could cause
  data to be dragged from sensitive sources and dropped into hostile
  documents without the user's consent.</p>





  <h3 id="undo"><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> <dfn>Undo history</dfn></h3>

  <p class="big-issue">There has got to be a better way of doing this, surely.</p>

  <p>The user agent must associate an <dfn>undo transaction
  history</dfn> with each <code>HTMLDocument</code> object.</p>

  <p>The <span>undo transaction history</span> is a list of
  entries. The entries are of two type: <span>DOM changes</span> and
  <span title="undo object">undo objects</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <dfn>DOM changes</dfn> entry in the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> consists of batches of one or more of the
  following:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Changes to the <span>content attributes</span> of an
   <code>Element</code> node.</li>

   <li>Changes to the <span>DOM attributes</span> of a
   <code>Node</code>.</li> <!-- XXX uh, these change on their own, so
   clearly this isn't going to fly. Which DOM attributes, exactly? -->

   <li>Changes to the DOM hierarchy of nodes that are descendants of
   the <code>HTMLDocument</code> object (<code>parentNode</code>,
   <code>childNodes</code>).</li>

  </ul>

  <p><dfn>Undo object</dfn> entries consist of objects representing
  state that scripts running in the document are managing. For
  example, a Web mail application could use an <span>undo
  object</span> to keep track of the fact that a user has moved an
  e-mail to a particular folder, so that the user can undo the
  action and have the e-mail return to its former location.</p>

  <p>Broadly speaking, <span>DOM changes</span> entries are handled by
  the UA in response to user edits of form controls and <span>editing
  hosts</span> on the page, and <span>undo object</span> entries are
  handled by script in response to higher-level user actions (such as
  interactions with server-side state, or in the implementation of a
  drawing tool).</p>


  <h4>The <code>UndoManager</code> interface</h4>

  <div class="big-issue">

   <p>This API sucks. Seriously. It's a terrible API. Really bad. I
   hate it. Here are the requirements:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>Has to cope with cases where the server has undo state already
    when the page is loaded, that can be stuffed into the undo buffer
    onload.</li>

    <li>Has to support undo/redo.</li>

    <li>Has to cope with the "undo" action being "contact the server
    and tell it to undo", rather than it being the opposite of the
    "redo" action.</li>

    <li>Has to cope with some undo states expiring from the undo
    history (e.g. server can only remember one undelete action) but
    other states not expiring (e.g. client can undo arbitrary amounts
    of local edits).</li>

   </ul>

  </div>

  <p>To manage <span>undo object</span> entries in the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>, the <code>UndoManager</code>
  interface can be used:</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>UndoManager</dfn> {
  unsigned long <span title="dom-UndoManager-add">add</span>(in DOMObject data, in DOMStrong title);
  void <span title="dom-UndoManager-remove">remove</span>(in unsigned long index);
  void <span title="dom-UndoManager-clearUndo">clearUndo</span>();
  void <span title="dom-UndoManager-clearRedo">clearRedo</span>();
  DOMObject <span title="dom-UndoManager-item">item</span>(in unsigned long index);
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-UndoManager-length">length</span>;
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-UndoManager-position">position</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <code title="dom-undoManager">undoManager</code> attribute of
  the <code>Window</code> interface must return the object
  implementing the <code>UndoManager</code> interface for that
  <code>Window</code> object's associated <code>HTMLDocument</code>
  object.</p>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, objects implementing this interface
  must also support being dereferenced using the square bracket
  notation, such that dereferencing with an integer index is
  equivalent to invoking the <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-item">item()</code> method with that index
  (e.g. <code title="">undoManager[1]</code> returns the same as <code
  title="">undoManager.item(1)</code>).</p>

  <p><code>UndoManager</code> objects represent their document's
  <span>undo transaction history</span>. Only <span>undo object</span>
  entries are visible with this API, but this does not mean that
  <span>DOM changes</span> entries are absent from the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManager-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of <span>undo object</span> entries
  in the <span>undo transaction history</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManager-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">n</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">n</var>th <span>undo object</span> entry in the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span>undo transaction history</span> has a <dfn title="undo
  position">current position</dfn>. This is the position between two
  entries in the <span>undo transaction history</span>'s list where
  the previous entry represents what needs to happen if the user
  invokes the "undo" command (the "undo" side, lower numbers), and the
  next entry represents what needs to happen if the user invokes the
  "redo" command (the "redo" side, higher numbers).</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-UndoManager-position"><code>position</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the index of the <span>undo object</span>
  entry nearest to the <span>undo position</span>, on the "redo"
  side. If there are no <span>undo object</span> entries on the "redo"
  side, then the attribute must return the same as the <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-length">length</code> attribute. If there are
  no <span>undo object</span> entries on the "undo" side of the
  <span>undo position</span>, the <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-position">position</code> attribute returns
  zero.</p>

  <p class="note">Since the <span>undo transaction history</span>
  contains both <span>undo object</span> entries and <span>DOM
  changes</span> entries, but the <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-position">position</code> attribute only
  returns indices relative to <span>undo object</span> entries, it is
  possible for several "undo" or "redo" actions to be performed
  without the value of the <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-position">position</code> attribute
  changing.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManager-add"><code>add(<var title="">data</var>,
  <var title="">title</var>)</code></dfn> method's behaviour depends on the
  current state. Normally, it must insert the <var title="">data</var> object
  passed as an argument into the <span>undo transaction history</span>
  immediately before the <span>undo position</span>, optionally
  remembering the given <var title="">title</var> to use in the UI. If the
  method is called <span title="do-undo">during an undo
  operation</span>, however, the object must instead be added
  immediately <em>after</em> the <span>undo position</span>.</p>

  <p>If the method is called and there is neither <span
  title="do-undo">an undo operation in progress</span> nor <span
  title="do-redo">a redo operation in progress</span> then any entries
  in the <span>undo transaction history</span> after the <span>undo
  position</span> must be removed (as if <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-clearRedo">clearRedo()</code> had been
  called).</p>

  <p class="big-issue">We could fire events when someone adds
  something to the undo history -- one event per undo object entry
  before the position (or after, during redo addition), allowing the
  script to decide if that entry should remain or not. Or
  something. Would make it potentially easier to expire server-held
  state when the server limitations come into play.</p>

  <!-- XXX note on expiring undo in case server can only do one level undo -->

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManager-remove"><code>remove(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must remove the <span>undo
  object</span> entry with the specified <var title="">index</var>. If
  the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-length">length</code> then the method must
  raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception. <span>DOM
  changes</span> entries are unaffected by this method.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-UndoManager-clearUndo"><code>clearUndo()</code></dfn>
  method must remove all entries in the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> before the <span>undo position</span>, be they
  <span>DOM changes</span> entries or <span>undo object</span>
  entries.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-UndoManager-clearRedo"><code>clearRedo()</code></dfn>
  method must remove all entries in the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> after the <span>undo position</span>, be they
  <span>DOM changes</span> entries or <span>undo object</span>
  entries.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">Another idea is to have a way for scripts to
  say "startBatchingDOMChangesForUndo()" and after that the changes to
  the DOM go in as if the user had done them.</p>


  <h4><dfn title="do-undo">Undo: moving back in the undo transaction history</dfn></h4>

  <p>When the user invokes an undo operation, or when the <code
  title="dom-document-execCommand">execCommand()</code> method is
  called with the <code title="command-undo">undo</code> command, the
  user agent must perform an undo operation.</p>

  <p>If the <span>undo position</span> is at the start of the
  <span>undo transaction history</span>, then the user agent must do
  nothing.</p>

  <p>If the entry immediately before the <span>undo position</span> is
  a <span>DOM changes</span> entry, then the user agent must remove
  that <span>DOM changes</span> entry, reverse the DOM changes that
  were listed in that entry, and, if the changes were reversed with no
  problems, add a new <span>DOM changes</span> entry (consisting of
  the opposite of those DOM changes) to the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> on the other side of the <span>undo
  position</span>.</p>

  <p>If the DOM changes cannot be undone (e.g. because the DOM state
  is no longer consistent with the changes represented in the entry),
  then the user agent must simply remove the <span>DOM changes</span>
  entry, without doing anything else.</p>

  <p>If the entry immediately before the <span>undo position</span> is
  an <span>undo object</span> entry, then the user agent must first
  remove that <span>undo object</span> entry from the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>, and then must fire an <code
  title="event-undo">undo</code> event on the <code>Document</code>
  object, using the <span>undo object</span> entry's associated undo
  object as the event's data.</p>

  <p>Any calls to <code title="dom-undoManager-add">add()</code> while
  the event is being handled will be used to populate the redo
  history, and will then be used if the user invokes the "redo"
  command to undo his undo.</p>


  <h4><dfn title="do-redo">Redo: moving forward in the undo transaction history</dfn></h4>

  <p>When the user invokes a redo operation, or when the <code
  title="dom-document-execCommand">execCommand()</code> method is
  called with the <code title="command-redo">redo</code> command, the
  user agent must perform a redo operation.</p>

  <p>This is mostly the opposite of an <span title="do-undo">undo
  operation</span>, but the full definition is included here for
  completeness.</p>

  <p>If the <span>undo position</span> is at the end of the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>, then the user agent must do nothing.</p>

  <p>If the entry immediately after the <span>undo position</span> is
  a <span>DOM changes</span> entry, then the user agent must remove
  that <span>DOM changes</span> entry, reverse the DOM changes that
  were listed in that entry, and, if the changes were reversed with no
  problems, add a new <span>DOM changes</span> entry (consisting of
  the opposite of those DOM changes) to the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> on the other side of the <span>undo
  position</span>.</p>

  <p>If the DOM changes cannot be redone (e.g. because the DOM state
  is no longer consistent with the changes represented in the entry),
  then the user agent must simply remove the <span>DOM changes</span>
  entry, without doing anything else.</p>

  <p>If the entry immediately after the <span>undo position</span> is
  an <span>undo object</span> entry, then the user agent must first
  remove that <span>undo object</span> entry from the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>, and then must fire a <code
  title="event-undo">redo</code> event on the <code>Document</code>
  object, using the <span>undo object</span> entry's associated undo
  object as the event's data.</p>

  <h4>The <code>UndoManagerEvent</code> interface and the <code title="event-undo">undo</code> and <code title="event-redo">redo</code> events</h4>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>UndoManagerEvent</dfn> : Event {
  readonly attribute DOMObject <span title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-data">data</span>;
  void <span title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-initUndoManagerEvent">initUndoManagerEvent</span>(in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMObject dataArg);
  void <span title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-initUndoManagerEventNS">initUndoManagerEventNS</span>(in DOMString namespaceURIArg, in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMObject dataArg);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-initUndoManagerEvent"><code>initUndoManagerEvent()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn><code
  title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-initUndoManagerEventNS">initUndoManagerEventNS()</code></dfn>
  methods must initialise the event in a manner analogous to the
  similarly-named methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a
  href="#DOM3Events">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-data"><code>data</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the <span>undo object</span> for the event.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-undo"><code>undo</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="event-redo"><code>redo</code></dfn> events do not bubble,
  cannot be canceled, and have no default action. When the user agent
  fires one of these events it must use the
  <code>UndoManagerEvent</code> interface, with the <code
  title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-data">data</code> field containing the
  relevant <span>undo object</span>.</p>


  <h4>Implementation notes</h4>

  <p>How user agents present the above conceptual model to the user is
  not defined. The undo interface could be a filtered view of the
  <span>undo transaction history</span>, it could manipulate the
  <span>undo transaction history</span> in ways not described above,
  and so forth. For example, it is possible to design a UA that
  appears to have separate <span title="undo transaction history">undo
  transaction histories</span> for each form control; similarly, it is
  possible to design systems where the user has access to more undo
  information than is present in the offical (as described above)
  <span>undo transaction history</span> (such as providing a
  tree-based approach to document state). Such UI models should be
  based upon the single <span>undo transaction history</span>
  described in this section, however, such that to a script there is
  no detectable difference.</p>


  <h3><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Command APIs</h3>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-execCommand"><code>execCommand(<var
  title="">commandID</var>, <var title="">doShowUI</var>, <var
  title="">value</var>)</code></dfn> method on the
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface allows scripts to perform
  actions on the <span title="the selection">current selection</span>
  or at the current caret position. Generally, these commands would be
  used to implement editor UI, for example having a "delete" button on
  a toolbar.</p>

  <p>There are three variants to this method, with one, two, and three
  arguments respectively.  The <var title="">doShowUI</var> and <var
  title="">value</var> parameters, even if specified, are ignored
  unless otherwise stated.</p>

  <p class="note">In this specification, in fact, the <var
  title="">doShowUI</var> parameter is always ignored, regardless of
  its value. It is included for historical reasons only.</p>

  <p>When any of these methods are invoked, user agents must act as
  described in the list below.</p>

  <p>For actions marked "<dfn>editing hosts only</dfn>", if the
  selection is not entirely within an <span>editing host</span>, of if
  there is no selection and the caret is not inside an <span>editing

  <h3 id="selection"><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> The text selection APIs</h3>

  <p>Every <span>browsing context</span> has <dfn title="the
  selection">a selection</dfn>. The selection may be empty, and the
  selection may have more than one range (a disjointed selection). The
  user should be able to change the selection. User agents are not
  required to let the user select more than one range, and may
  collapse multiple ranges in the selection to a single range when the
  user interacts with the selection. (But, of course, the user agent
  may let the user create selections with multiple ranges.)</p>

  <p>This one selection must be shared by all the content of the
  browsing context (though not by nested browsing contexts), including
  any editing hosts in the document. (Editing hosts that are not
  inside a document cannot have a selection.)</p>

  <p>If the selection is empty (collapsed, so that it has only one
  segment and that segment's start and end points are the same) then
  the selection's position should equal the caret position. When the
  selection is not empty, this specification does not define the caret
  position; user agents should follow platform conventions in deciding
  whether the caret is at the start of the selection, the end of the
  selection, or somewhere else.</p>

  <p>On some platforms (such as those using Wordstar editing
  conventions), the caret position is totally independent of the start
  and end of the selection, even when the selection is empty. On such
  platforms, user agents may ignore the requirement that the cursor
  position be linked to the position of the selection altogether.</p>

  <p>Mostly for historical reasons, in addition to the <span>browsing
  context</span>'s <span title="the selection">selection</span>, each
  <code>textarea</code> and <code>input</code> element has an
  independent selection. These are the <dfn title="text field
  selection">text field selections</dfn>.</p>

  <p>The <code>datagrid</code> and <code>select</code> elements also
  have selections, indicating which items have been picked by the
  user. These are not discussed in this section.</p>

  <p class="note">This specification does not specify how selections
  are presented to the user. The Selectors specification, in
  conjunction with CSS, can be used to style text selections using the
  <code>::selection</code> pseudo-element. <a

  This spec doesn't have everything from there yet, in particular
  selectionLanguageChange() and containsNode() are missing. They are missing
  because I couldn't work out how to define them in terms of Ranges.

  I also haven't included extend():

    void <span title="dom-selection-extend">extend</span>(in Node parentNode, in long offset);
    // raise if no range
    // raise WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR if parentNode not in document
    // do something

  ...mostly because I can't work out how to describe what it does quickly.

  <p>The <code>Selection</code> interface is represents a list of
  <code>Range</code> objects. The first item in the list has index 0,
  and the last item has index <var title="">count</var>-1, where
  <var title="">count</var> is the number of ranges in the list. <a
  href="#refsDOM2RANGE">[DOM2RANGE]</a></p>

  <p>All of the members of the <code>Selection</code> interface are
  defined in terms of operations on the <code>Range</code> objects
  represented by this object. These operations can raise exceptions,
  as defined for the <code>Range</code> interface; this can therefore
  result in the members of the <code>Selection</code> interface
  raising exceptions as well, in addition to any explicitly called out
  below.</p> <!--- XXX example -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-anchorNode"><code>anchorNode</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the value returned by the <code
  title="">startContainer</code> attribute of the last
  <code>Range</code> object in the list, or null if the list is
  empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-anchorOffset"><code>anchorOffset</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the value returned by the <code
  title="">startOffset</code> attribute of the last <code>Range</code>
  object in the list, or 0 if the list is empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-focusNode"><code>focusNode</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the value returned by the <code
  title="">endContainer</code> attribute of the last
  <code>Range</code> object in the list, or null if the list is
  empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-focusOffset"><code>focusOffset</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the value returned by the <code
  title="">endOffset</code> attribute of the last <code>Range</code>
  object in the list, or 0 if the list is empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-isCollapsed"><code>isCollapsed</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if there are zero ranges, or if there is
  exactly one range and its <code title="">collapsed</code> attribute
  is itself true. Otherwise it must return false.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-collapse"><code>collapse(<var title="">parentNode</var>,
  <var title="">offset</var>)</code></dfn> method must raise a
  <code>WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR</code> DOM exception if
  <var title="">parentNode</var>'s <code title="">ownerDocument</code> is not
  the <code>HTMLDocument</code> object with which the
  <code>Selection</code> object is associated. Otherwise it is, and
  the method must remove all the ranges in the <code>Selection</code>
  list, then create a new <code>Range</code> object, add it to the
  list, and invoke its <code title="">setStart()</code> and <code
  title="">setEnd()</code> methods with the <var title="">parentNode</var> and
  <var title="">offset</var> values as their arguments.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-collapseToStart"><code>collapseToStart()</code></dfn>
  method must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> DOM exception if
  there are no ranges in the list. Otherwise, it must invoke the <code
  title="dom-selection-collapse">collapse()</code> method with the
  <code title="">startContainer</code> and <code
  title="">startOffset</code> values of the first <code>Range</code>
  object in the list as the arguments.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-collapseToEnd"><code>collapseToEnd()</code></dfn>
  method must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> DOM exception if
  there are no ranges in the list. Otherwise, it must invoke the <code
  title="dom-selection-collapse">collapse()</code> method with the
  <code title="">endContainer</code> and <code
  title="">endOffset</code> values of the last <code>Range</code>
  object in the list as the arguments.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-selectAllChildren"><code>selectAllChildren(<var title="">parentNode</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must invoke the <code
  title="dom-selection-collapse">collapse()</code> method with the
  <var title="">parentNode</var> value as the first argument and 0 as the
  second argument, and must then invoke the <code
  title="">selectNodeContents()</code> method on the first (and only)
  range in the list with the <var title="">parentNode</var> value as the
  argument.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-deleteFromDocument"><code>deleteFromDocument()</code></dfn>
  method must invoke the <code title="">deleteContents()</code> method
  on each range in the list, if any, from first to last.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-rangeCount"><code>rangeCount</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of ranges in the list.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-getRangeAt"><code>getRangeAt(<var title="">index</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must return the <var title="">index</var>th range in the list. If
  <var title="">index</var> is less than zero or greater or equal to the value
  returned by the <code
  title="dom-selection-rangeCount">rangeCount</code> attribute, then
  the method must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> DOM
  exception.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-addRange"><code>addRange(<var title="">range</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must add the given <var title="">range</var> Range object to the list
  of selections, at the end (so the newly added range is the new last
  range). Duplicates are not prevented; a range may be added more than
  once in which case it appears in the list more than once, which (for
  example) will cause <code
  title="dom-selection-toString">toString()</code> to return the
  range's text twice.</p> <!-- XXX how does this interact with
  deleteFromDocument() which acts on all ranges? -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-removeRange"><code>removeRange(<var title="">range</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must remove the first occurrence of <var title="">range</var> in the
  list of ranges, if it appears at all.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-removeAllRanges"><code>removeAllRanges()</code></dfn>
  method must remove all the ranges from the list of ranges, such that
  the <code title="dom-selection-rangeCount">rangeCount</code>
  attribute returns 0 after the <code
  title="dom-selection-removeAllRanges">removeAllRanges()</code>
  method is invoked (and until a new range is added to the list,
  either through this interface or via user interaction).</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-toString"><code>toString()</code></dfn> method
  must return a concatenation of the results of invoking the <code
  title="">toString()</code> method of the <code>Range</code> object
  on each of the ranges of the selection, in the order they appear in
  the list (first to last).</p>

  <p>In language bindings where this is supported, objects
  implementing the <code>Selection</code> interface must stringify to
  the value returned by the object's <code
  title="dom-selection-toString">toString()</code> method.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>In the following document fragment, the emphasised parts
   indicate the selection.</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>The cute girl likes <em>the </em>&lt;cite><em>Oxford English</em> Dictionary&lt;/cite>.&lt/p></pre>
   <p>If a script invoked <code
   title="">window.getSelection().toString()</code>, the return value
   would be "<code>the Oxford English</code>".</p>
  </div>

  <p class="note">The <code>Selection</code> interface has no relation
  to the <code>DataGridSelection</code> interface.</p>


  <h4 id="textFieldSelection">APIs for the text field selections</h4>

  <p class="big-issue"When we define HTMLTextAreaElement and
  HTMLInputElement we will have to add the IDL given below to both of
  their IDLs.</p>

  <p>The <code>input</code> and <code>textarea</code> elements define
  four members in their DOM interfaces for handling their text
  selection:</p>

  <pre>  void <span title="dom-textarea/input-select">select</span>();
           attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-textarea/input-selectionStart">selectionStart</span>;
           attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-textarea/input-selectionEnd">selectionEnd</span>;
  void <span title="dom-textarea/input-setSelectionRange">setSelectionRange</span>(in unsigned long start, in unsigned long end);</pre>

  <p>These methods and attributes expose and control the selection of
  <code>input</code> and <code>textarea</code> text fields.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea/input-select"><code>select()</code></dfn> method
  must cause the contents of the text field to be fully selected.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea/input-selectionStart"><code>selectionStart</code></dfn>
  attribute must, on getting, return the offset (in logical order) to
  the character that immediately follows the start of the
  selection. If there is no selection, then it must return the offset
  (in logical order) to the character that immediately follows the
  text entry cursor.</p>

  <p>On setting, it must act as if the <code
  title="dom-textarea/input-setSelectionRange">setSelectionRange()</code>
  method had been called, with the new value as the first argument,
  and the current value of the <code
  title="dom-textarea/input-selectionEnd">selectionEnd</code>
  attribute as the second argument, unless the current value of the
  <code title="dom-textarea/input-selectionEnd">selectionEnd</code> is
  less than the new value, in which case the second argument must also
  be the new value.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea/input-selectionEnd"><code>selectionEnd</code></dfn>
  attribute must, on getting, return the offset (in logical order) to
  the character that immediately follows the end of the selection. If
  there is no selection, then it must return the offset (in logical
  order) to the character that immediately follows the text entry
  cursor.</p>

  <p>On setting, it must act as if the <code
  title="dom-textarea/input-setSelectionRange">setSelectionRange()</code>
  method had been called, with the current value of the <code
  title="dom-textarea/input-selectionStart">selectionStart</code>
  attribute as the first argument, and new value as the second
  argument.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea/input-setSelectionRange"><code>setSelectionRange(<var
  title="">start</var>, <var title="">end</var>)</code></dfn> method
  must set the selection of the text field to the sequence of
  characters starting with the character at the <var
  title="">start</var>th position (in logical order) and ending with
  the character at the <span>(<var title="">end</var>-1)</span>th
  position. Arguments greater than the length of the value in the text
  field must be treated as pointing at the end of the text field. If
  <var title="">end</var> is less than or equal to <var
  title="">start</var> then the start of the selection and the end of
  the selection must both be placed immediately before the character
  with offset <var title="">end</var>. In UAs where there is no
  concept of an empty selection, this must set the cursor to be just
  before the character with offset <var title="">end</var>.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>To obtain the currently selected text, the following JavaScript
   suffices:</p>

   <pre>var selectionText = control.value.substring(control.selectionStart, control.selectionEnd);</pre>

   <p>...where <var title="">control</var> is the <code>input</code>
   or <code>textarea</code> element.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Characters with no visible rendering, such as U+200D ZERO WIDTH
  JOINER, still count as characters. Thus, for instance, the selection
  can include just an invisible character, and the text insertion
  cursor can be placed to one side or another of such a character.</p>

  <p>When these methods and attributes are used with
  <code>input</code> elements that are not displaying simple text
  fields, they must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p class="big-issue"> should we move all the img, object, embed,
  iframe, etc, elements here? Or move canvas up to the semantics
  section? Or define the elements up there but have the APIs here?
  <!-- XXX Don't forget to update the intro/structure section if you
  change this around. --></p>

  <h3><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Dynamic graphics: The bitmap canvas</h3>

  <p class="big-issue">This needs to be reviewed for normative
  criteria. As it stands there is terrible abuse of the word "should",
  for example.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>canvas</code></dfn> element represents a
  resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering
  graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly.</p>

  <p>When authors use the <code>canvas</code> element, they should
  also provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys
  essentially the same function or purpose as the bitmap canvas. This
  content may be placed as content of the <code>canvas</code>
  element.</p>

  <p>Authors should not use the <code>canvas</code> element in a
  document when a more suitable element is available. For example, it
  is inappropriate to use a <code>canvas</code> element to render a
  page heading: if the desired presentation of the heading is
  graphically intense, it should be marked up using appropriate
  elements (typically <code>h1</code>) and then styled using CSS and
  supporting technologies such as XBL.</p>

  <p>In non-visual media, and in visual media with scripting disabled,
  the <code>canvas</code> element should be treated as an ordinary
  block-level element and the fallback content should therefore be
  used instead.</p>

  <p>In non-interactive, static, visual media, if the
  <code>canvas</code> element has been previously painted on (e.g. if
  the page was viewed in an interactive visual media and is now being
  printed, or if some script that ran during the page layout process
  painted on the element), then the <code>canvas</code> element should
  be treated as a replaced inline-level element with the current image
  and size. Otherwise, the element should be treated as an ordinary
  inline-level element and the fallback content should therefore be
  used instead.</p>

  <p>In interactive visual media with scripting enabled, the canvas
  element is an inline-level replaced element.</p>

  <p>The <code>canvas</code> element has two attributes to control the
  size of the coordinate space: <code>height</code> and
  <code>width</code>. These attributes each take a positive integer
  value (one digit in the range 1-9 followed by zero or more digits in
  the range 0-9, interpreted in base ten). If an attribute is missing,
  or if it has a value that does not match this syntax, then its
  default value must be used instead. The <code>width</code> attribute
  defaults to 300, and the <code>height</code> attribute defaults to
  150.</p>

  <p>The intrinsic dimensions of the <code>canvas</code> element equal
  the size of the coordinate space, with the numbers interpreted in
  CSS pixels. However, the element can be sized arbitrarily by a
  style sheet. During rendering, the image is scaled to fit this layout
  size.</p>

  <p>The size of the coordinate space does not necessarily represent
  the size of the actual bitmap that the user agent will use
  internally or during rendering. On high-definition displays, for
  instance, the user agent may internally use a bitmap with two device
  pixels per unit in the coordinate space, so that the rendering
  remains at high quality throughout.</p>

  <p>If the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes are
  dynamically modified, the bitmap and any associated contexts must be
  cleared back to their initial state and reinitialised with the newly
  specified coordinate space dimensions.</p>

  <p>The canvas is initially fully transparent black. Whenever the
  <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes are changed,
  the canvas must be cleared back to this state.</p> <!-- or should it
  be cropped? -->

  <p>As with any replaced element, the CSS background properties do
  apply to <code>canvas</code> elements; they are rendered below the
  canvas image.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>HTMLCanvasElement</dfn> : <span>HTMLElement</span> {

  // returns the values of the width and height attributes, or the assumed
  // defaults if the attributes were not specified or invalid
  // sets the relevant content attributes on setting
         attribute long                    width;
         attribute long                    height;

  // returns a data: URI representing the current image as a PNG
  DOMString <span>toDataURL()</span>;

  // returns a data: URI representing the current image in the specified format
  DOMString <span title="toDataURL-type">toDataURL</span>(in DOMString type);

  // returns the context with which to paint, see below
  DOMObject <span>getContext</span>(in DOMString contextID);
<!-- XXX?
  void showFallback();
-->
};</pre>

  <p>To draw on the canvas, authors must first obtain a reference to a
  <dfn>context</dfn> using the <dfn><code>getContext</code></dfn>
  method of the <code>canvas</code> element.</p>

  <p>This specification only defines one context, with the name
  "<code>2d</code>". If <code>getContext()</code> is called with that
  exact string, then the UA must return a reference to an object
  implementing <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code>. Other
  specifications may define their own contexts, which would return
  different objects.</p>

  <p>Vendors may also define experimental contexts using the syntax
  <code><var title="">vendorname</var>-<var title="">context</var></code>, for example,
  <code>moz-3d</code>.</p>

  <p>When the UA is passed an empty string or a string specifying a
  context that it does not support, then it must return null. String
  comparisons should be literal and case-sensitive.</p>

  <p class="note">A future version of this specification will probably
  define a <code>3d</code> context (probably based on the OpenGL ES
  API).</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>toDataURL()</code></dfn> method must, when called
  with no arguments, return a <code>data:</code> URI containing a
  representation of the image as a PNG file. <a
  href="#refsPNG">[PNG]</a>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="toDataURL-type"><code>toDataURL(<var title="">type</var>)</code></dfn>
  method (when called with one <em>or more</em> arguments) must return
  a <code>data:</code> URI containing a representation of the image in
  the format given by <var title="">type</var>. The possible values are MIME
  types with no parameters, for example <code>image/png</code>,
  <code>image/jpeg</code>, or even maybe <code>image/svg+xml</code> if
  the implementation actually keeps enough information to reliably
  render an SVG image from the canvas.</p>

  <p>Only support for <code>image/png</code> is required. User agents
  may support other types. If the user agent does not support the
  requested type, it must return the image using the PNG format.</p>

  <p>User agents must convert the provided type to lower case before
  establishing if they support that type and before creating the
  <code>data:</code> URL.</p> <!-- XXX define "convert to lower case"
  -->

  <p class="note">When trying to use types other than
  <code>image/png</code>, authors can check if the image was really
  returned in the requested format by checking to see if the returned
  string starts with one the exact strings
  "<code>data:image/png,</code>" or "<code>data:image/png;</code>". If
  it does, the image is PNG, and thus the requested type was not
  supported.</p>

  <p>Arguments other than the <var title="">type</var> must be
  ignored, and must not cause the user agent to raise an exception (as
  would normally occur if a method was called with the wrong number of
  arguments). A future version of this specification will probably
  allow extra parameters to be passed to <code>toDataURL()</code> to
  allow authors to more carefully control compression settings, image
  metadata, etc.</p>

  <p><strong>Security:</strong> To prevent <em>information
  leakage</em>, the <code>toDataURL()</code> and
  <code>getImageData()</code> methods should raise a <span>security
  exception</span> if the canvas ever had images painted on it that
  originate from a domain other than the <span title="script's
  domain">domain of the script</span> that painted the images onto the
  canvas.</p>

  <h4>The 2D context</h4>

  <p>When the <code>getContext()</code> method of a
  <code>canvas</code> element is invoked with
  <dfn><code>2d</code></dfn> as the argument, a
  <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> object is returned.</p>

  <p>There is only one <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> object
  per canvas, so calling the <code>getContext()</code> method with the
  <code>2d</code> argument a second time must return the same
  object.</p>

  <p>The 2D context represents a flat cartesian surface whose origin
  (0,0) is at the top left corner, with the coordinate space having x
  values increasing when going right, and y values increasing when
  going down.</p>

   <code>lineCap</code>, <code>lineJoin</code>,
   <code>miterLimit</code>, <code>shadowOffsetX</code>,
   <code>shadowOffsetY</code>, <code>shadowBlur</code>,
   <code>shadowColor</code>,
   <code>globalCompositeOperation</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">The current path and the current bitmap are not part
  of the drawing state. The current path is persistent, and can only
  be reset using the <code>beginPath()</code> method. The current
  bitmap is <span title="image">a property of the canvas</span>, not
  the context.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>save()</code></dfn> method pushes a copy of the
  current drawing state onto the drawing state stack.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>restore()</code></dfn> method pops the top entry
  in the drawing state stack, and resets the drawing state it
  describes. If there is no saved state, the method does nothing.</p>


  <h5><dfn>Transformations</dfn></h5>

  <p>The transformation matrix is applied to all drawing operations
  prior to their being rendered. It is also applied when creating the
  clip region.</p> <!-- conformance criteria for actual drawing are
  described in "drawing model" below -->

  <p>When the context is created, the transformation matrix must
  initially be the identity transform. It may then be adjusted using
  the three transformation methods.</p>

  <p>The transformations must be performed in reverse order. For
  instance, if a scale transformation that doubles the width is
  applied, followed by a rotation transformation that rotates drawing
  operations by a quarter turn, and a rectangle twice as wide as it is
  tall is then drawn on the canvas, the actual result will be a
  square.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="scale"><code>scale(x, y)</code></dfn> method must
  add the scaling transformation described by the arguments to the
  transformation matrix. The <code>x</code> argument represents the
  scale factor in the horizontal direction and the <code>y</code>
  argument represents the scale factor in the vertical direction. The
  factors are multiples.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="rotate"><code>rotate(angle)</code></dfn> method
  must add the rotation transformation described by the argument to
  the transformation matrix. The <code>angle</code> argument
  represents a clockwise rotation angle expressed in radians.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="translate"><code>translate(x, y)</code></dfn>
  method must add the translation transformation described by the
  arguments to the transformation matrix. The <code>x</code> argument
  represents the translation distance in the horizontal direction and
  the <code>y</code> argument represents the translation distance in
  the vertical direction. The arguments are in coordinate space
  units.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="transform"><code>transform(m11, m12, m21, m22, dx,
  dy)</code></dfn> method must multiply the current transformation
  matrix with the matrix described by:</p>

  <table class="matrix">
   <tr>
    <td>m11</td>
    <td>m12</td>
    <td>dx</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>m21</td>
    <td>m22</td>
    <td>dy</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
   </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The <dfn title="setTransform"><code>setTransform(m11, m12, m21,
  m22, dx, dy)</code></dfn> method must reset the current transform to
  the identity matrix, and then invoke the <code>transform(m11, m12,
  m21, m22, dx, dy)</code> method with the same arguments.</p>


  <h5>Compositing</h5>

  <p>All drawing operations are affected by the global compositing
  attributes, <code>globalAlpha</code> and
  <code>globalCompositeOperation</code>.</p>

  <!-- conformance criteria for painting are described in the "drawing
  model" section below -->

  <p>The <dfn><code>globalAlpha</code></dfn> attribute gives an alpha
  value that is applied to shapes and images before they are
  composited onto the canvas. The valid range of values is from 0.0
  (fully transparent) to 1.0 (no additional transparency). If an
  attempt is made to set the attribute to a value outside this range,
  the attribute must retain its previous value.  When the context is
  created, the <code>globalAlpha</code> attribute must initially have
  the value 1.0.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>globalCompositeOperation</code></dfn> attribute
  sets how shapes and images are drawn onto the existing bitmap, once
  they have had <code>globalAlpha</code> and the current
  transformation matrix applied. It may be set to any of the values in
  the following list. In the descriptions below, the source image is
  the shape or image being rendered, and the destination image is the
  current state of the bitmap.</p>

  <p class="issue">The source-* descriptions below don't define what
  should happen with semi-transparent regions.</p>

  <dl>

   should use this syntax.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>These values are all case-sensitive &mdash; they must be used
  exactly as shown. User agents must only recognise values that
  exactly match the values given above.</p>

  <p>On setting, if the user agent does not recognise the specified
  value, it must be ignored, leaving the value of
  <code>globalCompositeOperation</code> unaffected.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the
  <code>globalCompositeOperation</code> attribute must initially have
  the value <code>source-over</code>.</p>


  <h5>Colours and styles</h5>

  <p>The <dfn><code>strokeStyle</code></dfn> attribute represents the
  colour or style to use for the lines around shapes, and the
  <dfn><code>fillStyle</code></dfn> attribute represents the colour or
  style to use inside the shapes.</p>

  <p>Both attributes can be either strings,
  <code>CanvasGradient</code>s, or <code>CanvasPattern</code>s. On
  setting, strings should be parsed as CSS &lt;color&gt; values.
  <a href="#refsCSS3COLOR">[CSS3COLOR]</a> If the value is a string
  but is not a valid colour, or is neither a string, a
  <code>CanvasGradient</code>, nor a <code>CanvasPattern</code>, then
  it must be ignored, and the attribute must retain its previous
  value.</p>

  <p>On getting, if the value is a color, then: if it has alpha equal
  to 1.0, then the colour must be returned as an uppercase six-digit
  hex value, prefixed with a "#" character (U+0023 NUMBER SIGN), with
  the first two digits representing the red component, the next two
  digits representing the green component, and the last two digits
  representing the blue component, the digits being in the range 0-9
  A-F (U+0030 to U+0039 and U+0041 to U+0046). If the value has alpha
  less than 1.0, then the value must instead be returned in the CSS
  <code>rgba()</code> functional-notation format: the literal string
  <code>rgba</code> (U+0072 U+0067 U+0062 U+0061) followed by a U+0028
  LEFT PARENTHESIS, a base-ten integer in the range 0-255 representing
  the red component (using digits 0-9, U+0030 to U+0039, in the
  shortest form possible), a literal U+002C COMMA and U+0020 SPACE, an
  integer for the green component, a comma and a space, an integer for
  the blue component, another comma and space, a U+0030 DIGIT ZERO, a
  U+002E FULL STOP (representing the decimal point), one or more
  digits in the range 0-9 (U+0030 to U+0039) representing the
  fractional part of the alpha value, and finally a U+0029 RIGHT
  PARENTHESIS.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if it is not a color but a <code>CanvasGradient</code>
  or <code>CanvasPattern</code>, then an object supporting those
  interfaces must be returned. Such objects are opaque and therefore
  only useful for assigning to other attributes or for comparison to
  other gradients or patterns.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code>strokeStyle</code> and
  <code>fillStyle</code> attributes must initially have the string
  value <code>#000000</code>.</p>

  <p>There are two types of gradients, linear gradients and radial
  gradients, both represented by objects implementing the opaque
  <dfn><code>CanvasGradient</code></dfn> interface.</p>

  <p>Once a gradient has been created (see below), stops must be
  placed along it to define how the colours are distributed along the
  gradient. Between each such stop, the colours and the alpha
  component are interpolated over the RGBA space to find the colour to
  use at that offset. Immediately before the 0 offset and immediately
  after the 1 offset, transparent black stops are assumed.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="addColorStop"><code>addColorStop(offset,
  color)</code></dfn> method on the <code>CanvasGradient</code>
  interface adds a new stop to a gradient. If the <var title="">offset</var> is
  less than 0 or greater than 1 then an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception is raised. If the <var title="">color</var> cannot be parsed as a
  CSS colour, then a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception is raised.
  Otherwise, the gradient is updated with the new stop
  information.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="createLinearGradient"><code>createLinearGradient(x0, y0, x1,
  y1)</code></dfn> method takes four arguments, representing the start
  point (<var title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) and end point (<var title="">x1</var>,
  <var title="">y1</var>) of the gradient, in coordinate space units, and
  returns a linear <code>CanvasGradient</code> initialised with that
  line.</p>

  <p>Linear gradients are rendered such that at the starting point on
  the canvas the colour at offset 0 is used, that at the ending
  point the color at offset 1 is used, that all points on a line
  perpendicular to the line between the start and end points have the
  colour at the point where those two lines cross, and that any points
  beyond the start or end points are a transparent black. (Of course,
  the colours are only painted where the shape they are being painted
  on needs them.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="createRadialGradient"><code>createRadialGradient(x0, y0, r0,
  x1, y1, r1)</code></dfn> method takes six arguments, the first three
  representing the start circle with origin (<var title="">x0</var>,
  <var title="">y0</var>) and radius <var title="">r0</var>, and the last three
  representing the end circle with origin (<var title="">x1</var>,
  <var title="">y1</var>) and radius <var title="">r1</var>. The values are in
  coordinate space units. The method returns a radial
  <code>CanvasGradient</code> initialised with those two circles.</p>

  <p>Radial gradients are rendered such that a cone is created from
  the two circles, so that at the circumference of the starting circle
  the colour at offset 0 is used, that at the circumference around the
  ending circle the color at offset 1 is used, that the circumference
  of a circle drawn a certain fraction of the way along the line
  between the two origins with a radius the same fraction of the way
  between the two radii has the colour at that offset, that the end
  circle appear to be above the start circle when the end circle is
  not completely enclosed by the start circle, and that any points not
  described by the gradient are a transparent black.</p>

  <p>If a gradient has no stops defined, then the gradient is treated
  as a solid transparent black. Gradients are, naturally, only painted
  where the stroking or filling effect requires that they be
  drawn.</p>

  <p>Support for actually painting gradients is optional. Instead of
  painting the gradients, user agents may instead just paint the first
  stop's colour. However, <code>createLinearGradient()</code> and
  <code>createRadialGradient()</code> must always return objects when
  passed valid arguments.</p>

  <p>Patterns are represented by objects implementing the opaque
  <dfn><code>CanvasPattern</code></dfn> interface.</p>

  <p>To create objects of this type, the <dfn
  title="createPattern"><code>createPattern(image,
  repetition)</code></dfn> method is used. The first argument gives
  the image to use as the pattern (either an
  <code>HTMLImageElement</code> or an <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code>).
  Modifying this image after calling the <code>createPattern()</code>
  method must not affect the pattern. The second argument must be a
  string with one of the following values: <code>repeat</code>,
  <code>repeat-x</code>, <code>repeat-y</code>,
  <code>no-repeat</code>. If the empty string or null is specified,
  <code>repeat</code> is assumed. If an unrecognised value is given,
  then the user agent must raise a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code>
  exception. User agents must recognise the four values described
  above exactly (e.g. they must not do case folding). The method
  returns a <code>CanvasPattern</code> object suitably
  initialised.</p>

  <p>The <var title="">image</var> argument must be an instance of an
  <code>HTMLImageElement</code> or <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code>. If
  the <var title="">image</var> is of the wrong type, the
  implementation must raise a <code>TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p>Patterns are painted so that the top left of the first image is
  anchored at the origin of the coordinate space, and images are then
  repeated horizontally to the left and right (if the
  <code>repeat-x</code> string was specified) or vertically up and
  down (if the <code>repeat-y</code> string was specified) or in all
  four directions all over the canvas (if the <code>repeat</code>
  string was specified). The images are not be scaled by this process;
  one CSS pixel of the image must be painted on one coordinate space
  unit. Of course, patterns must only actually painted where the
  stroking or filling effect requires that they be drawn, and are
  affected by the current transformation matrix.</p>

  <p>Support for patterns is optional. If the user agent doesn't
  support patterns, then <code>createPattern()</code> must return
  null.</p>


  <h5>Line styles</h5>

  <p>The <dfn><code>lineWidth</code></dfn> attribute gives the default
  width of lines, in coordinate space units. On setting, zero and
  negative values must be ignored, leaving the value unchanged.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code>lineWidth</code> attribute
  must initially have the value <code>1.0</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>lineCap</code></dfn> attribute defines the type of
  endings that UAs shall place on the end of lines. The three valid
  values are <code>butt</code>, <code>round</code>, and
  <code>square</code>. The <code>butt</code> value means that the end
  of each line is a flat edge perpendicular to the direction of the
  line. The <code>round</code> value means that a semi-circle with the
  diameter equal to the width of the line is then added on to the end
  of the line. The <code>square</code> value means that at the end of
  each line is a rectangle with the length of the line width and the
  width of half the line width, placed flat against the edge
  perpendicular to the direction of the line. On setting, any other
  value than the literal strings <code>butt</code>,
  <code>round</code>, and <code>square</code> must be ignored,
  leaving the value unchanged.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code>lineCap</code> attribute
  must initially have the value <code>butt</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>lineJoin</code></dfn> attribute defines the type
  of corners that that UAs shall place where two lines meet. The three
  valid values are <code>round</code>, <code>bevel</code>, and
  <code>miter</code>.</p>

  <p>On setting, any other value than the literal strings
  <code>round</code>, <code>bevel</code> and <code>miter</code> must
  be ignored, leaving the value unchanged.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code>lineJoin</code> attribute
  must initially have the value <code>miter</code>.</p>

  <p>The <code>round</code> value means that a filled arc connecting
  the corners on the outside of the join, with the diameter equal to
  the line width, and the origin at the point where the inside edges
  of the lines touch, is rendered at the join. The <code>bevel</code>
  value means that a filled triangle connecting those two corners with
  a straight line, the third point of the triangle being the point
  where the lines touch on the inside of the join, is rendered at the
  join. The <code>miter</code> value means that a filled four- or
  five-sided polygon is placed at the join, with two of the lines
  being the perpendicular edges of the joining lines, and the other
  two being continuations of the outside edges of the two joining
  lines, as long as required to intersect without going over the miter
  limit.</p>

  <p>The miter length is the distance from the point where the lines
  touch on the inside of the join to the intersection of the line
  edges on the outside of the join. The miter limit is the maximum
  allowed ratio of the miter length to the line width. If the miter
  limit would be exceeded, then a fifth line is added to the polygon,
  connecting the two outside lines, such that the distance from the
  inside point of the join to the point in the middle of this fifth
  line is the maximum allowed value for the miter length.</p>

  <p>The miter limit ratio can be explicitly set using the
  <dfn><code>miterLimit</code></dfn> attribute. On setting, zero and
  negative values must be ignored, leaving the value unchanged.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code>miterLimit</code>
  attribute must initially have the value <code>10.0</code>.</p>


  <h5><dfn>Shadows</dfn></h5>

  <p>All drawing operations are affected by the four global shadow
  attributes. Shadows form part of the source image during
  composition.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>shadowColor</code></dfn> attribute sets the colour
  of the shadow.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code>shadowColor</code>
  attribute initially must be fully-transparent black.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>shadowOffsetX</code></dfn> and
  <dfn><code>shadowOffsetY</code></dfn> attributes specify the
  distance that the shadow should be offset in the positive horizontal
  and positive vertical distance respectively. Their values are in
  coordinate space units.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the shadow offset
  attributes initially have the value <code>0</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>shadowBlur</code></dfn> attribute specifies the
  number of coordinate space units that the blurring should cover. On
  setting, negative numbers must be ignored, leaving the attribute
  unmodified.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code>shadowBlur</code>
  attribute must initially have the value <code>0</code>.</p>

  <p>Support for shadows is optional.</p>


  <h5>Simple shapes (rectangles)</h5>

  <p>There are three methods that immediately draw rectangles to the
  bitmap. They each take four arguments; the first two give the
  <var title="">x</var> and <var title="">y</var> coordinates of the top left of the
  rectangle, and the second two give the width and height of the
  rectangle, respectively.</p>

  <p>Shapes are painted without affecting the current path, and are
  subject to <span>transformations</span>, <span
  title="shadows">shadow effects</span>, <span
  title="globalAlpha">global alpha</span>, <span title="clipping
  path">clipping paths</span>, and <span
  title="globalCompositeOperation">global composition
  operators</span>.</p>

  <p>Negative values for width and height must cause the
  implementation to raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>clearRect()</code></dfn> method must clear the
  pixels in the specified rectangle to a fully transparent black,
  erasing any previous image. If either height or width are zero, this
  method has no effect.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>fillRect()</code></dfn> method must paint the
  specified rectangular area using the <code>fillStyle</code>. If
  either height or width are zero, this method has no effect.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>strokeRect()</code></dfn> method must draw a
  rectangular outline of the specified size using the
  <code>strokeStyle</code>, <code>lineWidth</code>,
  <code>lineJoin</code>, and (if appropriate) <code>miterLimit</code>
  attributes. <span title="issue">What should happen with zero heights
  or widths?</span></p>


  <h5>Complex shapes (paths)</h5>

  <p>The context always has a current path. There is only one current
  path, it is not part of the <span>drawing state</span>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>path</dfn> has a list of zero or more subpaths. Each
  subpath consists of a list of one or more points, connected by
  straight or curved lines, and a flag indicating whether the subpath
  is closed or not. A closed subpath is one where the last point of
  the subpath is connected to the first point of the subpath by a
  straight line. Subpaths with fewer than two points are ignored when
  painting the path.</p>

  <p>Initially, the context's path must have zero subpaths.</p>


  <p>The <dfn><code>beginPath()</code></dfn> method must empty the
  list of subpaths so that the context once again has zero
  subpaths.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="moveTo"><code>moveTo(x, y)</code></dfn> method
  must create a new subpath with the specified point as its first (and
  only) point.</p>


  <p>The <dfn><code>closePath()</code></dfn> method must do nothing if
  the context has no subpaths. Otherwise, it must mark the last
  subpath as closed, create a new subpath whose first point is the
  same as the previous subpath's first point, and finally add this new
  subpath to the path. (If the last subpath had more than one point in
  its list of points, then this is equivalent to adding a straight
  line connecting the last point back to the first point, thus
  "closing" the shape, and then repeating the last
  <code>moveTo()</code> call.) </p>


  <p>New points and the lines connecting them are added to subpaths
  using the methods described below. In all cases, the methods only
  modify the last subpath in the context's paths.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="lineTo"><code>lineTo(x, y)</code></dfn> method
  must do nothing if the context has no subpaths. Otherwise, it must
  connect the last point in the subpath to the given point (<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>) using a straight line, and
  must then add the given point (<var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>) to the subpath.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="quadraticCurveTo"><code>quadraticCurveTo(cpx,
  cpy, x, y)</code></dfn> method must do nothing if the context has no
  subpaths. Otherwise it must connect the last point in the subpath to
  the given point (<var title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>) by a
  quadratic curve with control point (<var title="">cpx</var>, <var
  title="">cpy</var>), and must then add the given point (<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>) to the subpath.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="bezierCurveTo"><code>bezierCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y,
  cp2x, cp2y, x, y)</code></dfn> method must do nothing if the context
  has no subpaths. Otherwise, it must connect the last point in the
  subpath to the given point (<var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>) using a bezier curve with control points (<var
  title="">cp1x</var>, <var title="">cp1y</var>) and (<var
  title="">cp2x</var>, <var title="">cp2y</var>). Then, it must add
  the point (<var title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>) to the
  subpath.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="arcTo"><code>arcTo(x1, y1, x2, y2,
  radius)</code></dfn> method must do nothing if the context has no
  subpaths. If the context <em>does</em> have a subpath, then the
  behaviour depends on the arguments and the last point in the
  subpath.</p>

  <p>Let the point (<var title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) be
  the last point in the subpath. Let <var title="">The Arc</var> be
  the shortest arc given by circumference of the circle that has one
  point tangent to the line defined by the points (<var
  title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) and (<var
  title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>), another point tangent to
  the line defined by the points (<var title="">x1</var>, <var
  title="">y1</var>) and (<var title="">x2</var>, <var
  title="">y2</var>), and that has radius <var
  title="">radius</var>. The points at which this circle touches these
  two lines are called the start and end tangent points
  respectively.</p>

  <p>If the point (<var title="">x2</var>, <var title="">y2</var>) is
  on the line defined by the points (<var title="">x0</var>, <var
  title="">y0</var>) and (<var title="">x1</var>, <var
  title="">y1</var>) then the method must do nothing, as no arc would
  satisfy the above constraints.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the method must connect the point (<var
  title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) to the start tangent
  point by a straight line, then connect the start tangent point to
  the end tangent point by <var title="">The Arc</var>, and finally
  add the start and end tangent points to the subpath.</p>

  <p>Negative or zero values for <var title="">radius</var> must cause
  the implementation to raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="arc"><code>arc(x, y, radius, startAngle,
  endAngle, anticlockwise)</code></dfn> method draws an arc. If the
  context has any subpaths, then the method must add a straight line
  from the last point in the subpath to the start point of the arc. In
  any case, it must draw the arc between the start point of the arc
  and the end point of the arc, and add the start and end points of
  the arc to the subpath. The arc and its start and end points are
  defined as follows:</p>

  <p>Consider a circle that has its origin at (<var title="">x</var>,
  <var title="">y</var>) and that has radius <var
  title="">radius</var>. The points at <var title="">startAngle</var>
  and <var title="">endAngle</var> along the circle's circumference,
  measured in radians clockwise from the positive x-axis, are the
  start and end points respectively. The arc is the path along the
  circumference of this circle from the start point to the end point,
  going anti-clockwise if the <var title="">anticlockwise</var>
  argument is true, and clockwise otherwise.</p>

  <p>Negative or zero values for <var title="">radius</var> must cause
  the implementation to raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="rect"><code>rect(x, y, w, h)</code></dfn> method
  must create a new subpath containing just the four points (<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>), (<var
  title="">x</var>+<var title="">w</var>, <var title="">y</var>),
  (<var title="">x</var>+<var title="">w</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>+<var title="">h</var>), (<var title="">x</var>,
  <var title="">y</var>+<var title="">h</var>), with those four points
  connected by straight lines, and must then mark the subpath as
  closed. It must then create a new subpath with the point (<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>) as the only point in the
  subpath.</p>

  <p>Negative values for <var title="">w</var> and <var
  title="">h</var> must cause the implementation to raise an
  <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception.</p>


  <p>The <dfn><code>fill()</code></dfn> method must fill each subpath
  of the current path in turn, using <code>fillStyle</code>, and using
  the non-zero winding number rule. Open subpaths must be implicitly
  closed when being filled (without affecting the actual
  subpaths).</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>stroke()</code></dfn> method must stroke each
  subpath of the current path in turn, using the
  <code>strokeStyle</code>, <code>lineWidth</code>,
  <code>lineJoin</code>, and (if appropriate) <code>miterLimit</code>
  attributes.</p>

  <p>Paths, when filled or stroked, must be painted without affecting
  the current path, and must be subject to
  <span>transformations</span>, <span title="shadows">shadow
  effects</span>, <span title="globalAlpha">global alpha</span>, <span
  title="clipping path">clipping paths</span>, and <span
  title="globalCompositeOperation">global composition
  operators</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The transformation is applied to the path when it is
  drawn, not when the path is constructed. Thus, a single path can be
  constructed and then drawn according to different transformations
  without recreating the path.</p>


  <p>The <dfn><code>clip()</code></dfn> method must create a new
  <dfn>clipping path</dfn> by calculating the intersection of the
  current clipping path and the area described by the current path
  (after applying the <span>current transformation</span>), using the
  non-zero winding number rule. Open subpaths must be implicitly
  closed when computing the clipping path, without affecting the
  actual subpaths.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the initial clipping path is the
  rectangle with the top left corner at (0,0) and the width and height
  of the coordinate space.</p>


  <p>The <dfn
  title="isPointInPath"><code>isPointInPath(<var title="">x</var>,
  <var title="">y</var>)</code></dfn> method must return true if the point
  given by the <var title="">x</var> and <var title="">y</var> coordinates passed to the
  method, when treated as coordinates in the canvas' coordinate space
  unaffected by the current transformation, is within the area of the
  canvas that is inside the current path; and must return false
  otherwise.</p>



  <h5>Images</h5>

  <p>To draw images onto the canvas, the
  <dfn><code>drawImage</code></dfn> method may be used.</p>

  <p>This method is overloaded with three variants:
  <code>drawImage(image, dx, dy)</code>, <code>drawImage(image, dx,
  dy, dw, dh)</code>, and <code>drawImage(image, sx, sy, sw, sh, dx,
  dy, dw, dh)</code>. (Actually it is overloaded with six; each of
  those three can take either an <code>HTMLImageElement</code> or an
  <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code> for the <var title="">image</var> argument.)
  If not specified, the <var title="">dw</var> and <var title="">dh</var> arguments
  default to the values of <var title="">sw</var> and <var title="">sh</var>,
  interpreted such that one CSS pixel in the image is treated as one
  unit in the canvas coordinate space. If the <var title="">sx</var>,
  <var title="">sy</var>, <var title="">sw</var>, and <var title="">sh</var> arguments are
  omitted, they default to 0, 0, the image's intrinsic width in image
  pixels, and the image's intrinsic height in image pixels,
  respectively.</p>

  <p>The <var title="">image</var> argument must be an instance of an
  <code>HTMLImageElement</code> or <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code>. If
  the <var title="">image</var> is of the wrong type, the implementation must
  raise a <code>TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR</code> exception. If one of the
  <var title="">sy</var>, <var title="">sw</var>, <var title="">sw</var>, and <var title="">sh</var>
  arguments is outside the size of the image, or if one of the
  <var title="">dw</var> and <var title="">dh</var> arguments is negative, the
  implementation must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p>When <code>drawImage</code> is invoked, the specified region of
  the image specified by the source rectangle (<var title="">sx</var>,
  <var title="">sy</var>, <var title="">sw</var>, <var
  title="">sh</var>) must be painted on the region of the canvas
  specified by the destination rectangle (<var title="">dx</var>, <var
  title="">dy</var>, <var title="">dw</var>, <var
  title="">dh</var>).</p>

  <p><img src="drawImage.png" alt=""></p> <!-- no alt="" text since
  the image is just repeating what was stated in the previous
  paragraph. -->

  <p>Images are painted without affecting the current path, and are
  subject to <span>transformations</span>, <span
  title="shadows">shadow effects</span>, <span
  title="globalAlpha">global alpha</span>, <span title="clipping
  path">clipping paths</span>, and <span
  title="globalCompositeOperation">global composition
  operators</span>.</p>

  <!-- XXX should somehow say that the image used is the actual image
  of the target element, not the rendered image (e.g. height/width
  attributes don't affect it -->


  <h5><dfn>Pixel manipulation</dfn></h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="getImageData"><code>getImageData(sx, sy, sw,
  sh)</code></dfn> method must return an <code>ImageData</code> object
  representing the underlying pixel data for the area of the canvas
  denoted by the rectangle which has one corner at the (<var title="">sx</var>,
  <var title="">sy</var>) coordinate, and that has width <var title="">sw</var> and
  height <var title="">sh</var>. Pixels outside the canvas must be returned as
  transparent black.</p>

  <p><code>ImageData</code> objects must be initialised so that their
  <dfn title="dom-imagedata-height"><code>height</code></dfn>
  attribute is set to <var title="">h</var>, the number of rows in the image
  data, their <dfn
  title="dom-imagedata-width"><code>width</code></dfn> attribute is
  set to <var title="">w</var>, the number of physical device pixels per row in
  the image data, and the <dfn
  title="dom-imagedata-data"><code>data</code></dfn> attribute is
  initialised to an array of <var title="">h</var>&times;<var title="">w</var>&times;4
  integers. The pixels must be represented in this array in
  left-to-right order, row by row, starting at the top left, with each
  pixel's red, green, blue, and alpha components being given in that
  order. Each component of each device pixel represented in this array
  must be in the range 0..255, representing the 8 bit value for that
  component.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="putImageData"><code>putImageData(image, dx,
  dy)</code></dfn> method must take the given <code>ImageData</code>
  structure, and draw it at the specified location
  <var title="">dx</var>,<var title="">dy</var> in the canvas coordinate space, mapping
  each pixel represented by the <code>ImageData</code> structure into
  one device pixel.</p>

  <p>The handling of pixel rounding when the specified coordinates do
  not exactly map to the device coordinate space is not defined by
  this specification, except that the following must result in no
  visible changes to the rendering:</p>

  <pre>context.putImageData(context.getImageData(x, y, w, h), x, y);</pre>

  <p>...for any value of <var title="">x</var> and <var
  title="">y</var>. In other words, while user agents may round the
  arguments of the two methods so that they map to device pixel
  boundaries, any rounding performed must be performed consistently
  for both the <code>getImageData()</code> and
  <code>putImageData()</code> operations.</p>

  <p>The current transformation matrix must not affect the
  <code>getImageData()</code> and <code>putImageData()</code>
  methods.</p>



  <h5>Drawing model</h5>

  <p>When a shape or image is painted, user agents must follow these
  steps, in the order given (or act as if they do):</p>

  <ol>

   <li>The coordinates are transformed by the current transformation
   matrix.</li>

   <li>The shape or image is rendered, creating image <var
   title="">A</var>, as described in the previous sections. For
   shapes, the current fill, stroke, and line styles must be
   honoured.</li>

   <li>The shadow is rendered from image <var title="">A</var>, using
   the current shadow styles, creating image <var
   title="">B</var>.</li>

   <li>Image <var title="">A</var> is composited over image <var
   title="">B</var> creating the source image.</li>

   <li>The source image has its alpha adjusted by
   <code>globalAlpha</code>.</li>

   <li>Within the clip region (as affected by the current
   transformation matrix), the source image is composited over the
   current canvas bitmap using the current composition operator.</li>

  </ol>



  <h4>The 3D context</h4>

  <p class="big-issue">Well, one day.</p>



  <h3><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Sound</h3>

  <p>The <code>Audio</code> interface allows scripts to play sound
  clips. This interface is intended for sound effects, not for
  streaming audio or multimedia; for the latter, the
  <code>object</code> element is more appropriate. <span
  class="issue">We need to add an API for object to support pausing,
  etc, of streaming APIs.</span></p>

  <p>There is no markup element that corresponds to <code>Audio</code>
  objects, they are only accessible from script.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow users to dynamically enable and disable
  sound output, but doing so must not affect how <code>Audio</code>
  objects act in any way other than whether sounds are physically
  played back or not. For instance, sound files must still be
  downloaded, <code>load</code> and <code>error</code> events must
  still fire, and if two identical clips are started with a two second
  interval then when the sound is reenabled they must still be two
  seconds out of sync.</p>

  <p>When multiple sounds are played simultaneously, the user agent
  must mix the sounds together.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>Audio</dfn> {<!-- XXX xrefs -->
           attribute EventListener onload;
           attribute EventListener onerror;
  void play();
  void loop();
  void loop(in unsigned long playCount);
  void stop();
};</pre>

  <p><code>Audio</code> objects must also implement the
  <code>EventTarget</code> interface. <a
  href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a>

<!-- XXXXXXX haven't checked conf stats below here -->

  <p>In ECMAScript, an instance of <code>Audio</code> can be created
  using the <code>Audio(<var title="">uri</var>)</code> constructor:</p>

  <pre class="example">var a = new Audio("test.wav");</pre>

  <p>The <dfn><code>Audio()</code> constructor</dfn> takes a single
  argument, a URI (or IRI), which is resolved using the script
  context's <code>window.location.href</code> value as the base, and
  which returns an <code>Audio</code> object that will, at the
  completion of the current script, start loading that URI.</p>

  <p>Once the URI is loaded, a <code>load</code> event must be fired
  on the <code>Audio</code> object.</p>

  <p><code>Audio</code> objects have a current position and a play
  count. Both are initially zero.</p>

  <p>The <code>Audio</code> interface has the following members:</p>

  <!-- XXX conf criteria -->
  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="Audio.onload">onload</dfn></dt>

   <dd>An event listener that is invoked along with any other
   appropriate event listeners that are registered on this object when
   a <code>load</code> event is fired on it.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="Audio.play">play()</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Begins playing the sound at the current position, setting the
   play count to 1.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="Audio.loop">loop()</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Begins playing the sound at the current position, setting the
   play count to infinity.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="Audio.loopN">loop(<var title="">playCount</var>)</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Begins playing the sound at the current position, setting the
   play count to <var title="">playCount</var>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="Audio.stop">stop()</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Stops playing the clip and resets the current position and
   play count to zero.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>When playback of the sound reaches the end of the available data,
  its current position is reset to the start of the clip, and the play
  count is decreased by one (unless it is infinite). If the play count
  is greater than zero, then the sound is played again.</p>

<!--
   var sound = new Audio("URI relative to document URI");
   sound.onload = function() { } // onload event handler
   sound.play(); // play once
   sound.loop(); // loop forever
   sound.loop(2); // play twice

  <h2 id="comms">Communication</h2>

  <h3><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Server-sent DOM events</h3>

  <p>This section describes a mechanism for allowing servers to
  dispatch DOM events into documents that expect it.</p>

  <h4>The <dfn><code>event-source</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <p>To specify an event source in an HTML document authors use a new
  (empty) element <code>event-source</code>, with an attribute
  <code>src=""</code> that takes a URI (or IRI) to open as a stream
  and, if the data found at that URI is of the appropriate type, treat
  as an event source.</p>

  <p>The <code>event-source</code> element may also have an
  <code>onevent=""</code> attribute. If present, the attribute must be
  treated as script representing an event handler registered as
  non-capture listener of events with name <code>event</code> and the
  namespace <code>uuid:755e2d2d-a836-4539-83f4-16b51156341f</code> or
  null, that are targetted at or bubble through the element.</p>

  <p>UAs must also support all the common attributes on the
  <code>event-source</code> element.</p>

  <h4>The <dfn><code>RemoteEventTarget</code></dfn> interface</h4>

  <p>Any object that implements the <code>EventTarget</code> interface
  shall also implement the <code>RemoteEventTarget</code> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>RemoteEventTarget</dfn> {
  void addEventSource(in DOMString src);
  void removeEventSource(in DOMString src);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="addEventSource"><code>addEventSource(<var title="">src</var>)</code></dfn>
  method shall register the URI (or IRI) specified in <var title="">src</var>
  as an event source on the object. The <dfn
  title="removeEventSource"><code>removeEventSource(<var title="">src</var>)</code></dfn>
  method shall remove the URI (or IRI) specified in <var title="">src</var>
  from the list of event sources for that object. If a single URI is
  added multiple times, each instance must be handled individually.
  Removing a URI must only remove one instance of that URI. If the
  specified URI cannot be added or removed, the method must return
  without doing anything or raising an exception.</p>

  <h4>Processing model</h4>

  <p>When an <code>event-source</code> element in a document has a
  <code>src</code> attribute set, the UA should fetch the resource
  indicated by the attribute's value.</p>

  <p>Similarly, when the <code>addEventSource()</code> method is
  invoked on an object, the UA should, at the completion of the
  script's current execution, fetch the resource identified by the
  method's argument (unless the <code>removeEventSource()</code> was
  called removing the URI from the list first).</p>

  <p>When an <code>event-source</code> element is removed from the
  document, or when an event source is removed from the list of event
  sources for an object using the <code>removeEventSource()</code>
  method, the relevant connection must be closed (and not reopened
  unless the element is returned to the document or the
  <code>addEventSource()</code> method is called with the same URI
  again).</p>

  <p class="issue">Should event-source elements be allowed to point to
  any remote server, or only origin hosts?</p>

  <p>Since connections established to remote servers for such
  resources are expected to be long-lived, UAs should ensure that
  appropriate buffering is used. In particular, while line buffering
  may be safe if lines are defined to end with a single U+000A LINE
  FEED character, block buffering or line buffering with different
  expected line endings can cause delays in event dispatch.</p>

  <p>In general, the semantics of the transport protocol specified by
  the "src" attribute must be followed. Clients should re-open
  <code>event-source</code> connections that get closed after a short
  interval (such as 5 seconds), unless they were closed due to
  problems that aren't expected to be resolved, as described in this
  section.</p>

  <p>DNS errors must be considered fatal, and cause the user agent to
  not open any connection for the event-source.</p>

  <p>HTTP 200 OK responses that have a Content-Type other than
  <code>application/x-dom-event-stream</code> must be ignored and must
  prevent the user agent from reopening the connection for that
  event-source. HTTP 200 OK responses with the right MIME type,
  however, should, when closed, be reopened after a small delay.</p>

  <p>Resource with the type
  <code>application/x-dom-event-stream</code> must be processed line
  by line <a href="#event-stream-interpretation">as described
  below</a>.</p>

  <p>HTTP 201 Created, 202 Accepted, 203 Non-Authoritative
  Information, and 206 Partial Content responses must be treated like
  HTTP 200 OK responses for the purposes of reopening event-source
  connections. They are, however, likely to indicate an error has
  occurred somewhere and may cause the user agent to emit a
  warning.</p>

  <p>HTTP 204 No Content, and 205 Reset Content responses must be
  treated as if they were 200 OK responses with the right MIME type
  but no content, and should therefore cause the user agent to reopen
  the connection after a short delay.</p>

  <p>HTTP 300 Multiple Choices responses should be handled
  automatically if possible (treating the responses as if they were
  302 Moved Permanently responses pointing to the appropriate
  resource), and otherwise must be treated as HTTP 404 responses.</p>

  <p>HTTP 301 Moved Permanently responses must cause the user agent to
  use the server specified URI instead of the one specified in the
  event-source's "src" attribute for future connections.</p>

  <p>HTTP 302 Found, 303 See Other, and 307 Temporary Redirect
  responses must cause the user agent to use the server specified URI
  instead of the one specified in the event-source's "src" attribute
  for the next connection, but if the user agent needs to reopen the
  connection at a later point, it must once again start from the "src"
  attribute (or the last URI given by a 301 Moved Permanently response
  in complicated cases where such responses are chained).</p>

  <p>HTTP 304 Not Modified responses should be handled like HTTP 200
  OK responses, with the content coming from the user agent cache. A
  new connection attempt should then be made after a short wait.</p>

  <p>HTTP 305 Use Proxy, HTTP 401 Unauthorized, and 407 Proxy Authentication
  Required should be treated transparently as for any other subresource.</p>

  <p>HTTP 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not
  Allowed, 406 Not Acceptable, 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict, 410 Gone,
  411 Length Required, 412 Precondition Failed, 413 Request Entity Too
  Large, 414 Request-URI Too Long, 415 Unsupported Media Type, 416 Requested
  Range Not Satisfiable, 417 Expectation Failed, 500 Internal Server Error,
  501 Not Implemented, 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable, 504 Gateway
  Timeout, and 505 HTTP Version Not Supported responses, and any other HTTP
  response code not listed here, should cause the user agent to stop trying
  to process this event-source element.</p>

  <p>For non-HTTP protocols, UAs should act in equivalent ways.</p>

  <h4>The event stream format</h4>

  <p>The event stream MIME type is <code>application/x-dom-event-stream</code>.</p>

  <p>The event stream must always be encoded as UTF-8. Line must
  always be terminated by a single U+000A LINE FEED character.</p>

  <p>The event stream format is (in pseudo-BNF):</p>

  <pre>&lt;stream&gt;  ::= &lt;event&gt;*
&lt;event&gt;   ::= [ &lt;comment&gt; | &lt;command&gt; | &lt;field&gt; ]* &lt;newline&gt;

&lt;comment&gt; ::= ';' &lt;data&gt; &lt;newline&gt;
&lt;command&gt; ::= ':' &lt;data&gt; &lt;newline&gt;
&lt;field&gt;   ::= &lt;name&gt; [ ':' &lt;space&gt;? &lt;data&gt; ]? &lt;newline&gt;

&lt;name&gt;    ::= one or more UNICODE characters other than ':', ';', and U+000A LINE FEED
&lt;data&gt;    ::= zero or more UNICODE characters other than U+000A LINE FEED
&lt;space&gt;   ::= a single U+0020 SPACE character (' ')
&lt;newline&gt; ::= a single U+000A LINE FEED character</pre>

  <p>Bytes that are not valid UTF-8 sequences must be interpreted as
  the U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.</p>

  <p>The stream is parsed by reading everything line by line, in
  blocks separated by blank lines (blank lines are those consisting of
  just a single lone line feed character). Comment lines (those
  starting with the character ';') and command lines (those starting
  with the character ':') are ignored. Command lines are reserved for
  future use and should not be used.</p>

  <p>For each non-blank, non-comment line, the field name is first
  taken. This is everything on the line up to but not including the
  first colon (':') or the line feed, whichever comes first. Then, if
  there was a colon, the data for that line is taken. This is
  everything after the colon, ignoring a single space after the colon
  if there is one, up to the end of the line. If there was no colon
  the data is the empty string.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>Field name: Field data</pre>
  <pre>This is a blank field</pre>
  <pre>1. These two lines: have the same data
2. These two lines:have the same data</pre>
  <pre>1. But these two lines:  do not
2. But these two lines: do not</pre>
  </div>

  <p>If a field name occurs multiple times, the data values for those
  lines are concatenated with a newline between them.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>For example, the following:</p>
  <pre>Test: Line 1
Foo: Bar
Test: Line 2</pre>
  <p>...is treated as having two fields, one called <code>Test</code> with the
  value <code>Line 1\nLine 2</code> (where <code>\n</code> represents a newline), and one
  called <code>Foo</code> with the value <code> Bar</code>.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="note">Since any random stream of characters matches the above
  format, there is no need to define any error handling.</p>

  <h4 id="event-stream-interpretation">Event stream interpretation</h4>

  <p>Once the fields have been parsed, they are interpreted as follows
  (these are case-sensitive exact comparisons):</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p><code title="">Event</code> is the name of the event. For example,
   <code title="">load</code>, <code title="">DOMActivate</code>,
   <code title="">updateTicker</code>. If there is no field with this name,
   then no event will be synthesised, and the other data will be
   ignored.</p></li>

   <li><p><code title="">Namespace</code> is the DOM3 namespace for the event.
   For normal DOM events this would be
   <code title="">http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code>. If it isn't
   specified the event namespace is null.</p></li>

   <li><p><code title="">Class</code> is the interface used for the event, for
   instance <code>Event</code>, <code>UIEvent</code>,
   <code>MutationEvent</code>, <code>KeyboardEvent</code>, etc. For
   compatibility with DOM3 Events, the values <code title="">UIEvents</code>,
   <code title="">MouseEvents</code>, <code title="">MutationEvents</code>, and
   <code title="">HTMLEvents</code> are valid values and must be treated
   respectively as meaning the interfaces <code>UIEvent</code>,
   <code>MouseEvent</code>, <code>MutationEvent</code>, and
   <code>Event</code>. (This value can therefore be used as the
   argument to <code title="">createEvent()</code>.) If the value is not
   specified it is defaulted based on the event name as follows:</p>

    <ul>
     <li><p>If <code title="">Namespace</code> is
     <code title="">http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code> or null and the
     <code title="">Event</code> field exactly matches one of the events
     specified by DOM3 Events in <a
     href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#Events-EventTypes-complete">section
     1.4.2 "Complete list of event types"</a>, then the Class defaults
     to the interface relevant for that event type. <a
     href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>
      <div class="example">
       <p>For example:</p>

       <pre>Event: click</pre>
       <p>...would cause <code title="">Class</code> to be treated as <code>MouseEvent</code>.</p>
      </div>
     </li>
     <li><p>If <code title="">Namespace</code> is
     <code>uuid:755e2d2d-a836-4539-83f4-16b51156341f</code> or null
     and the <code title="">Event</code> doesn't match any of the known events,
     then the <code>RemoteEvent</code> interface (described below) is
     used.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, if the UA doesn't have special knowledge of which
     class to use for the given event in the given namespace, then
     the <code>Event</code> interface is used.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is quite possible to give the wrong class for an event. This
    is equivalent to creating an event in the DOM using the DOM Event
    APIs, but using the wrong interface for it.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p><code title="">Bubbles</code> specifies whether the event is to bubble. If it is
   specified and has the value <code title="">No</code>, the event does not bubble. If
   it is specified and has any other value (including <code title="">no</code> or
   <code title="">No\n</code>) then the event bubbles. If it is not specified it is
   defaulted based on the event name as follows:</p>

    <ul>
     <li><p>If <code title="">Namespace</code> is <code title="">http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code>
     or null and the <code title="">Event</code> field exactly matches one of the events
     specified by DOM3 Events in <a 
     href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#Events-EventTypes-complete"
     >section 1.4.2 "Complete list of event types"</a>, then whether
     the event bubbles depends on whether the DOM3 Events spec specifies
     that that event should bubble or not.  <a
     href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

      <div class="example">
       <p>For example:</p>
       <pre>Event: load</pre>
       <p>...would cause <code title="">Bubbles</code> to be treated as <code title="">No</code>.</p>
      </div>

     </li>
     <li><p>Otherwise, if the UA doesn't have special knowledge of which
     class to use for the given event in the given namespace, then
     the event bubbles.</p></li>
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li><p><code title="">Cancelable</code> specifies whether the event may have its default
   action prevented. If it is specified and has the value <code title="">No</code>, the
   event may not have its default action prevented. If it is
   specified and has any other value (including <code title="">no</code> or <code title="">No\n</code>)
   then the event may be canceled. If it is not specified it is

     >section 1.4.2 "Complete list of event types"</a>, then whether
     the event is cancelable depends on whether the DOM3 Events spec
     specifies that that event should be cancelable or not.  <a
     href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

      <div class="example">
       <p>For example:</p>
       <pre>Event: load</pre>
       <p>...would cause <code title="">Cancelable</code> to be treated as <code title="">No</code>.</p>
      </diV>

     </li>
     <li><p>Otherwise, if the UA doesn't have special knowledge of which
     class to use for the given event in the given namespace, then
     the event may be canceled.</p></li>
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li><p><code title="">Target</code> is the element that the event is to be dispatched on.
   If its value starts with a <code title="">#</code> character then the remainder of
   the value represents an ID, and the event must be dispatched on
   the same node as would be obtained by the <code title="">getElementById()</code>
   method on the ownerDocument of the event-source element
   responsible for the event being dispatched.</p>

    <div class="example">
     <p>For example,</p>
     <pre>Target: #test</pre>
     <p>...would target the element with ID <code title="">test</code>.</p>
    </div>
   <p>If the value does not start with a <code title="">#</code> but has the literal value
   <code>Document</code>, then the event is dispatched at the <code title="">ownerDocument</code> of
   the <code>event-source</code> element responsible for the event being dispatched.</p>

   <p>Otherwise, the event is dispatched at the <code>event-source</code> element
   itself.</p></li>

   <li><p>Other fields depend on the interface specified (or possibly
   implied) by the <code title="">Class</code> field. If the specified interface has an
   attribute that exactly matches the name of the field, and the
   value of the field can be converted (using the type conversions
   defined in ECMAScript) to the type of the attribute, then it
   must be used. Any attributes (other than the <code>Event</code> interface
   attributes) that do not have matching fields are initialised to
   zero, null, false, or the empty string.</p>

    <div class="example">
     <p>For example:</p>
     <pre>; ...some other fields...
Class: MouseEvent
button: 2</pre>
     <p>...would result in a MouseEvent event that had
     <code>button</code> set to <code title="">2</code> but
     <code>screenX</code>, <code>screenY</code>, etc, set to 0, false,
     or null as appropriate.</p>
    </div>

   <p>If a field does not match any of the attributes on the event, it
   is ignored.</p>

    <div class="example">
     <p>For example:</p>
     <pre>Event: keypress
Class: MouseEvent
keyIdentifier: 0</pre>
     <p>...would result in a <code>MouseEvent</code> event with its
     fields all at their default values, with the event name being
     <code title="">keypress</code>. The <code>ctrlKey</code> field would be
     ignored. (If the author had not included the <code title="">Class</code>
     field explicitly, it would have just worked, since the class
     would have defaulted as described above.)</p>
    </div>
   </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Once a blank line is reached, an event of the appropriate type is
  synthesized and dispatched to the appropriate node as described by
  the fields above. No event is dispatched until a blank line has
  been received.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="">Event</code> field was omitted, then no event is
  synthesised and the data is ignored.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following stream contains four blocks yet synthesises no
   events, since none of the blocks have a field called
   <code title="">Event</code>. (The first block has just a comment, the second
   block has two fields with names "load" and "Target" respectively,
   the third block is empty, and the fourth block has two
   comments.)</p>

   <pre>; test

load
Target: #image1


; if any real events follow this block, they will not be affected by
; the "Target" and "load" fields above.
</pre>
  </div>

  <h4>The <code>RemoteEvent</code> interface</h4>

  <p>The <code>RemoteEvent</code> interface is defined as follows:</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>RemoteEvent</dfn> : Event {
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-RemoteEvent-data">data</span>;
  void <span title="dom-RemoteEvent-initRemoteEvent">initRemoteEvent(in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMString dataArg);
  void <span title="dom-RemoteEvent-initRemoteEventNS">initRemoteEventNS(in DOMString namespaceURI, in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMString dataArg);
};</pre><!-- XXX definitions missing in this section -->

  <p>Events that use the <code>RemoteEvent</code> interface never have any default
  action associated with them.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">I guess we should define those members.</p>


  <h4>Example</h4>

  <div class="example">

  <p>The following event description, once followed by a blank line:</p>
  <pre>Event: stock change
data: YHOO
data: -2
data: 10</pre>
  <p>...would cause an event <code>stock change</code> with the interface
  <code>RemoteEvent</code> to be dispatched on the <code>event-source</code> element, which
  would then bubble up the DOM, and whose <code>data</code> attribute would
  contain the string <code>YHOO\n-2\n10</code> (where <code>\n</code> again represents a
  newline).</p>

  <p>This could be used as follows:
  <pre>&lt;event-source src="http://stocks.example.com/ticker.php" id="stock"&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
document.getElementById('stock').addEventListener('stock change',
  function () {
    var data = event.data.split('\n');
    updateStocks(data[0], data[1], data[2]);
  }, false);
&lt;/script&gt</pre>
  <p>...where updateStocks is a function defined as:
  <pre>function updateStocks(symbol, delta, value) { ... }</pre>
  <p>...or some such.</p>
  </div>


  <h3><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Network connections</h3>

  <p>To enable Web applications to communicate with each other in
  local area networks, and to maintain bidirectional communications
  with their originating server, this specification introduces the
  <code>Connection</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <code>Window</code> interface provides three constructors for
  creating <code>Connection</code> objects: <code
  title="dom-TCPConnection">TCPConnection()</code>, for creating a
  direct (possibly encrypted) link to another node on the Internet
  using TCP/IP; <code
  title="dom-LocalBroadcastConnection">LocalBroadcastConnection()</code>,
  for creating a connection to any listening peer on a local network
  (which could be a local TCP/IP subnet using UDP, a Bluetooth PAN, or
  another kind of network infrastructure); and <code
  title="dom-PeerToPeerConnection">PeerToPeerConnection()</code>, for
  a direct peer-to-peer connection (which could again be over TCP/IP,
  Bluetooth, IrDA, or some other type of network).</p>

  <p class="note">This interface does not allow for raw access to the
  underlying network. For example, this interface could not be used to
  implement an IRC client without proxying messages through a custom
  server.</p>


  <h4>Introduction <span title="TBW">[TBW]</span></h4>

  <h4>The <code>Connection</code> interface</h4>
 
  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>Connection</dfn> {
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-Connection-network">network</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-Connection-peer">peer</span>;
  readonly attribute int <span title="dom-Connection-readyState">readyState</span>;
           attribute EventListener <span title="dom-Connection-onopen">onopen</span>;
           attribute EventListener <span title="dom-Connection-onread">onread</span>;
           attribute EventListener <span title="dom-Connection-onclose">onclose</span>;
  void <span title="dom-Connection-send">send</span>(in DOMString data);
  void <span title="dom-Connection-disconnect">disconnect</span>();
};</pre>

  <p><code>Connection</code> objects must also implement the
  <code>EventTarget</code> interface. <a
  href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a>

  <p>When a <code>Connection</code> object is created, the UA must try
  to establish a connection, as described in the sections below
  describing each connection type.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-Connection-network"><code>network</code></dfn> attribute
  represents the name of the network connection (the value depends on
  the kind of connection being established). The <dfn
  title="dom-Connection-peer"><code>peer</code></dfn> attribute
  identifies the remote host for direct (non-broadcast)
  connections.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-Connection-network">network</code> attribute
  must be set as soon as the <code>Connection</code> object is
  created, and keeps the same value for the lifetime of the object.
  The <code title="dom-Connection-peer">peer</code> attribute must
  initially be set to the empty string and must be updated once, when
  the connection is established, after which point it must keep the
  same value for the lifetime of the object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-Connection-readyState"><code>readyState</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the state of the connection. When the object is
  created it must be set to 0. It can have the following values:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>0 Connecting</dt>
   <dd>The connection has not yet been established.</dd>

   <dt>1 Connected</dt>
   <dd>The connection is established and communication is possible.</dd>

   <dt>2 Closed</dt>
   <dd>The connection has been closed.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p id="openConnection">Once a connection is established, the <code
  title="dom-Connection-readyState">readyState</code> attribute's
  value must be changed to 1, and the <code
  title="event-connection-open">open</code> event must be fired on the
  <code>Connection</code> object.</p>

  <p>When data is received, the <code
  title="event-connection-read">read</code> event will be fired on the
  <code>Connection</code> object.</p> <!-- conf crit for this
  statement is in the various protocol-specific sections below. -->

  <p id="closeConnection">When the connection is closed, the <code
  title="dom-Connection-readyState">readyState</code> attribute's
  value must be changed to 2, and the <code
  title="event-connection-close">close</code> event must be fired on
  the <code>Connection</code> object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Connection-onopen"><code>onopen</code></dfn>,
  <dfn title="dom-Connection-onread"><code>onread</code></dfn>, and
  <dfn title="dom-Connection-onclose"><code>onclose</code></dfn>
  attributes must, when set, register their new value as an event
  listener for their respective events (namely <code
  title="event-connection-open">open</code>, <code
  title="event-connection-read">read</code>, and <code
  title="event-connection-close">close</code>), and unregister their
  previous value if any.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Connection-send"><code>send()</code></dfn>
  method transmits data using the connection. If the connection is not
  yet established, it must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>
  exception. If the connection <em>is</em> established, then the
  behaviour depends on the connection type, as described below.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-Connection-disconnect"><code>disconnect()</code></dfn>
  method must close the connection, if it is open. If the connection
  is already closed, it must do nothing. Closing the connection causes
  a <code title="event-connection-close">close</code> event to be
  fired and the <code
  title="dom-Connection-readyState">readyState</code> attribute's
  value to change, as <a href="#closeConnection">described
  above</a>.</p>


  <h4>Connection Events</h4>

  <p>All the events described in this section are events in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</code> namespace, which do
  not bubble, are not cancelable, and have no default action.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-connection-open"><code>open</code></dfn>
  event is fired when the connection is established. UAs must use the
  normal <code>Event</code> interface when firing this event.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-connection-close"><code>close</code></dfn>
  event is fired when the connection is closed (whether by the author,
  calling the <code
  title="dom-Connection-disconnect">disconnect()</code> method, or by
  the server, or by a network error). UAs must use the normal
  <code>Event</code> interface when firing this event as well.</p>

  <p class="note">No information regarding why the connection was
  closed is passed to the application in this version of this
  specification.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-connection-read"><code>read</code></dfn>
  event is fired when when data is received for a connection. UAs must
  use the <code>ConnectionReadEvent</code> interface for this
  event.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>ConnectionReadEvent</dfn> : Event {
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-data">data</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-source">source</span>;
  void <span title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-initConnectionReadEvent">initConnectionReadEvent</span>(in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMString dataArg);
  void <span title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-initConnectionReadEventNS">initConnectionReadEventNS</span>(in DOMString namespaceURI, in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMString dataArg);
};
</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-data"><code>data</code></dfn>
  attribute must contain the data that was transmitted from the
  peer.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-source"><code>source</code></dfn>
  attribute must contain the name of the peer. This is primarily
  useful on broadcast connections; on direct connections it is equal
  to the <code title="dom-Connection-peer">peer</code> attribute on
  the <code>Connection</code> object.</p>

  <!-- XXX check that the following three sections define "the data
  that was transmitted" and "the name of the peer" in terms that mean
  they fit into the above definitions ("for the purposes of the
  ConnectionReadEvent"). -->

  <!-- XXX should we have a Connection attribute on the event? -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-initConnectionReadEvent"><code>initConnectionReadEvent()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn
  title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-initConnectionReadEventNS"><code>initConnectionReadEventNS()</code></dfn>
  methods must initialise the event in a manner analogous to the
  similarly-named methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a
  href="#DOM3Events">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>Events that would be fired during script execution (e.g. between
  the connection object being created &mdash; and thus the connection
  being established &mdash; and the current script completing; or,
  during the execution of a <code
  title="event-connection-read">read</code> event handler) must be
  buffered, and those events queued up and each one individually fired
  after the script has completed.</p> <!-- XXX make this more generic -->

  <h4>TCP connections</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-TCPConnection"><code>TCPConnection(<var
  title="">subdomain</var>, <var title="">port</var>, <var
  title="">secure</var>)</code></dfn> constructor on the
  <code>Window</code> interface returns a new object implementing the
  <code>Connection</code> interface, set up for a direct connection to
  a specified host on the page's domain.</p>

  <p>When this constructor is invoked, the following steps must be
  followed.</p>

  <p>First, if the <span>script's domain</span> is not a host name
  (e.g. it is an IP address) then the UA must raise a <span>security
  exception</span>. <span class="issue">We currently don't allow
  connections to be set up back to an originating IP address, but we
  could, if the subdomain is the empty string.</span></p>

  <p>Then, if the <var title="">subdomain</var> argument is null or
  the empty string, the target host is the <span>script's
  domain</span>. Otherwise, the <var title="">subdomain</var> argument
  is prepended to the <span>script's domain</span> with a dot
  separating the two strings, and that is the target host.</p>

  <p>If the target host is not a valid host name, or if the <var
  title="">port</var> argument is not either equal to 80, 443, or
  greater than 1024 and less then 65537, then the UA must raise a
  <span>security exception</span>.</p> <!-- XXX we should have our own
  port for this too, e.g. 980 -->

  <p>Otherwise, the user agent must verify that the <span>the string
  representing the script's domain in IDNA format</span> can be
  obtained without errors. If it cannot, then the user agent must
  raise a <span>security exception</span>.</p>

  <p>The user agent may also raise a <span>security exception</span>
  at this time if, for some reason, permission to create a direct TCP
  connection to the relevant host is denied. Reasons could include the
  UA being instructed by the user to not allow direct connections, or
  the UA establishing (for instance using UPnP) that the network
  topology will cause connections on the specified port to be directed
  at the wrong host.</p>

  <p>If no exceptions are raised by the previous steps, then a new
  <code>Connection</code> object must be created, its <code
  title="dom-Connection-peer">peer</code> attribute must be set to a
  string consisting of the name of the target host, a colon (U+003A
  COLON), and the port number as decimal digits, and its <code
  title="dom-Connection-network">network</code> attribute must be set
  to the same value as the <code
  title="dom-Connection-peer">peer</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>This object must then be returned.</p>

  <p>The user agent must then begin trying to establish a connection
  with the target host and specified port. (This typically would begin
  in the backgound, while the script continues to execute.)</p>

  <p>If the <var title="">secure</var> boolean argument is set to
  true, then the user agent must establish a secure connection with
  the target host and specified port using TLS or another protocol,
  negotiated with the server. <a href="#refsRFC2246">[RFC2246]</a> If
  this fails the user agent must act as if it had <a
  href="#closeConnection">closed the connection</a>.</p>

  <p>Once a secure connection is established, or if the <var
  title="">secure</var> boolean argument is not set to true, then the
  user agent must continue to connect to the server using the protocol
  described in the section entitled <span>clients connecting over
  TCP</span>. All data on connections made using TLS must be sent as
  "application data".</p>

  <p>Once the connection is established, the UA must act as described
  in the section entitled <span>sending and receiving data over
  TCP</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow multiple TCP connections to be
  established per host. In particular, user agents should not apply
  per-host HTTP connection limits to connections established with the
  <code title="dom-TCPConnection">TCPConnection</code>
  constructor.</p>


  <h4>Broadcast connections</h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-LocalBroadcastConnection"><code>LocalBroadcastConnection()</code></dfn>
  constructor on the <code>Window</code> interface returns a new
  object implementing the <code>Connection</code> interface, set up to
  broadcast on the local network.</p>

  <p>When this constructor is invoked, a new <code>Connection</code>
  object must be created.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-Connection-network">network</code> attribute
  of the object must be set to <span>the string representing the
  script's domain in IDNA format</span>. If this string cannot be
  obtained, then the user agent must raise a <span>security
  exception</span> exception when the constructor is called.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-Connection-peer">peer</code> attribute must
  be set to the empty string.</p>

  <p>The object must then be returned, unless, for some reason,
  permission to broadcast on the local network is to be denied. In the
  latter case, a <span>security exception</span> must be raised
  instead. User agents may deny such permission for any reason, for
  example a user preference.</p>

  <p>If the object is returned (i.e. if no exception is raised), the
  user agent must the begin broadcasting and listening on the local
  network, in the background, as described below. The user agent may
  define "the local network" in any way it considers appropriate and
  safe; for instance the user agent may ask the user which network
  (e.g. Bluetooth, IrDA, Ethernet, etc) the user would like to
  broadcast on before beginning broadcasting.</p>

  <p>UAs may broadcast and listen on multiple networks at once. For
  example, the UA could broadcast on both Bluetooth and Wifi at the
  same time.</p> <!-- XXX bridging? how do we handle one UA not seeing
  the same hosts as another UA? -->

  <p>As soon as the object is returned, the connection <a
  href="#openConnection">has been established</a>, which implies that
  the <code title="event-connection-open">open</code> event must be
  fired. Broadcast connections are never closed.</p>


  <h5>Broadcasting over TCP/IP</h5>

  <p class="big-issue">We need to register a UDP port for this. For
  now this spec refers to port 18080/udp.</p>

  <p class="note">Since this feature requires that the user agent
  listen to a particular port, typically only one user agent per IP
  address can use this feature at any one time.</p>

  <p>On TCP/IP networks, broadcast connections transmit data using UDP
  over port 18080.</p>

  <p>When the <code title="dom-Connection-send">send(<var
  title="">data</var>)</code> method is invoked on a
  <code>Connection</code> object that was created by the <code
  title="dom-LocalBroadcastConnection">LocalBroadcastConnection()</code>
  constructor, the user agent must follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Create a string consisting of the value of the <code
   title="dom-Connection-network">network</code> attribute of the
   <code>Connection</code> object, a U+0020 SPACE character, a U+0002
   START OF TEXT character, and the <var title="">data</var>
   argument.</li>

   <li>Encode the string as UTF-8.</li>

   <li>If the resulting byte stream is longer than 65487 bytes, raise
   an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> DOM exception and stop.</li>

   <li>Create a UDP packet whose data is the byte stream, with the
   source and destination ports being 18080, and with appropriate
   length and checksum fields. Transmit this packet to IPv4 address
   255.255.255.255 or IPv6 address ff02::1, as appropriate. <span
   class="note">IPv6 applications will also have to enable reception
   from this address.</span></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When a broadcast connection is opened on a TCP/IP network, the
  user agent should listen for UDP packets on port 18080.</p>

  <p>When the user agent receives a packet on port 18080, the user
  agent must attempt to decode that packet's data as UTF-8. If the
  data is not fully correct UTF-8 (i.e. if there are decoding errors)
  then the packet must be ignored. Otherwise, the user agent must
  check to see if the decoded string contains a U+0020 SPACE
  character. If it does not, then the packet must again be ignored (it
  might be a peer discovery packet from a <code
  title="dom-PeerToPeerConnection">PeerToPeerConnection()</code>
  constructor). If it does then the user agent must split the
  string at the first space character. All the characters before the
  space are then known as <var title="">d</var>, and all the
  characters after the space are known as <var title="">s</var>. If
  <var title="">s</var> is not at least one character long, or if the
  first character of <var title="">s</var> is not a U+0002 START OF
  TEXT character, then the packet must be ignored. (This allows for
  future extension of this protocol.)</p>

  <p>Otherwise, for each <code>Connection</code> object that was
  created by the <code
  title="dom-LocalBroadcastConnection">LocalBroascastConnection()</code>
  constructor and whose <code
  title="dom-Connection-network">network</code> attribute exactly
  matches <var title="">d</var>, a <code
  title="event-connection-read">read</code> event must be fired on the
  <code>Connection</code> object. The string <var title="">s</var>,
  with the first character removed, must be used as the <code
  title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-data">data</code>, and the source IP
  address of the packet as the <code
  title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-source">source</code>.</p>

  <h4>Peer-to-peer connections</h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-PeerToPeerConnection"><code>PeerToPeerConnection()</code></dfn>
  constructor on the <code>Window</code> interface returns a new
  object implementing the <code>Connection</code> interface, set up
  for a direct connection to a user-specified host.</p>

  <p>When this constructor is invoked, a new <code>Connection</code>
  object must be created.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-Connection-network">network</code> attribute
  of the object must be set to <span>the string representing the
  script's domain in IDNA format</span>. If this string cannot be
  obtained, then the user agent must raise a <span>security
  exception</span> exception when the constructor is called.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-Connection-peer">peer</code> attribute must
  be set to the empty string.</p>

  <p>The object must then be returned, unless, for some reason,
  permission to establish peer-to-peer connections is generally
  disallowed, for example due to administrator settings. In the latter
  case, a <span>security exception</span> must be raised instead.</p>

  <p>The user agent must then, typically while the script resumes
  execution, find a remote host to establish a connection to. To do
  this it must start broadcasting and listening for peer discovery
  messages and listening for incoming connection requests on all the
  supported networks. How this is performed depends on the type of
  network and is described below.</p>

  <p>The UA should inform the user of the clients that are detected,
  and allow the user to select one to connect to. UAs may also allow
  users to explicit specify hosts that were not detected, e.g. by
  having the user enter an IP address.</p>

  <p>If an incoming connection is detected before the user specifies a
  target host, the user agent should ask the user to confirm that this
  is the host they wish to connect to. If it is, the connection should
  be accepted and the UA will act as the <em>server</em> in this
  connection. (Which UA acts as the server and which acts as the
  client is not discernible at the DOM API level.)</p>

  <p>If no incoming connection is detected and if the user specifies a
  particular target host, a connection should be established to that
  host, with the UA acting as the <em>client</em> in the
  connection.</p>

  <p>No more than one connection must be established per
  <code>Connection</code> object, so once a connection has been
  established, the user agent must stop listening for further
  connections (unless, or until such time as, another
  <code>Connection</code> object is being created).</p>

  <p>If at any point the user cancels the connection process or the
  remote host refuses the connection, then the user agent must act as
  if it had <a href="#closeConnection">closed the connection</a>, and
  stop trying to connect.</p>


  <h5>Peer-to-peer connections over TCP/IP</h5>

  <p class="big-issue">We need to register ports for this. For now
  this spec refers to port 18080/udp and 18080/tcp.</p>

  <p class="note">Since this feature requires that the user agent
  listen to a particular port, typically only one user agent per IP
  address can use this feature at any one time.</p>

  <p>When using TCP/IP, broadcasting peer discovery messages must be
  done by creating UDP packets every few seconds containing as their
  data the value of the connection's <code
  title="dom-Connection-network">network</code> attribute, encoded as
  UTF-8, with the source and destination ports being set to 18080 and
  appropriate length and checksum fields, and sending these packets to
  address (in IPv4) 255.255.255.255 or (in IPv6) ff02::1, as
  appropriate.</p>

  <p>Listening for peer discovery messages must be done by examining
  incoming UDP packets on port 18080. <span class="note">IPv6
  applications will also have to enable reception from the ff02::1
  address.</span> If their payload is exactly byte-for-byte equal to a
  UTF-8 encoded version of the value of the connection's <code
  title="dom-Connection-network">network</code> attribute, then the
  source address of that packet represents the address of a host that
  is ready to accept a peer-to-peer connection, and it should
  therefore be offered to the user.</p>

  <p>Incoming connection requests must be listened for on TCP port
  18080. If an incoming connection is received, the UA acts as a
  <em>server</em>, as described in the section entitled <span>servers
  accepting connections over TCP</span>.</p>

  <p>If no incoming connection requests are accepted and the user
  instead specifies a target host to connect to, the UA acts as a
  <em>client</em>: the user agent must attempt to connect to the
  user-specified host on port 18080, as described in the section
  entitled <span>clients connecting over TCP</span>.</p>

  <p>Once the connection is established, the UA must act as described
  in the section entitled <span>sending and receiving data over
  TCP</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">This specification does not include a way to
  establish <em>secure</em> (encrypted) peer-to-peer connections at
  this time. <span class="big-issue">If you can see a good way to do
  this, let me know.</span></p>

  <h4>The common protocol for TCP-based connections</h4>

  <p>The same protocol is used for <code
  title="dom-TCPConnection">TCPConnection</code> and <code
  title="dom-PeerToPeerConnection">PeerToPeerConnection</code>
  connection types. This section describes how such connections are
  established from the client and server sides, and then describes how
  data is sent and received over such connections (which is the same
  for both clients and servers).</p>


  <h5><dfn>Clients connecting over TCP</dfn></h5>

  <p>This section defines the client-side requirements of the protocol
  used by the <code title="dom-TCPConnection">TCPConnection</code> and
  <code title="dom-PeerToPeerConnection">PeerToPeerConnection</code>
  connection types.</p>

  <p>If a TCP connection to the specified target host and port cannot
  be established, for example because the target host is a domain name
  that cannot be resolved to an IP address, or because packets cannot
  be routed to the host, the user agent should retry creating the
  connection. If the user agent gives up trying to connect, the user
  agent must act as if it had <a href="#closeConnection">closed the
  connection</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">No information regarding the state of the connection
  is passed to the application while the connection is being
  established in this version of this specification.</p>

  <p>Once a TCP/IP connection to the remote host is established, the
  user agent must transmit the following sequence of bytes,
  represented here in hexadecimal form:</p>

  <pre>0x48 0x65 0x6C 0x6C 0x6F 0x0A</pre>

  <p class="note">This represents the string "Hello" followed by a
  newline, encoded in UTF-8.</p>

  <p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote
  host, up to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes is
  then compared byte-for-byte to the following string of bytes:</p>

  <pre>0x57 0x65 0x6C 0x63 0x6F 0x6E 0x65 0x0A</pre>

  <p class="note">This says "Welcome".</p>

  <p>If the server sent back a string in any way different to this,
  then the user agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the
  connection</a> and give up trying to connect.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the user agent must then take <span>the string
  representing the script's domain in IDNA format</span>, encode it as
  UTF-8, and send that to the remote host, followed by a 0x0A byte (a
  U+000A LINE FEED in UTF-8).</p>

  <p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote
  host, up to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes
  must then be compared byte-for-byte to the string that was just sent
  to the server (the one with the IDNA domain name and ending with a
  newline character). If the server sent back a string in any way
  different to this, then the user agent must <a
  href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and give up trying
  to connect.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the connection <a href="#openConnection">has been
  established</a> (and events and so forth get fired, as described
  above).</p>

  <p>If at any point during this process the connection is closed
  prematurely, then the user agent must <a
  href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and give up trying
  to connect.</p> <!-- XXX we should support automatic reconnect -->


  <h5><dfn>Servers accepting connections over TCP</dfn></h5>

  <p>This section defines the server side of the protocol described in
  the previous section. For authors, it should be used as a guide for
  how to implement servers that can communicate with Web pages over
  TCP. For UAs these are the requirements for the server part of <code
  title="dom-PeerToPeerConnection">PeerToPeerConnection</code>s.</p>

  <p>Once a TCP/IP connection from a remote host is established, the
  user agent must transmit the following sequence of bytes,
  represented here in hexadecimal form:</p>

  <pre>0x57 0x65 0x6C 0x63 0x6F 0x6E 0x65 0x0A</pre>

  <p class="note">This says "Welcome" and a newline in UTF-8.</p>

  <p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote
  host, up to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes is
  then compared byte-for-byte to the following string of bytes:</p>

  <pre>0x48 0x65 0x6C 0x6C 0x6F 0x0A</pre>

  <p class="note">"Hello" and a newline.</p>

  <p>If the remote host sent back a string in any way different to
  this, then the user agent must <a href="#closeConnection">close the
  connection</a> and give up trying to connect.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the user agent must then take <span>the string
  representing the script's domain in IDNA format</span>, encode it as
  UTF-8, and send that to the remote host, followed by a 0x0A byte (a
  U+000A LINE FEED in UTF-8).</p>

  <p>The user agent must then read all the bytes sent from the remote
  host, up to the first 0x0A byte (inclusive). That string of bytes
  must then be compared byte-for-byte to the string that was just sent
  to that host (the one with the IDNA domain name and ending with a
  newline character). If the remote host sent back a string in any way
  different to this, then the user agent must <a
  href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and give up trying
  to connect.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the connection <a href="#openConnection">has been
  established</a> (and events and so forth get fired, as described
  above).</p>

  <p class="note">For author-written servers (as opposed to the server
  side of a peer-to-peer connection), the script's domain would be
  replaced by the hostname of the server. Alternatively, such servers
  might instead wait for the client to send its domain string, and
  then simply echo it back. This would allow connections from pages on
  any domain, instead of just pages originating from the same
  host. The client compares the two strings to ensure they are the
  same before allowing the connection to be used by author script.</p>

  <p>If at any point during this process the connection is closed
  prematurely, then the user agent must <a
  href="#closeConnection">close the connection</a> and give up trying
  to connect.</p> <!-- XXX we should support automatic reconnect -->


  <h5><dfn>Sending and receiving data over TCP</dfn></h5>

  <p>When the <code title="dom-Connection-send">send(<var
  title="">data</var>)</code> method is invoked on the connection's
  corresponding <code>Connection</code> object, the user agent must
  take the <var title="">data</var> argument, replace any U+0000 NULL
  and U+0017 END OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK characters in it with U+FFFD
  REPLACEMENT CHARACTER characters, then transmit a U+0002 START OF
  TEXT character, this new <var title="">data</var> string and a
  single U+0017 END OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK character (in that order) to
  the remote host, all encoded as UTF-8.</p>

  <p>When the user agent receives bytes on the connection, the user
  agent must buffer received bytes until it receives a 0x17 byte (a
  U+0017 END OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK character). If the first buffered
  byte is not a 0x02 byte (a U+0002 START OF TEXT character encoded as
  UTF-8) then all the data up to the 0x17 byte, inclusive, must be
  dropped. (This allows for future extension of this protocol.)
  Otherwise, all the data from (but not including) the 0x02 byte and
  up to (but not including) the 0x17 byte must be taken, interpreted
  as a UTF-8 string, and a <code
  title="event-connection-read">read</code> event must be fired on the
  <code>Connection</code> object with that string as the <code
  title="dom-ConnectionReadEvent-data">data</code>. If that string
  cannot be decoded as UTF-8 without errors, the packet should be
  ignored.</p>

  <p class="note">This protocol does not yet allow binary data
  (e.g. an image or video data) to be efficiently transmitted. A
  future version of this protocol might allow this by using the prefix
  character U+001F INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE, followed by binary data
  which uses a particular byte (e.g. 0xFF) to encode byte 0x17 somehow
  (since otherwise 0x17 would be treated as transmission end by
  down-level UAs).</p>

  <!--
    Specifically, replace all occurrences of 0xFF with 0xFF 0xFF and
    all occurrences of 0x17 with 0xFF 0x00, or similar.
   -->

  <h4>Security</h4>

  <p class="big-issue">Need to write this section.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">If you have an unencrypted page that is
  (through a man-in-the-middle attack) changed, it can access a secure
  service that is using IP authentication and then send that data back
  to the attacker. Ergo we should probably stop unencrypted pages from
  accessing encrypted services, on the principle that the actual level
  of security is zero. Then again, if we do that, we prevent insecure
  sites from using SSL as a tunneling mechanism.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">Should consider dropping the subdomain-only
  restriction. It doesn't seem to add anything, and prevents
  cross-domain chatter.</p>

  <h4>Relationship to other standards</h4>

  <p class="big-issue">Should have a section talking about the fact
  that we blithely ignoring IANA's port assignments here.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">Should explain why we are not reusing HTTP for
  this. (HTTP is too heavy-weight for such a simple need; requiring
  authors to implement an HTTP server just to have a party line is too
  much of a barrier to entry; cannot rely on prebuilt components;
  having a simple protocol makes it much easier to do RAD; HTTP
  doesn't fit the needs and doesn't have the security model
  needed; etc)</p>



  <h3 id="crossDocumentMessages"><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Cross-document messaging</h3>

  <p>Web browsers, for security and privacy reasons, prevent documents
  in different domains from affecting each other; that is, cross-site
  scripting is disallowed.</p>

  <p>While this is an important security feature, it prevents pages
  from different domains from communicating even when those pages are
  not hostile. This section introduces a messaging system that allows
  documents to communicate with each other regardless of their source
  domain, in a way designed to not enable cross-site scripting
  attacks.</p>

  <h4>Definitions</h4>

  <p>Any <code>Document</code> object that supports this
  cross-document messaging API must implement the
  <code>DocumentMessaging</code> interface.</p>

  <!-- XXX this method name is too generic -->
  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>DocumentMessaging</dfn> {
  void <span>postMessage</span>(in DOMString message);
};</pre>

  <p>Such <code>Document</code> objects must also implement the
  <code>EventTarget</code> interface. <a
  href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>The <span>postMessage()</span> method causes an event to be
  dispatched (as defined below). This event uses the following
  interface:</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>CrossDocumentMessageEvent</dfn> : Event {
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-data">data</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-domain">domain</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-uri">uri</span>;
  readonly attribute Document <span title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-source">source</span>;
  void <span title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-initCrossDocumentMessageEvent">initCrossDocumentMessageEvent</span>(in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMString dataArg, in DOMString domainArg, in DOMString uriArg, in Document documentArg);
  void <span title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-initCrossDocumentMessageEventNS">initCrossDocumentMessageEventNS</span>(in DOMString namespaceURI, in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in DOMString dataArg, in DOMString domainArg, in DOMString uriArg, in Document documentArg);
};</pre>

  <p class="big-issue">Define those members</p>


  <h4>Processing model</h4>

  <p>When a script invokes the <dfn><code>postMessage()</code></dfn>
  method on a document, the user agent must create an event that uses
  the <code>CrossDocumentMessageEvent</code> interface, with the event
  name <dfn title="message-event"><code>message</code></dfn> in the
  <code>uuid:7f37e11a-3a5c-4f3d-a82e-83b611439f37</code> namespace,
  which bubbles, is cancelable, and has no default action. The <dfn
  title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-data"><code>data</code></dfn>
  attribute must be set to the value passed as the argument to the
  <code>postMessage()</code> method, the <dfn
  title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-domain"><code>domain</code></dfn>
  attribute must be set to the domain of the document that the script
  that invoked the methods is associated with, the <dfn
  title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-uri"><code>uri</code></dfn>
  attribute must be set to the URI of that document, and the <dfn
  title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-source"><code>source</code></dfn>
  attribute must be set to the object representing that document.</p>

  <p class="warning">Authors should check the <code
  title="dom-CrossDocumentMessageEvent-domain">domain</code> attribute to
  ensure that messages are only accepted from domains that they expect
  to receive messages from. Otherwise, bugs in the author's message
  handling code could be exploited by hostile sites.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, if document A contains an <code>object</code>
   element that contains document B, and script in document A calls
   <code>postMessage()</code> on document B, then a message event will
   be fired on that element, marked as originating from document A.
   The script in document A might look like:</p>

   <pre>var o = document.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
o.<span>contentDocument</span>.<span>postMessage</span>('Hello world');
</pre>

   <p>To register an event handler for incoming events, the script
   would use <code>addEventListener()</code> (or similar mechanisms).
   For example, the script in document B might look like:</p>

   <pre>document.addEventListener('message', receiver, false);
function receiver(e) {
  if (e.domain == 'example.com') {
    if (e.data == 'Hello world') {
      e.source.postMessage('Hello');
    } else {
      alert(e.data);
    }
  }
}</pre>

   <p>This script first checks the domain is the expected domain, and
   then looks at the message, which it either displays to the user, or
   responds to by sending a message back to the document which sent
   the message in the first place.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="note">Implementors are urged to take extra care in the
  implementation of this feature. It allows authors to transmit
  information from one domain to another domain, which is normally
  disallowed for security reasons. It also requires that UAs be
  careful to allow access to certain properties but not others.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>initCrossDocumentMessageEvent()</code></dfn> and
  <dfn><code>initCrossDocumentMessageEventNS()</code></dfn> methods
  must initialise an event object in a manner analogous to other
  <code>initXXXEvent</code> metheds.</p>

   documents; the only user agents to strictly handle HTML as an SGML
   application have historically been validators. The resulting
   confusion &mdash; with validators claiming documents to have one
   representation while widely deployed Web browsers interoperably
   implemented a different representation &mdash; has resulted in this
   version of HTML returning to a non-SGML basis.</p>

   <p>Authors interested in using SGML tools in their authoring
   pipeline are encouraged to use the XML serialisation of HTML5
   instead of the HTML serialisation.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This specification defines the parsing rules for HTML documents,
  whether they are syntactically valid or not. Certain points in the
  parsing algorithm are said to be <dfn title="parse error">parse
  errors</dfn>. The error handling for parse errors is well-defined:
  user agents must either act as described below when encountering
  such problems, or must abort processing at the first error that they
  encounter for which they do not wish to apply the rules described
  below.</p>

  <p>Conformance checkers must report at least one parse error
  condition to the user if one or more parse error conditions exist in
  the document and must not report parse error conditions if none
  exist in the document. Conformance checkers may report more than one
  parse error condition if more than one parse error conditions exist
  in the document. Conformance checkers are not required to recover
  from parse errors.</p>

  <p class="note">Parse errors are only errors with the
  <em>syntax</em> of HTML. In addition to checking for parse errors,
  conformance checkers will also verify that the document obeys all
  the other conformance requirements described in this
  specification.</p>


  <h4>Overview of the parsing model</h4>

  <p>The input to the HTML parsing process consists of a stream of
  Unicode characters, which is passed through a
  <span>tokenisation</span> stage (lexical analysis) followed by a
  <span>tree construction</span> stage (semantic analysis). The output
  is a <code>Document</code> object.</p>

  <p class="note">Implementations that <a href="#non-scripted">do not
  support scripting</a> do not have to actually create a DOM
  <code>Document</code> object, but the DOM tree in such cases is
  still used as the model for the rest of the specification.</p>

  <p>In the common case, the data handled by the tokenisation stage
  comes from the network, but <span title="dynamic markup
  insertion">it can also come from script</span>, e.g. using the <code
  title="dom-document-write-HTML">document.write()</code> API.</p>

  <p><img src="parsing-model-overview.png" alt=""></p>

  <p id="nestedParsing">There is only one set of state for the
  tokeniser stage and the tree construction stage, but the tree
  construction stage is reentrant, meaning that while the tree
  construction stage is handling one token, the tokeniser might be
  resumed, causing further tokens to be emitted and processed before
  the first token's processing is complete.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the tree construction stage will be
   called upon to handle a "p" start tag token while handling the
   "script" start tag token:</p>

   <pre>...
&lt;script>
 document.write('&lt;p>');
&lt;/script>
...</pre>

  </div>


  <h4>The <dfn>input stream</dfn></h4>

  <p>The stream of Unicode characters that consists the input to the
  tokenisation stage will be initially seen by the user agent as a
  stream of bytes (typically coming over the network or from the local
  file system). The bytes encode the actual characters according to a
  particular <em>character encoding</em>, which the user agent must
  use to decode the bytes into characters.</p>

  <p id="documentEncoding">For HTML, user agents must use the
  following algorithm in determining the character encoding of a
  document:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the transport layer specifies an encoding, use that.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the user agent can find a <code>meta</code>
   element that <a href="#charset">specifies character encoding
   information</a>, then use that. (The exact parsing rules for
   finding and using this information are not yet described in this
   specification.) <span class="big-issue">This needs to be fleshed
   out a whole heck of a lot more.</span></li> <!-- XXX -->

   <li>Otherwise, the user agent may attempt to autodetect the
   character encoding from applying frequency analysis or other
   algorithms to the data stream. If autodetection succeeds in
   determining a character encoding, then use that.</li> <!-- is it a
   parse error to reach this step? XXX -->

   <li>Otherwise, use an implementation-defined or user-specified
   default character encoding (<code>ISO-8859-1</code>,
   <code>windows-1252</code>, and <code>UTF-8</code> are recommended
   as defaults, and can in many cases be identified by inspection as
   they have different ranges of valid bytes).</li> <!-- only default
   to win1252? XXX -->

  </ol>

  <p class="note">For XML documents, the algorithm user agents must
  use to determine the character encoding is given by the XML
  specification. This section does not apply to XML documents. <a
  href="#refsXML">[XML]</a></p>

  <p>Bytes or sequences of bytes in the original byte stream that
  could not be converted to Unicode characters must be converted to
  U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER code points.</p>

  <p>A leading U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) must be dropped if
  present.</p>

  <p>All U+0000 NULL characters in the input must be replaced by
  U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs.</p>

  <p>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters, and U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
  characters, are treated specially. Any CR characters that are
  followed by LF characters must be removed, and any CR characters not
  followed by LF characters must be converted to LF characters. Thus,
  newlines in HTML DOMs are represented by LF characters, and there
  are never any CR characters in the input to the
  <span>tokenisation</span> stage.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>next input character</dfn> is the first character in the
  input stream that has not yet been <dfn>consumed</dfn>. Initially,
  the <em>next input character</em> is the first character in the
  input.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>insertion point</dfn> is the position (just before a
  character or just before the end of the input stream) where content
  inserted using <code
  title="dom-document-write-HTML">document.write()</code> is actually
  inserted. The insertion point is relative to the position of the
  character immediately after it, it is not an absolute offset into
  the input stream. Initially, the insertion point is
  uninitialised.</p>

  <p>The "EOF" character in the tables below is a conceptual character
  representing the end of the <span>input stream</span>. If the parser
  is a <span>script-created parser</span>, then the end of the
  <span>input stream</span> is reached when an <dfn>explicit "EOF"
  character</dfn> (inserted by the <code
  title="dom-document-close">document.close()</code> method) is
  consumed. Otherwise, the "EOF" charecter is not a real character in
  the stream, but rather the lack of any further characters.</p>


  <h4><dfn>Tokenisation</dfn></h4>

  <p>Implementations must act as if they used the following state
  machine to tokenise HTML. The state machine must start in the
  <span>data state</span>. Most states consume a single character,
  which may have various side-effects, and either switches the state
  machine to a new state to <em>reconsume</em> the same character, or
  switches it to a new state (to consume the next character), or
  repeats the same state (to consume the next character). Some states
  have more complicated behaviour and can consume several characters
  before switching to another state.</p>

  <p>The exact behaviour of certain states depends on a <dfn>content
  model flag</dfn> that is set after certain tokens are emitted. The
  flag has several states: <em title="">PCDATA</em>, <em
  title="">RCDATA</em>, <em title="">CDATA</em>, and <em
  title="">PLAINTEXT</em>. Initially it is in the PCDATA state.</p>

  <p>The output of the tokenisation step is a series of zero or more
  of the following tokens: DOCTYPE, start tag, end tag, comment,
  character, end-of-file. DOCTYPE tokens have names and can be either
  correct or in error.  Start and end tag tokens have a tagname and a
  list of attributes, each of which has a name and a value. Comment
  and character tokens have data.</p>

  <p>When a token is emitted, it must immediately be handled by the
  <span>tree construction</span> stage. The tree construction stage
  can affect the state of the <span>content model flag</span>, and can
  insert additional characters into the stream. (For example, the
  <code>script</code> element can result in scripts executing and
  using the <span>dynamic markup insertion</span> APIs to insert
  characters into the stream being tokenised.)</p>

  <p>Before each step of the tokeniser, the user agent must check to
  see if any scripts are ready. <span class="big-issue">...</span></p>

  <h5>Tokenising entities</h5>

  <p>This section defines how to <dfn>consume an entity</dfn>. This
  definition is used when parsing entities <span title="entity data
  state">in text</span> and <span title="entity in attribute value
  state">in attributes</span>.</p>

  <p>The behaviour depends on the identity of the next character (the
  one immediately after the U+0026 AMPERSAND character):</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (#)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Consume the U+0023 NUMBER SIGN.</p>

    <p>The behaviour further depends on the character after the U+0023
    NUMBER SIGN:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

     <dt>U+0078 LATIN SMALL LETTER X</dt>
     <dt>U+0058 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X</dt>

     <dd>

      <p>Consume the X.</p>

      <p>Follow the steps below, but using the range of characters
      U+0030 DIGIT ZERO through to U+0039 DIGIT NINE, U+0061 LATIN
      SMALL LETTER A through to U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z, and
      U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, through to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL
      LETTER Z (in other words, 0-9, A-Z, a-z).</p>

      <p>When it comes to interpreting the number, interpret it as a
      hexadecimal number.</p>

     </dd>


     <dt>Anything else</dt>

     <dd>

      <p>Follow the steps below, but using the range of characters
      U+0030 DIGIT ZERO through to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (i.e. just
      0-9).</p>

      <p>When it comes to interpreting the number, interpret it as a
      decimal number.</p>

     </dd>

    </dl>

    <p>Consume as many characters as match the range of characters
    given above.</p>

    <p>If no characters match the range, then don't consume any
    characters (and unconsume the U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character and, if
    appropriate, the X character). This is a <span>parse
    error</span>; nothing is returned.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if the next character is a U+003B SEMICOLON, consume
    that too. If it isn't, there is a <span>parse
    error</span>.</p>

    <p>If one or more characters match the range, then take them all
    and interpret the string of characters as a number (either
    hexadecimal or decimal as appropriate), and return a character
    token for the Unicode character whose codepoint is that number. If
    the number is not a valid Unicode character (e.g. if the number is
    higher than 1114111), or if the number is zero, then return a
    character token for the U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER character
    instead.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Anything else</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Consume the maximum number of characters possible, with the
    consumed characters case-sensitively matching one of the
    identifiers in the first column of the <span>entities</span>
    table.</p>

    <p>If no match can be made, then this is a <span>parse
    error</span>. No characters are consumed, and nothing is
    returned.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if the next character is a U+003B SEMICOLON, consume
    that too. If it isn't, there is a <span>parse
    error</span>.</p>

    <p>Return a character token for the character corresponding to the
    entity name (as given by the second column of the
    <span>entities</span> table).</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>If the markup contains <code>I'm &amp;notit without
     you</code>, the entity is parsed as "not", as in, <code>I'm
     &not;it without you</code>. But if the markup was <code>I'm
     &amp;notin without you</code>, the entity would be parsed as
     "notin", resulting in <code>I'm &notin; without you</code>.</p>

    </div>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="big-issue">This isn't quite right. For some entities, UAs
  require a semicolon, for others they don't. We probably need to do
  the same for backwards compatibility. If we do that we might be able
  to add more entities, e.g. for mathematics. Probably the way to mark
  whether or not an entity requires a semicolon is with an additional
  column in the <span title="entities">entity table lower
  down</span>.</p>


  <h4><dfn>Tree construction</dfn></h4>

  <p>The input to the tree construction stage is a sequence of tokens
  from the <span>tokenisation</span> stage. The tree construction
  stage is associated with a DOM <code>Document</code> object when a
  parser is created. The "output" of this stage consists of
  dynamically modifying or extending that document's DOM tree.</p>

  <p>Tree construction passes through several phases. Initially, UAs
  must act according to the steps described as being those of
  <span>the initial phase</span>.</p>

  <p>This specification does not define when an interactive user agent
  has to render the <code>Document</code> available to the user, or
  when it has to begin accepting user input.</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>append a
  character</dfn> to a node, the UA must collect it and all subsequent
  consecutive characters that would be appended to that node, and
  insert one <code>Text</code> node whose data is the concatenation of
  all those characters.</p>

  <p id="mutation-during-parsing">DOM mutation events must not fire
  for changes caused by the UA parsing the document. (Conceptually,
  the parser is not mutating the DOM, it is constructing it.) This
  includes the parsing of any content inserted using <code
  title="dom-document-write-HTML">document.write()</code> and <code
  title="dom-document-writeln">document.writeln()</code> calls.<!--
  XXX xref --> <a href="#refsDOM3Events">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p><!-- XXX
  what abotu innerHTML? -->

  <p class="note">Not all of the tag names mentioned below are
  conformant tag names in this specification; many are included to
  handle legacy content. They still form part of the algorithm that
  implementations are required to implement to claim conformance.</p>

  <p class="note">The algorithm described below places no limit on the
  depth of the DOM tree generated, or on the length of tag names,
  attribute names, attribute values, text nodes, etc. While
  implementators are encouraged to avoid arbitrary limits, it is
  recognised that <a href="#hardwareLimitations">practical
  concerns</a> will likely force user agents to impose nesting
  depths.</p>


  <h5><dfn>The initial phase</dfn></h5>

  <p>Initially, the tree construction stage must handle each token
  emitted from the <span>tokenisation</span> stage as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>A DOCTYPE token that is marked as being in error</dt>
   <dt>A comment token</dt>
   <dt>A start tag token</dt>
   <dt>An end tag token</dt>
   <dt>A character token that is not one of one of U+0009 CHARACTER
   TABULATION, U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000B LINE TABULATION, U+000C
   FORM FEED (FF), or U+0020 SPACE</dt>
   <dt>An end-of-file token</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>This specification does not define how to handle this case. In
    particular, user agents may ignore the entirety of this
    specification altogether for such documents, and instead invoke
    special parse modes with a greater emphasis on backwards
    compatibility.</p>

    <div class="note">
     <p>Browsers in particular have generally used DOCTYPE-based
     sniffing to invoke an "alternative conformance mode" known as
     <em>quirks mode</em> on certain documents. In this mode, emphasis
     is put on legacy compatibility rather than on standards
     compliance. This specification takes no position on this
     behaviour; documents without DOCTYPEs or with DOCTYPEs that do
     not conform to the syntax allowed by this specification are

    </div>

    <div class="big-issue">

     <p>As far as parsing goes, the quirks I know of are:</p>

     <ul>

      <li>Comment parsing is different.</li>

      <li>The following is considered one script block (!):
       <pre>&lt;script>&lt;!-- document.write('&lt;/script>'); -->&lt;/script></pre>
      </li>

      <li><code>&lt;/br></code> and <code>&lt;/p></code> do magical

      <li><code>p</code> can contain <code>table</code></li>

      <li>Safari and IE have special parsing rules for &lt;% ... %&gt;

     <p>Maybe we should just adopt all those and be done with it. One
     parsing mode to rule them all. Or legitimise/codify the quirks

  <h5><dfn>The main phase</dfn></h5>

  <p>After <span>the root element phase</span>, each token emitted
  from the <span>tokenisation</span> stage must be processed as
  described in <em>this</em> section. This is by far the most involved
  part of parsing an HTML document.</p>

  <p>The tree construction stage in this phase has several pieces of
  state: a <span>stack of open elements</span>, a <span>list of active
  formatting elements</span>, a <span><code title="">head</code>
  element pointer</span>, a <span><code title="">form</code> element
  pointer</span>, and an <span>insertion mode</span>.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">We could just fold insertion modes and phases
  into one concept (and duplicate the two rules common to all
  insertion modes into all of them).</p>


  <h6>The stack of open elements</h6>

  <p>Initially the <dfn>stack of open elements</dfn> contains just the
  <code>html</code> root element node created in the <span title="the
  root element phase">last phase</span> before switching to
  <em>this</em> phase (or, in the <span><code>innerHTML</code>
  case</span>, the <code>html</code> element created to represent the
  element whose <code title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code>
  attribute is being set). That's the topmost node of the stack. It
  never gets popped off the stack. (This stack grows downwards.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn>current node</dfn> is the bottommost node in this
  stack.</p>

  <p>Elements in the stack fall into the following categories:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn>Special</dfn></dt>
   <dd><p>The following HTML elements have varying levels of special
   parsing rules: <code>address</code>, <code>area</code>,
   <code>base</code>, <code>basefont</code>, <code>bgsound</code>,
   <code>blockquote</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>br</code>,
   <code>center</code>, <code>col</code>, <code>colgroup</code>,
   <code>dd</code>, <code>dir</code>, <code>div</code>,
   <code>dl</code>, <code>dt</code>, <code>embed</code>,
   <code>fieldset</code>, <code>form</code>, <code>frame</code>,
   <code>frameset</code>, <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>,
   <code>h3</code>, <code>h4</code>, <code>h5</code>, <code>h6</code>,
   <code>head</code>, <code>hr</code>, <code>iframe</code>,
   <code>image</code><!-- XXX ? this isn't an element that can end up
   on the stack-->, <code>img</code>, <code>input</code>,
   <code>isindex</code>, <code>li</code>, <code>link</code>,
   <code>listing</code>, <code>menu</code>, <code>meta</code>,
   <code>noembed</code>, <code>noframes</code>, <code>noscript</code>,
   <code>ol</code>, <code>optgroup</code>, <code>option</code>,
   <code>p</code>, <code>param</code>, <code>plaintext</code>,
   <code>pre</code>, <code>script</code>, <code>select</code>,
   <code>spacer</code>, <code>style</code>, <code>tbody</code>,
   <code>textarea</code>, <code>tfoot</code>, <code>thead</code>,
   <code>title</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>ul</code>, and
   <code>wbr</code>.</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn>Scoping</dfn></dt>
   <dd><p>The following HTML elements introduce new <span title="has
   an element in scope">scopes</span> for various parts of the
   parsing: <code>button</code>, <code>caption</code>,
   <code>html</code>, <code>marquee</code>, <code>object</code>,
   <code>table</code>, <code>td</code> and <code>th</code>.</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn>Formatting</dfn></dt>
   <dd><p>The following HTML elements are those that end up in the
   <span>list of active formatting elements</span>: <code>a</code>,
   <code>b</code>, <code>big</code>, <code>em</code>,
   <code>font</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>nobr</code>,
   <code>s</code>, <code>small</code>, <code>strike</code>,
   <code>strong</code>, <code>tt</code>, and <code>u</code>.</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn>Phrasing</dfn></dt>
   <dd><p>All other elements found while parsing an HTML
   document.</p></dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="big-issue">Still need to add these new elements to the
  lists: <code>event-source</code>, <code>section</code>,
  <code>nav</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>aside</code>,
  <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>datagrid</code>,
  <code>command</code></p>

  <p>The <span>stack of open elements</span> is said to <dfn
  title="has an element in scope">have an element in scope</dfn> or
  <dfn title="has an element in table scope">have an element in
  <em>table scope</em></dfn> when the following algorithm terminates
  in a match state:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Initialise <var title="">node</var> to be the <span>current
   node</span> (the bottommost node of the stack).</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">node</var> is the target node, terminate in a match
   state.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if <var title="">node</var> is a <code>table</code>
   element, terminate in a failure state.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the algorithm is the "has an element in scope"
   variant (rather than the "has an element in table scope" variant),
   and <var title="">node</var> is one of the following, terminate in a failure
   state:</p>
    <ul class="brief">
     <li><code>caption</code></li>
     <li><code>td</code></li>
     <li><code>th</code></li>
     <li><code>button</code></li>
     <li><code>marquee</code></li>
     <li><code>object</code></li>
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if <var title="">node</var> is an <code>html</code>
   element, terminate in a failure state. (This can only happen if the
   <var title="">node</var> is the topmost node of the <span>stack of open
   elements</span>, and prevents the next step from being invoked if
   there are no more elements in the stack.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, set <var title="">node</var> to the previous entry in the
   <span>stack of open elements</span> and return to step 2. (This
   will never fail, since the loop will always terminate in the
   previous step if the top of the stack is reached.)</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>Nothing happens if at any time any of the elements in the
  <span>stack of open elements</span> are moved to a new location in,
  or removed from, the <code>Document</code> tree. In particular, the
  stack is not changed in this situation. This can cause, amongst
  other strange effects, content to be appended to nodes that are no
  longer in the DOM.</p>

  <p class="note">In some cases (namely, when <a
  href="#adoptionAgency">closing misnested formatting elements</a>),
  the stack is manipulated in a random-access fashion.</p>


  <h6>The list of active formatting elements</h6>

  <p>Initially the <dfn>list of active formatting elements</dfn> is
  empty. It is used to handle mis-nested <span
  title="formatting">formatting element tags</span>.</p>

  <p>The list contains elements in the <span>formatting</span>
  category, and scope markers. The scope markers are inserted when
  entering buttons, <code>object</code> elements, marquees, table
  cells, and table captions, and are used to prevent formatting from
  "leaking" into tables, buttons, <code>object</code> elements, and
  marquees.</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>reconstruct the
  active formatting elements</dfn>, the UA must perform the following
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the last (most recently added) entry in the <span>list of
   active formatting elements</span> is a marker, or if it is an
   element that is in the <span>stack of open elements</span>, then
   there is nothing to reconstruct; stop this algorithm.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">entry</var> be the last (most recently added) element
   in the <span>list of active formatting elements</span>.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">entry</var> be the entry one earlier than
   <var title="">entry</var> in the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span>.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">entry</var> is neither a marker nor an element that is
   also in the <span>stack of open elements</span>, go to step 3.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">entry</var> be the element one later than
   <var title="">entry</var> in the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span>.</li>

   <li>Perform a shallow clone of the element <var title="">entry</var> to
   obtain <var title="">clone</var>. <a
   href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></li>

   <li>Append <var title="">clone</var> to the <span>current node</span> and
   push it onto the <span>stack of open elements</span> so that it is
   the new <span>current node</span>.</li>

   <li>Replace the entry for <var title="">entry</var> in the list with an
   entry for <var title="">clone</var>.</li>

   <li>If the entry for <var title="">clone</var> in the <span>list of active
   formatting elements</span> is not the last entry in the list,
   return to step 5.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>This has the effect of reopening all the formatting elements that
  were opened in the current body, cell, or caption (whichever is
  youngest) that haven't been explicitly closed.</p>

  <p class="note">The way this specification is written, the
  <span>list of active formatting elements</span> always consists of
  elements in chronological order with the least recently added
  element first and the most recently added element last (except for
  while steps 5 to 9 of the above algorithm are being executed, of
  course).</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>clear the list of
  active formatting elements up to the last marker</dfn>, the UA must
  perform the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Let <var title="">entry</var> be the last (most recently added) entry in
   the <span>list of active formatting elements</span>.</li>

   <li>Remove <var title="">entry</var> from the <span>list of active
   formatting elements</span>.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">entry</var> was a marker, then stop the algorithm at
   this point. The list has been cleared up to the last marker.</li>

   <li>Go to step 1.</li>

  </ol>


  <h6>Creating and inserting HTML elements</h6>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn title="create an
  element for the token">create an element for a token</dfn>, the UA
  must create a node implementing the interface appropriate for the
  element type corresponding to the tag name of the token (as given in
  the section of this specification that defines that element,
  e.g. for an <code>a</code> element it would be the
  <code>HTMLAnchorElement</code> interface), with the tag name being
  the name of that element, with the node being in the <span>HTML
  namespace</span>, and with the attributes on the node being those
  given in the given token.</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>insert an HTML
  element</dfn> for a token, the UA must first <span>create an element
  for the token</span>, and then append this node to the <span>current
  node</span>, and push it onto the <span>stack of open
  elements</span> so that it is the new <span>current node</span>.</p>

  <p>The steps below may also require that the UA insert an HTML
  element in a particular place, in which case the UA must
  <span>create an element for the token</span> and then insert or
  append the new node in the location specified. (This happens in
  particular during the parsing of tables with invalid content.)</p>

  <p>The interface appropriate for an element that is not defined in
  this specification is <code>HTMLElement</code>.</p>


  <h6>Closing elements that have implied end tags</h6>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>generate implied end
  tags</dfn>, then, if the <span>current node</span> is a
  <code>dd</code> element, a <code>dt</code> element, an
  <code>li</code> element, a <code>p</code> element, a <code>td</code>
  element, a <code>th</code> element, or a <code>tr</code> element,
  the UA must act as if an end tag with the respective tag name had
  been seen and then <span>generate implied end tags</span> again.</p>

  <p>The step that requires the UA to generate implied end tags but
  lists an element to exclude from the process, then the UA must
  perform the above steps as if that element was not in the above
  list.</p>


  <h6>The element pointers</h6>

  <p>Initially the <dfn><code title="">head</code> element
  pointer</dfn> and the <dfn><code title="">form</code> element
  pointer</dfn> are both null.</p>

  <p>Once a <code>head</code> element has been parsed (whether
  implicitly or explicitly) the <span><code title="">head</code>
  element pointer</span> gets set to point to this node.</p>

  <p>The <span><code title="">form</code> element pointer</span>
  points to the last <code>form</code> element that was opened and
  whose end tag has not yet been seen. It is used to make form
  controls associate with forms in the face of dramatically bad
  markup, for historical reasons.</p>


  <h6>The insertion mode</h6>

  <p>Initially the <dfn>insertion mode</dfn> is "<span
  title="insertion mode: before head">before head</span>". It can
  change to "<span title="insertion mode: in head">in head</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: after head">after head</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in body">in body</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in table">in table</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in caption">in caption</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in column group">in column group</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: in table body">in table body</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: in row">in row</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in cell">in cell</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in select">in select</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: after body">after body</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in frameset">in frameset</span>", and "<span
  title="insertion mode: after frameset">after frameset</span>" during
  the course of the parsing, as described below. It affects how
  certain tokens are processed.</p>

  <p>If the tree construction stage is switched from <span>the main
  phase</span> to <span>the trailing end phase</span> and back again,
  the various pieces of state are not reset; the UA must act as if the
  state was maintained.</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>reset the insertion
  mode appropriately</dfn>, it means the UA must follow these
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Let <var title="">last</var> be false.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">node</var> be the last node in the
   <span>stack of open elements</span>.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is the first node in the stack of
   open elements, then set <var title="">last</var> to true. If the
   element whose <code title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code>
   attribute is being set is neither a <code>td</code> element nor a
   <code>th</code> element, then set <var title="">node</var> to the
   element whose <code title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code>
   attribute is being set. (<span><code>innerHTML</code>
   case</span>)</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>select</code> element,
   then switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in select">in select</span>" and abort these
   steps. (<span><code>innerHTML</code> case</span>)</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>td</code> or
   <code>th</code> element, then switch the <span>insertion
   mode</span> to "<span title="insertion mode: in cell">in
   cell</span>" and abort these steps.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>tr</code> element, then
   switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span title="insertion
   mode: in row">in row</span>" and abort these steps.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>tbody</code>,
   <code>thead</code>, or <code>tfoot</code> element, then switch the
   <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span title="insertion mode: in
   table body">in table body</span>" and abort these steps.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>caption</code> element,
   then switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in caption">in caption</span>" and abort
   these steps.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>colgroup</code> element,
   then switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in column group">in column group</span>" and
   abort these steps. (<span><code>innerHTML</code> case</span>)</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>table</code> element,
   then switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in table">in table</span>" and abort these
   steps.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>head</code> element,
   then switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in body">in body</span>" ("<span
   title="insertion mode: in body">in body</span>"! <em> not "<span
   title="insertion mode: in head">in head</span>"</em>!) and abort
   these steps. (<span><code>innerHTML</code> case</span>)</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>body</code> element,
   then switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in body">in body</span>" and abort these
   steps.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is a <code>frameset</code> element,
   then switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in frameset">in frameset</span>" and abort
   these steps. (<span><code>innerHTML</code> case</span>)</li>

   <li>If <var title="">node</var> is an <code>html</code> element,
   then: if the <span><code title="">head</code> element
   pointer</span> is null, switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to
   "<span title="insertion mode: before head">before head</span>",
   otherwise, switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: after head">after head</span>". In either
   case, abort these steps. (<span><code>innerHTML</code>
   case</span>)</li> <!-- XXX can the head element pointer ever be
   non-null when we're going through these steps? -->

   <li>If <var title="">last</var> is true, then set the
   <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span title="insertion mode: in
   body">in body</span>" and abort these
   steps. (<span><code>innerHTML</code> case</span>)</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">node</var> now be the node before <var
   title="">node</var> in the <span>stack of open
   elements</span>.</li>

   <li>Return to step 3.</li>

  </ol>

<!--When you don't have to handle innerHTML, you can use this
simplified explanation instead:

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <span>stack of open elements</span> <span title="has
   an element in table scope">has a <code>td</code> or <code>th</code>
   element in table scope</span>, then switch the <span>insertion
   mode</span> to "<span title="insertion mode: in cell">in
   cell</span>".</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the <span>stack of open elements</span> <span
   title="has an element in table scope">has a <code>tr</code> element
   in table scope</span>, then switch the <span>insertion mode</span>
   to "<span title="insertion mode: in row">in row</span>".</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the <span>stack of open elements</span> <span
   title="has an element in table scope">has a <code>tbody</code>,
   <code>tfoot</code>, or <code>thead</code> element in table
   scope</span>, then switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in table body">in table
   body</span>".</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the <span>stack of open elements</span> <span
   title="has an element in table scope">has a <code>caption</code>
   element in table scope</span>, then switch the <span>insertion
   mode</span> to "<span title="insertion mode: in caption">in
   caption</span>".</p></li>

   ( you can't reach this point with a colgroup element on the
   stack )

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the <span>stack of open elements</span> <span
   title="has an element in table scope">has a <code>table</code>
   element in table scope</span>, then switch the <span>insertion

   <li><p>Otherwise, switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in body">in body</span>".</p></li>

  </ol>

  <h6>How to handle tokens in the main phase</h6>

  <p>Tokens in the main phase must be handled as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>A DOCTYPE token</dt>
   <dd>
    <p><span>Parse error</span>. Ignore the token.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>A start tag token with the tag name "html"</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>If this start tag token was not the first start tag token, then
    it is a <span>parse error</span>.</p>
    <p>For each attribute on the token, check to see if the attribute
    is already present on the top element of the <span>stack of open
    elements</span>. If it is not, add the attribute and its
    corresponding value to that element.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>An end-of-file token</dt>
   <dd>

    <p><span>Generate implied end tags.</span></p>

    <p>If there's more than one node on the <span>stack of open
    elements</span>, or, if the parser was <em>not</em> originally
    created in order to handle the setting of an element's <code
    title="dom-innerHTML-HTML">innerHTML</code> attribute
    (<span><code>innerHTML</code> case</span>) and the second node on
    the <span>stack of open elements</span> is not a <code>body</code>
    node, this is a <span>parse error</span>.</p>

    <p><span>Stop parsing.</span></p>

    <p class="big-issue">This fails because it doesn't imply HEAD and
    BODY tags. We should probably expand out the insertion modes and

1212                      1  Here's a tricky case from bug 22596:  <h5><li><h5>
1213                         How do we know that the 2nd <h5> should close the <LI> rather than nest inside the <LI>?
1214                         (Afterall, the <h5> is a legal child of the <LI>).
1215               
1216                         The way you know is that there is no root between the two, so the <h5> binds more
1217                         tightly to the 1st <h5> than to the <LI>.
1218                      2.  Also, bug 6148 shows this case: <SPAN><DIV><SPAN>
1219                         From this case we learned not to execute this logic if the parent is a block.

1221                      3. Fix for 26583
1222                         Ex. <A href=foo.html><B>foo<A href-bar.html>bar</A></B></A>  <- A legal HTML
1223                         In the above example clicking on "foo" or "bar" should link to
1224                         foo.html or bar.html respectively. That is, the inner <A> should be informed
1225                         about the presence of an open <A> above <B>..so that the inner <A> can close out
1226                         the outer <A>. The following code does it for us.
1227

815             // Here's a problem.  If theTag is legal in here, we don't move it

817             // gets closed at this point.  But some things are legal
818             // _everywhere_ and hence would effectively close out misplaced
819             // content in tables.  This is undesirable, so treat them as
820             // illegal here so they'll be shipped out with their parents and
821             // siblings.  See bug 40855 for an explanation (that bug was for
822             // comments, but the same issues arise with whitespace, newlines,
823             // noscript, etc).  Script is special, though.  Shipping it out

  <h2 id="rendering">Rendering <span title="TBW">[TBW]</span></h2>

  <p class="big-issue">This section will probably include details on
  how to render DATAGRID, drag-and-drop, etc, in a visual media, in
  concert with CSS.</p>

  <p>CSS UAs in visual media must, when scrolling a page to a fragment
  identifier, align the top of the viewport with the target element's
  top border edge.</p> <!-- XXX horiz pos given bidi, and not
  scrolling when not required to? -->


  <h3>Rendering and the DOM</h3>

  <p class="big-issue">This section is wrong. mediaMode will end up on
  Window, I think. All views implement Window.</p>

  <p>Any object implement the <code>AbstractView</code> interface must
  also implement the <code>MediaModeAbstractView</code> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>MediaModeAbstractView</dfn> {
  readonly attribute DOMString <span>mediaMode</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn><code>mediaMode</code></dfn> attribute on objects
  implementing the <code>MediaModeAbstractView</code> interface must
  return the string that represents the canvas' current rendering mode
  (<code>screen</code>, <code>print</code>, etc). This is a lowercase
  string, as <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html#media-types">defined by
  the CSS specification</a>. <a href="#refsCSS21">[CSS21]</a></p>

  <p>Some user agents may support multiple media, in which case there
  will exist multiple objects implementing the
  <code>AbstractView</code> interface. Only the default view
  implements the <code>Window</code> interface. The other views can be
  reached using the <code>view</code> attribute of the
  <code>UIEvent</code> inteface, during event propagation. There is no
  way currently to enumerate all the views.</p>

  <!-- XXX examples! -->



  <h2 id="no">Things that you can't do with this specification because
  they are better handled using other technologies that are further
  described herein</h2>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>There are certain features that are not handled by this
  specification because a client side markup language is not the right
  level for them, or because the features exist in other languages
  that can be integrated into this one. This section covers some of
  the more common requests.</p>

  <h3>Localisation</h3>

  <p>If you wish to create localised versions of an HTML application,
  the best solution is to preprocess the files on the server, and then
  use HTTP content negotation to serve the appropriate language.</p>

  <!-- <p>XXX example here</p> -->

  <h3>Declarative 2D vector graphics and animation</h3>

  <p>Embedding vector graphics into XHTML documents is the domain of
  SVG.</p>

  <!-- <p>XXX example here</p> -->

  <h3>Declarative 3D scenes</h3>

  <p>Embedding 3D imagery into XHTML documents is the domain of X3D,
  or technologies based on X3D that are namespace-aware.</p>

  <!-- <p>XXX example here</p> -->


  <h3><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Alternate style sheets: the <code>DocumentStyle</code> interface</h3>

  <p>This section describes an extension to the
  <code>DocumentStyle</code> interface introduced in DOM2 Style. <a
  href="#refsDOM2STYLE">[DOM2STYLE]</a></p>

  <p>It is expected that this section will be moved to a W3C CSS
  working group or WebAPI working group specification in the next few
  months.</p>

<pre class="idl">// Introduced in DOM Level 2: <a href="#refsDOM2STYLE">[DOM2STYLE]</a>
interface <dfn>DocumentStyle</dfn> {
  readonly attribute StyleSheetList <span>styleSheets</span>;

  // New in this specification:
           attribute DOMString <span>selectedStyleSheetSet</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span>lastStyleSheetSet</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span>preferredStyleSheetSet</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMStringList <span>styleSheetSets</span>;
  void <span>enableStyleSheetsForSet</span>(in DOMString name);
};</pre>

  <p>Any object implementing the <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface
  must also implement the <code>DocumentStyle</code> interface.</p>

  <p>For this interface, the <code>DOMString</code> values "null" and
  "the empty string" are distinct, and must not be considered
  equivalent.</p>

  <p>A style sheet is said to <dfn>have a title</dfn> if the
  <code>title</code> attribute or pseudo-attribute of the DOM node
  that introduced the style sheet is present and has a non-empty value
  (i.e. if the <code>title</code> attribute of the
  <code>StyleSheet</code> object returned by the <code>sheet</code>
  attribute of the <code>LinkStyle</code> interface of that DOM node
  is neither null nor the empty string).</p>

  <p>The new members are defined as follows:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn><code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code></dfn> of type <code>DOMString</code></dt>
   <dd>

        <p>This attribute indicates which style sheet set (<a
        href="#refsHTML4">[HTML4]</a>) is in use. This attribute is
        <span>live</span>; changing the disabled attribute on style
        sheets directly will change the value of this attribute.</p>

        <p>If all the sheets that are enabled and <span>have a
        title</span> have the <em>same</em> title (by
        <span>case-sensitive</span><!--XXX xref --> comparisons)
        then the value of this attribute must be exactly equal to the
        title of the first enabled style sheet with a title in the
        <code>styleSheets</code> list. Otherwise, if style sheets from
        different sets are enabled, then the return value must be null
        (there is no way to determine what the currently selected
        style sheet set is in those conditions).  Otherwise, either
        all style sheets that <span>have a title</span> are disabled,
        or there are no alternate style sheets, and
        <code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code> must return the empty
        string.</p>

        <p>Setting this attribute to the null value must have no
        effect.</p>

        <p>Setting this attribute to a non-null value must call
        <code>enableStyleSheetsForSet()</code> with that value as the
        function's argument, and set <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code>
        to that value.</p>

        <p>From the DOM's perspective, all views have the same
        <code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code>. If a UA supports multiple
        views with different selected alternate style sheets, then this
        attribute (and the <code>StyleSheet</code> interface's
        <code>disabled</code> attribute) must return and set the value
        for the default view.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn><code>lastStyleSheetSet</code></dfn> of type <code>DOMString</code>, readonly</dt>
    <dd>

        <p>This property must initially have the value null. Its value
        changes when the <code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code> attribute
        is set.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn><code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code></dfn> of type <code>DOMString</code>, readonly</dt>
    <dd>

        <p>This attribute must return the preferred style sheet set as
        set by the author. It is determined from the order of style
        sheet declarations and the <code>Default-Style</code> HTTP
        headers, as eventually defined elsewhere in this
        specification<!-- XXX xref -->. If there is no preferred style
        sheet set, this attribute must return the empty string. The
        case of this attribute must exactly match the case given by
        the author where the preferred style sheet is specified or
        implied. This attribute must never return null.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn><code>styleSheetSets</code></dfn> of type <code>DOMStringList</code>, readonly</dt>
    <dd>

        <p>This must return the <span>live</span> list of the
        currently available style sheet sets. This list is constructed
        by enumerating all the style sheets for this document
        available to the implementation, in the order they are listed
        in the <code>styleSheets</code> attribute, adding the title of
        each style sheet with a title to the list, avoiding duplicates
        by dropping titles that match
        (<span>case-sensitively</span><!-- XXX xref -->) titles that
        have already been added to the list.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn title="enableStyleSheetsForSet()"><code>enableStyleSheetsForSet(<var title="">name</var>)</code></dfn>, method</dt>
    <dd>

        <p>Calling this method must change the <code>disabled</code>
        attribute on each <code>StyleSheet</code> object with a title
        attribute with a length greater than 0 in the
        <code>styleSheets</code> attribute, so that all those whose
        title matches the <var title="">name</var> argument are
        enabled, and all others are disabled. Title matches must be
        <span>case-sensitive</span><!-- XXX xref -->.  Calling this
        method with the empty string disables all alternate and
        preferred style sheets (but does not change the state of
        persistent style sheets, that is those with no title
        attribute).</p>

        <p>Calling this method with a null value must have no
        effect.</p>

        <p>Style sheets that do not <span>have a title</span> are
        never affected by this method. This method does not change the
        values of the <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code> or
        <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code> attributes.</p>

    </dd>
   </dl>

  <h4>Dynamically adding new style sheets</h4>

  <p>If new style sheets with titles are added to the document, the UA must
  decide whether or not the style sheets should be initially enabled or
  not. How this happens depends on the exact state of the document at
  the time the style sheet is added, as follows.</p>

  <h5>Adding style sheets</h5>

  <p>First, if the style sheet is a preferred style sheet (it has a
  title, but is not marked as alternate), and there is no current
  preferred style sheet (the <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code>
  attribute is equal to the empty string) then the
  <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code> attribute is set to the exact
  value of this style sheet's title. (This changes the preferred
  style sheet set, which causes further changes &mdash; see below.)</p>

  <p>Then, for all sheets, if any of the following is true, then the
  style sheet must be enabled:</p>

  <ul>

     <li> The style sheet has an empty title.</li>

     <li> The <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code> is null, and the style
     sheet's title matches (by <span>case-sensitive</span><!-- XXX
     xref --> match) the value of the
     <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code> attribute.</li>

     <li> The style sheet's title matches (by
     <span>case-sensitive</span><!-- XXX xref --> match) the value
     of the <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code> attribute.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Otherwise, the style sheet must be disabled.</p>


  <h5>Changing the preferred style sheet set</h5>

  <p>The first time the preferred style sheet set is set, which is
  either before any alternate style sheets are seen (e.g. using a
  "Default-Style" HTTP header), or is the first time a titled,
  non-alternate style sheet is seen (in the absence of information to
  the contrary, the first titled non-alternate sheet sets the name of
  the preferred set), the <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code>
  attribute's value must be set to the name of that preferred style
  sheet set. This does not change the <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code>
  attribute.</p>

  <p>If the UA has the preferred style sheet set changed, for example
  if it receives a "Default-Style:" HTTP header after it receives HTTP
  "Link:" headers implying another preferred style sheet, then the
  <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code> attribute's value must be
  changed appropriately, and, if the <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code> is
  null, the <code>enableStyleSheetsForSet()</code> method must be
  called with the new <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code> value. (The
  <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code> attribute is, again, not
  changed.)</p>


 <h5> Examples</h5>
<div class="example">
  <p>Thus, in the following HTML snippet:</p>

<pre>&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="foo" href="a"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="bar" href="b"&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  document.selectedStyleSheetSet = 'foo';
  document.styleSheets[1].disabled = false;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="foo" href="c"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="bar" href="d"&gt;</pre>

  <p>...the style sheets that end up enabled are style sheets "a", "b",
  and "c", the <code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code> attribute would
  return null, <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code> would return "foo", and
  <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code> would return "".</p>

 <p> Similarly, in the following HTML snippet:</p>

<pre>&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="foo" href="a"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="bar" href="b"&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var before = document.preferredStyleSheetSet;
  document.styleSheets[1].disabled = false;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" title="foo" href="c"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="bar" href="d"&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var after = document.preferredStyleSheetSet;
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

  <p>...the "before" variable will be equal to the empty string, the
  "after" variable will be equal to "foo", and style sheets "a" and "c"
  will be enabled. This is the case even though the first script block
  sets style sheet "b" to be enabled, because upon parsing the
  following <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, the
  <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code> is set and the
  <code>enableStyleSheetsForSet()</code> method is called (since
  <code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code> was never set explicitly, leaving
  <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code> at null throughout), which changes
  which style sheets are enabled and which are not.</p>
</div>

  <h4>Interaction with the User Interface</h4>

  <p>The user interface of Web browsers that support style sheets
  should list the style sheet titles given in the
  <code>styleSheetSets</code> list, showing the
  <code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code> as the selected style sheet set,
  leaving none selected if it is null or the empty string, and
  selecting an extra option "Basic Page Style" (or similar) if it is
  the empty string and the <code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code> is the
  empty string as well.</p>

  <p>Selecting a style sheet from this list should set the
  <code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code> attribute. This (by definition)
  affects the <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code> attribute.</p>


  <h5>Persisting the selected style sheet set</h5>

  <p>If UAs persist the selected style sheet set, they should use the
  value of the <code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code> attribute, or if
  that is null, the <code>lastStyleSheetSet</code> attribute, when
  leaving the page (or at some other time) to determine the set name
  to store. If that is null then the style sheet set should not be
  persisted.</p>

  <p>When re-setting the style sheet set to the persisted value (which can
  happen at any time, typically at the first time the style sheets are
  needed for styling the document, after the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document has
  been parsed, after any scripts that are not dependent on computed
  style have executed), the style sheet set should be set by setting the
  <code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code> attribute as if the user had selected the set
  manually.

  <p class="note">This specification does not give any suggestions on
  how UAs should decide to persist the style sheet set or whether or
  how to persist the selected set across pages.</p>


  <h4>Future compatibility</h4>

  <p>Future versions of CSS may introduce ways of having alternate
  style sheets declared at levels lower than the top level, i.e.
  embedded within other style sheets. Implementations of this
  specification that also support this proposed declaration of
  alternate style sheets are expected to perform depth-first traversals
  of the <code>styleSheets</code> list, not simply enumerations of the
  <code>styleSheets</code> list that only contains the top level.</p>




  <h3><span title="SCS">[SCS]</span> Timers</h3>

  <p>This section is expected to be moved to the Window Object
  specification in due course.</p>

<pre class="idl">
interface <dfn>WindowTimers</dfn> {
  // timers
  long <span>setTimeout</span>(in <span>TimeoutHandler</span> handler, in long timeout);
  long <span>setTimeout</span>(in <span>TimeoutHandler</span> handler, in long timeout, <var title="">arguments...</var>);
  long <span>setTimeout</span>(in DOMString code, in long timeout);
  long <span>setTimeout</span>(in DOMString code, in long timeout, in DOMString language);
  void <span>clearTimeout</span>(in long handle);
  long <span>setInterval</span>(in <span>TimeoutHandler</span> handler, in long timeout);
  long <span>setInterval</span>(in <span>TimeoutHandler</span> handler, in long timeout, <var title="">arguments...</var>);
  long <span>setInterval</span>(in DOMString code, in long timeout);
  long <span>setInterval</span>(in DOMString code, in long timeout, in DOMString language);
  void <span>clearInterval</span>(in long handle);
};

interface <dfn>TimeoutHandler</dfn> {
  void handleEvent(<var title="">arguments...</var>);
};
</pre>

  <p>The <code>WindowTimers</code> interface must be obtainable from
  any <code>Window</code> object using binding-specific casting
  methods.</p>

  <p>The <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> methods
  allow authors to schedule timer-based events.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="setTimeout"><code>setTimeout(<var
  title="">handler</var>, <var title="">timeout</var>[, <var
  title="">arguments...</var>])</code></dfn> method takes a reference
  to a <code>TimeoutHandler</code> object and a length of time in
  milliseconds. It must return a handle to the timeout created, and
  then asynchronously wait <var title="">timeout</var> milliseconds
  and then invoke <code>handleEvent()</code> on the <var
  title="">handler</var> object. If any <var
  title="">arguments...</var> were provided, they must be passed to
  the <var title="">handler</var> as arguments to the
  <code>handleEvent()</code> function.</p>

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, the ECMAScript native
  <code>Function</code> type must implement the
  <code>TimeoutHandler</code> interface such that invoking the
  <code>handleEvent()</code> method of that interface on the object
  from another language binding invokes the function itself, with the
  arguments passed to <code>handleEvent()</code> as the arguments
  passed to the function. In the ECMAScript DOM binding itself, however,
  the <code>handleEvent()</code> method of the interface is not
  directly accessible on <code>Function</code> objects. Such functions
  must be called in the global scope.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, <dfn title=""><code>setTimeout(<var
  title="">code</var>, <var title="">timeout</var>[, <var
  title="">language</var>])</code></dfn> may be used. This variant
  takes a string instead of a <code>TimeoutHandler</code> object. That
  string must be parsed using the specified <var title="">language</var>
  (defaulting to ECMAScript if the third argument is omitted) and
  executed in the global scope.</p>

  <p class="big-issue">Need to define <var title="">language</var> values.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>setInterval(...)</code></dfn> variants must work
  in the same way as the <code>setTimeout</code> variants except that
  the <var title="">handler</var> or <code>code</code> must be invoked
  again every <var title="">timeout</var> milliseconds, not just the
  once.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code>clearTimeout()</code></dfn> and
  <dfn><code>clearInterval()</code></dfn> methods take one integer (the
  value returned by <code>setTimeout</code> and
  <code>setInterval</code> respectively) and must cancel the specified
  timeout. When called with a value that does not correspond to an
  active timeout or interval, the methods must return without doing
  anything.</p>

  <p>Timeouts must never fire while another script is executing. (Thus
  the HTML scripting model is strictly single-threaded and not
  reentrant.)</p>

Robert Bateman:

   I've looked thru as many of the examples from around the web as I can find and
   don't see an obvious way to do date calculations.

   What I'm trying to do is populate an xsd:date field with now() plus 5 days as
   it's default value.  The field in question is a proposed "due date" for a
   work order.

   I've seen that I can get a "difference" between two dates, but no
   calculations.

Disclosure triangles


I think UAs should automatically highlight the accesskey (or add it in    
brackets if it isn't already in the string). I am thinking of writing some
text - optional, of course, since this wouldn't apply to all UAs or all  
platforms - that specifies this.

I also think that there should be an accesskey value which is basically   
"auto", and which picks a non-clashing access key based on the element    
content.



| adding HTTP authentication capabilities to HTML allow sites to:
|   - remove a site's authentication state from the browser when
|     activated (i.e., a "log out" interface)
|   - add user data to a site's authentication state in the browser
|     (i.e., "log on" interfaces)
|   - display the user's current authentication state
| 
| There are a few good reasons to do this. Many sites use cookies to
| authenticate users, because HTTP authentication doesn't have any
| mechanism to allow logging out (a key requirement of financial
| institutions and other sensitive applications), and because the UI for
| HTTP authentication can't be controlled, and doesn't offer an
| "anyonymous" / "not logged in" view.
| 
| By accommodating HTTP authentication in Web forms, it will be possible
| to have styled, custom "log on" interfaces as part of pages, as well
| as "log out" facilities, while still retaining the benefits of HTTP
| authentication.
| 
| Specifically, HTTP authentication is more secure than cookies (when
| Digest auth is used), and is more amenable to automated processes
| (agents, spiders, etc.) as well as alternate browsing devices (screen
| readers, etc.).

DH: I was arguing that you should be able to get the CSS info for
document fragments if you had an owner document with CSS in it.



So maybe:

   var library = new ZipFile("data.zip");
   library.onload = function() {
      var sound1 = library.getAudio("sound1.wav"); // returns an Audio object
      var image1 = library.getImage("image1.png"); // returns an HTMLImageElement
      var doc1 = library.getXMLDocument("doc1.xml"); // returns a Document
      var doc2 = library.getHTMLDocument("doc1.html"); // returns an HTMLDocument
   }

Also maybe supporting more than one file at a time:

   var library = new ResourceLoader("data.zip");
   library.add("moredata.zip");
   library.onload = function() { ... }
   library.onloading = function() {
      reportLoadProgress(library.progress); // 0.0 .. 1.0
   }

...although I'm not sure how we would then deal with filename clashes.

   var library = new AudioZip("sounds.zip");
   library.onload = function() {
      var sound1 = library["sound1.wav"];
      sound.play();
   }


If we define onbeforeunload, then we have to say that the JS
implementation of EventListener::handleEvent checks for that event,
treating the return value as the string to use for the unload warning
message if there is a return value, and calling preventDefault if
there isn't.

Jens Meiert:
- For non-native English speakers, it's sometimes difficult to understand
the difference between <cite /> and <quote />, since citations often seem to
be quoted, too (this is a presentational aspect, I know).
- Is it right that the <dfn /> element [1] /must/ be used only in the
context of the definition of the enclosed term (as the example suggests)?
(If so, wouldn't it be useful to add this note, too?)
- Last, ain't it still kind of misleading that the definition list [2] is
called like this, though it rather seems like a kind of 'assigment' or
'attribution list'? (I always wondered about this a bit.)

In other areas, however, the replacement is not a match in terms of functionality. Like it or not, but showModalDialog is a better way to provide feature-rich user feedback windows than window.confirm (which Firefox supports, even though there is NO PUBLIC STANDARD for it). With showModalDialog, I can pop a window offering "Yes," "No," or "Cancel" buttons that requires a response before proceeding. With window.confirm, I have to craft all my questions as something to which "OK" or "Cancel" makes sense, never mind asking for three, four, or five state responses.

HTMLImageElement.click(x, y); (for Csaba Gabor)
or clickPoint, if click() can't be done in IE
can this be emulated in IE by posting a synthetic moue click event
with those X and Y coords?


<menulabel>, or rather menus in general, need an icon attribute and a
hide attribute, like the <command> element.


What about safe clipboard access.
As discussed before by others as well:
The user initiates a paste action as recognized by the UISystem the user is working in.
E.g pressing Ctrl-V or selecting paste from a context menu.
An event is fired and a Listener can now access the pasted data as part of the event object.
The same for cut and copy. The Listner can set data as part of the event object.
This is safe and will not allow any script to mess with the clipboard without the user specifically asking for it
by initiating a cut/copy/paste action.

<Hixie> vlad: you should define what the UA should do with out-of-order aDATs

<Hixie> yes i know it's an error
<Hixie> but that doesn't say what the UA should do
<pav> error == image is invalid
<vlad> yep
<vlad> either broken image icon

<vlad> up to the UA
<Hixie> right
<Hixie> you should say which one
<pav> its up to the UA
<Hixie> why?
<vlad> "SHOULD display the first frame, but MAY display broken image icon if that's not convenient", in rfc parlance
<vlad> because it's not useful to specify that, IMO
<Hixie> up to the UA means one UA will implement something, it'll become a popular UA, then all the others will have to copy it.
<vlad> how a UA wants to handle image errors is up to the UA
<pav> we're designing an image format, not the html image tag
<pav> the html spec should say what to do with it


should we say that elements in HTML must be lowercase? (but with error
handling for uppercase tags, obviously)? If so, update examples.

<title> is for out of context headers
<h1> is for in-context headers

The parsing rules of HTML

media="" is case-insensitive
case-sensitivity of other attributes, and what it means

empty title attribute is equivalent to missing attribute for purposes
of alternate style sheet processing

<Hixie> here's how <object> works (assuming you don't support ActiveX)
<Hixie> 1. look at the data="" attribute. If it's not there, go to the step i'll label "bail" below.
<Hixie> 2. fetch the file indicated by the data="" attribute.
<Hixie> 3. while waiting for the MIME type, treat <object> as a replaced element of transparent nothingness, intrinsic size zero.
<hyatt> (so we would honor width/height)
<hyatt> (because it's replaced)
<Hixie> (yes)
<Hixie> 4. if the MIME type is a long time coming (e.g. DNS is being slow) then jump to the "bail" step below until you have the MIME type, then jump back to step 5.
<Hixie> 5. Once you have the MIME type, examine it. If it's a plugin type, jump to the plugin step below. If it's an image, jump to the image step below. If it's a document type (HTML, XML, etc) jump to the iframe step below. Otherwise, you don't recognise it, and jump to the "bail" step.
<Hixie> plugin step: collect all the <param> element children in the <object>. instantiate the plugin and pass the params to it.
<Hixie> image step: render the <object> as if it was an <img>
<Hixie> document step: render the <object> as if it was an <iframe>
<Hixie> bail step: render the <object> as if it was a <span>
 - if there is no authoratative MIME type, then use the type="" attribute.
 - if type="" is something you know you don't support, you MAY not download it
 - if type="" is dynamically changed, do nothing
 - if data="" is dynamically changed, redo loop

<hyatt> apparently your url can come from <param>
<hyatt> not just the data attribute
<hyatt> our code looks for params with "src", "movie", "code" and "url"
<hyatt> and also tries to find the type on a param
<Hixie> oh that's you trying to have hacky activex support
<Hixie> opera does that too
<hyatt> yeah we support activex versions of plugins that are common
<hyatt> like flash and quicktime and realaudio
<Hixie> that would be a step 1b. if no data attribute, then look for a <param> to get you a URL instead.
<Hixie> and if you find one, carry on as if that was your data="".


XMDP or something should be at the end of profile="".

  <p>In the ECMAScript DOM binding, objects implementing this interface
  can also be dereferenced using square bracket notation (e.g.

  method with that index, and dereferencing with a string index is
  equivalent to invoking the <code>namedItem()</code> method with that

"you have mail": bubble notification; flash taskbar button,

events should bubble from documents to Window

say something about events fired on <body> -> document -> window, like
onload? onpopstate is defined as body->html->doc->window; as is the
local storage event. What about the old ones, how do they work? load,
error, scroll, resize, etc?

If we assuming that bubbling events bubble from document to window,
then it seems reasonable for scroll events that bubble to be fired at
the document if the window is resized, and scroll events that don't
bubble to be fired at elements if they are scrolled. window.onscroll
and document.onscroll should both work.


[HIT TESTING TRANSPARENCY]
Definition: IE considers a point of an element "transparent" if any
one of the following are true:

 1. All of the following are true:
    a: The computed value of 'background-image' is 'none', and
    b: The computed value of 'background-color' is 'transparent', and
    c: The point is over a pixel of an AlphaImageLoader filter image
       that has an alpha value of 0 (fully transparent), or the
       element does not have an AlphaImageLoader filter applied;

 2. The point is outside the element's CSS clip rectangle;

 3. The computed value of 'visibility' is 'hidden';

 4. The element is a transparent IFRAME (in IE, an IFRAME with the
    custom attribute "allowtransparency");

 5. The element is an OBJECT with the custom attribute "wmode" set to 
    "transparent" and the point in question is fully transparent.

Given those definitions, when a mouse event occurs, IE finds the
target element as follows:

   A. Take the topmost node that is under the point where the pointer
      was for the event. For CSS boxes, borders, padding areas and
      content areas are considered part of the node, margins and
      leading generated by the 'line-height' property are not.

   B. If there is no node at that point, no event is fired. STOP.

   C. If the node is a text node, then the event is fired at the text
      node's nearest ancestor element node. STOP.

   D. If the node is not an element, assign the node's nearest
      ancestor element node to a variable X. Otherwise, assign the
      element node itself to X.

   E. If the element X is the BODY element or the HTML element and its
      document is not the document of a transparent IFRAME, goto step
      H. Similarly, if the element X is a TABLE element, or is an IMG
      element, goto step H.

   F. If the point where the pointer was is, per the above definition,
      a point that on the element X is transparent, then ignore that
      element and assign the element that is below that element in the
      stacking order to X. If there is no element below X, or if the
      point on X is not transparent and so the previous condition
      doesn't apply, then leave X as is and go straight to step H.

   G. Goto step E.

   H. If the element X is now a BODY or TABLE element, but the element
      assigned to X in step D was some other element, assign the
      element originally assigned in step D back to X.

   I. The event goes to X. STOP

  and the element's own <code>disabled</code> attribute is absent,
  then the command's Action must be triggered as the default
  action.</p>

  <p>If the command's Disabled State is true (disabled) then the
  element must be disabled. The <code>command</code> element must also
  be disabled if the element's <code>disabled</code> attribute is
  set.</p>

  <p>If the command's Checked State is true (checked) then the
  element must be checked. The <code>command</code> element must also
  be checked if the element's <code>checked</code> attribute is
  set.</p>

  <p>When a <code title="command-element">command</code> element has a
  <code title="command-attribute">command</code> attribute, any <code
  title="attr-command-type">type</code> and <code
  title="attr-command-radiogroup">radiogroup</code> attribute is
  ignored.</p>



  <h4>The 'icon' property</h4>

  <p>UAs should use the command's Icon as the default generic icon
  provided by the user agent when the 'icon' property computes to
  'auto' on an element that either defines a command or refers to one
  using the <code title="command-attribute">command</code>
  attribute.</p>

  <h4 id="pseudosAndCommands">CSS pseudo-classes and commands</h4>

  <p>When an element uses the <code
  title="command-attribute">command</code> attribute, any UI
  pseudo-classes from the following list that apply to the element
  defining the command also apply to the elements that refer to that
  command.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>:enabled, :disabled</dt>

   <dd>Matches commands whose Disabled State facet is False and True
   respectively.</dd>

   <dt>:checked</dt>

   <dd>Matches commands whose Type facet is either "radio" or
   "checkbox", and whose Checked State facet is true.</dd>

  </dl>



  <p><code>menu</code> elements with explicit <code>label</code>
  attributes, and <code>menu</code> elements following
  <code>menulabel</code> elements, should be hidden. In CSS-aware UAs,
  this effect should be achieved by including the following rules, or
  their equivalent, in the UA's user agent style sheet:</p>

  <pre>@namespace xh url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);
xh|menu[label], xh|menulabel + xh|menu { display: none; }</pre>

  <p>All other <code>menu</code> elements should be rendered
  identically to <code>ul</code> elements. In CSS-aware UAs, this
  effect may be achieved by including rules similar to the following
  in the UA's user agent style sheet:</p>

  <pre>@namespace xh url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);
xh|menu { display: block; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style: disc; }</pre>




  <h5>Displaying menus</h5>

  <p>When a <code>menu</code> element is activated, the associated
  menu should be constructed and shown. (For details on how a
  <code>menu</code> element can be activated, see the sections on
  <span>menu links</span> and <span>menu bars</span>.)</p>

  <p>The styles applied to each element in the <code>menu</code>
  element, as well as the element itself, may be applied when
  constructing a menu. UAs are recommended to not apply styling to
  context menus and menus for application menu bars, and to only use
  styles for in-page menus.</p>

  <p>If user agents support styling of menus, they should only support
  the '<code>background</code>', '<code>color</code>',
  '<code>border</code>', '<code>padding</code>' and
  '<code>font</code>' properties on menus and menu items. (This list
  might be incomplete; in general, properties that merely affect the
  appearance of the element should work, but properties that affect
  the layout should not.)</p>

  <p>As the user interacts with a menu, the elements from which the
  menu was created should have appropriate pseudo-classes (:hover,
  :focus, :active) applied.</p>

  <p>The menu items must only consider the computed styles of the
  elements from which they were derived, not other elements.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, take this menu:</p>

   <pre>&lt;menu&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;command label="a"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;menu&gt;</pre>

   <p>The menu has one menu item, labelled "a".</p>

   <p>Styles applied to the <code>li</code> element in this menu would
   have no effect on the rendered menu, except in so far as styles
   inherit from that element to the <code>command</code> element.</p>

   <p>Styles applied to the <code>command</code> element could affect
   the menu. While the user is hovering over the menu item, the
   <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class matches the <code>command</code>
   element and any appropriate newly matching rules could be
   applied.</p>

  </div>

  <p>When activated from a <span title="menu links">menu link</span>,
  a menu must be placed in an Appropriate Place. Specifically, if the
  <code>a</code> element is displayed as a vertically-stacked box (as
  is typically seen for elements with '<code>display: block</code>',
  '<code>list-item</code>', or '<code>table</code>'), then the menu
  should appear vertically below the element, anchored so that one of
  its top corners coincides with a bottom corner of the box so that
  the menu and the box each have a horizontal sides in common (or a
  bottom corner of the menu coincides with a top corner of the box, if
  there isn't enough room for the menu to drop down); otherwise, if
  the element is displayed as a horizontally stacked box
  ('<code>display: inline</code>', '<code>table-cell</code>', etc),
  the menu should appear to the <em>side</em> of the box in an
  analogous way. If the element is on the right of the page, the menu
  should drop to the left, and vice versa.</p>

  <p>UAs should implement the drop-down behaviour in more
  platform-appropriate ways if the platform conventions differ from
  the behaviour described above.</p>




  <h4>The <dfn title="command-attribute"><code>command</code></dfn>
  attribute</h4>

  <p>Any element that can define a command can also, instead, have a
  <code>command</code> attribute that specifies the ID of a command
  that the element should defer to. In this case the element does not
  define a command, but, in the absence of attributes to the contrary,
  reflects the state of the element specified.</p>

  <p>If the <code>command</code> attribute specifies an ID that is not
  the ID of an element that defines a command, then the
  <code>command</code> DOM attribute is set to the null value, and the
  element acts as if it was linked to an element that defined a
  command with no Label, no Hint, no Icon, no Action, that was not
  Hidden, not Disabled, not Checked, and that was of Type
  "command".</p>

  <p>The most direct way to represent a command is by using the <code
  title="command-element">command</code> element. A <code
  title="command-element">command</code> element defines a command if
  it does not have a <code title="command-attribute">command</code>
  attribute.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <pre>...
 &lt;command id="c_stop" label="Emergency Stop" onclick="dostop()"/&gt;
 &lt;command id="c_go" label="Go" onclick="dogo()"/&gt;
 &lt;command id="c_lamp" label="Headlamps" onclick="dof2()" disabled="disabled"/&gt;
...</pre>
</div>

  <p>The <code>command</code> element, in addition to the core and
  internationalisation attributes, may have the following
  attributes specified:</p>

  <dl>

   <!-+- yes i know that some of these are core attributes. If you can
   give me a better introductory paragraph, I'm all for it. -+->

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-type"><code>type</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>The command's Type. If present, this attribute must either have
   the value <code>radio</code>, in which case the command is of Type
   "radio", or the value <code>checkbox</code>, in which case the
   command is (amazingly) of Type "checkbox". Any other value, or the
   absence of the attribute altogether, means that the command is of
   Type "command".</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-id"><code>id</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>The command's ID. If this attribute is not specified, then the
   command is anonymous.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-label"><code>label</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>The command's Label. If the attribute is not specified, the
   command's Label is given by the element's <code>textContent</code>
   DOM attribute.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-title"><code>title</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>The command's Hint. If the attribute is not specified, the
   command's Hint is the empty string.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-icon"><code>icon</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>A URI to the command's Icon. If the attribute is not specified,
   then the command has no Icon.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-onclick"><code>onclick</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>An event handler attribute that listens for <code>click</code>
   events.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-hide"><code>hide</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>The command's Hidden State. If the attribute is present, the
   command is hidden (and also disabled, regardless of the value of
   the <code>disabled</code> attribute), otherwise, the command is
   shown. If the attribute is present, it should have the value
   "<code>hide</code>". <!-+-The name of the attribute reflects the
   fact that Hidden commands in menus are hidden.-+-></dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>The command's Disabled State. If the attribute is present, the
   command is disabled, otherwise, the command is enabled. If the
   attribute is present, it should have the value
   "<code>disabled</code>".</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-checked"><code>checked</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>The command's Checked State. If the attribute is present, the
   command is checked, otherwise, the command is not. If the attribute
   is present, it should have the value "<code>checked</code>".</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-radiogroup"><code>radiogroup</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>An attribute indicating the name of the group of commands that
   will be toggled when the command itself is toggled. (Described <a
   href="#radiocommand">below</a>.)</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="attr-command-default"><code>default</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>An attribute indicating whether the command is the default
   command. If the attribute is present, the command is the default
   command, otherwise it is not. If it is set, it should have the
   value <code>default</code>. Used by context menus to indicate what
   the default option would be. The :default pseudo-class matches
   <code>command</code> elements with this attribute.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>In addition, <code title="command-element">command</code>
  elements may also have a <code
  title="command-attribute">command</code> attribute, as <a
  href="#command-with-command">described below</a>.</p>

  <p>The Type, ID, Label, Hint, Icon, Hidden State, Disabled State,
  and Checked State of the command defined by a <code
  title="command-element">command</code> element are as described
  above. The Action of a <code title="command-element">command</code>
  element is that a <code>{"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events",
  "click"}</code> event is fired on the element.</p>

  <p>If the Type of the command is "checkbox", when a
  <code>click</code> event is dispatched on the element, user agents
  must toggle the value of the <code>checked</code> attribute before
  the event is dispatched in the document. (If the attribute is
  absent, then it is set to the value <code>checked</code>, and if the
  attribute is present, it is removed.) If the default action of the
  event is canceled, the value of the attribute must be changed back
  to the value it had before the event was dispatched.</p>

  <p id="radiocommand">If the Type of the command is "radio", when a
  <code>click</code> event is dispatched on the element, user agents
  must set the value of the <code>checked</code> attribute on the
  element to <code>checked</code>, and remove the attribute from any
  <code>command</code> elements with <code>type</code> set to
  <code>radio</code> and the same parent element and same
  <code>radiogroup</code> attribute, before the event is dispatched in
  the document. (If the element has no <code>radiogroup</code>
  attribute, then the elements "with the same <code>radiogroup</code>
  attribute" are those elements with <em>no</em>
  <code>radiogroup</code> attribute.) If the default action of the
  event is canceled, the value of the attributes that were changed
  must be changed back to the values they had before the event was
  dispatched.</p>

  <p>In HTML the <code>command</code> element is an empty element with
  no end tag.</p>

  <p>Authors should put <code>command</code> elements inside the
  <code>head</code> element, inside any element that may contain
  <span>block-level elements</span> or <span>inline-level
  content</span>, or inside <code>commandset</code> elements.</p> <!-+-
  should, because hey, if they want to put them elsewhere, why not.
  XXX -+->

  <p>Authors should not put elements or text inside
  <code>command</code> elements.</p>




  <p>The <code title="dom-command-ro-command">command</code> DOM attribute

window.getAttention() or some similar API to let the user know the

ITEM

Items have:
 - parents, children
 - properties
 - commands that can apply to them



   <li>Inline markup for pop-up windows, for example for dialog boxes
   or tool palettes, so that dialogs need not be defined in separate
   files.</li>

   <li>Command updating: applications that have several access
   points for the same feature, for instance a menu item and a
   tool-bar button, would benefit from having to disable such
   commands only once, instead of having to keep each access point
   synchronized with the feature's availability at all times.
   Similarly menu items or tool-bar buttons that represent a toggle
   state could automatically stay synchronized whenever
   toggled.</li>

   <li>More device-independent DOM events: The DOM event set needs
   device-independent events, such as events that fire when a button
   or link is activated, whether via the mouse or the keyboard.
   <code>DOMActivate</code> is a start, but it lacks equivalent HTML
   attributes, and additional events may be needed.</li>

   <li>Richer widget set: the existing HTML controls are quite
   limited, some controls for commonly used types such as date
   controls and range controls would be useful.</li>

   <li>Sortable and multicolumn tree views and list views with rich
   formatting.</li>

   <li>Ability to define custom widgets cleanly, for example using
   XBL and APIs to query and control focus state, widget state, the
   position and state of input devices, etc.</li>

   <li>Rich text editing: an underlying architecture upon which
   domain-specific editors can be created, including things like
   control over the caret position.</li>

   <li>A predefined HTML editor based on the rich text editing
   architecture.</li>

   <li>Drag and drop APIs.</li>

   <li>Text selection manipulation APIs.</li>

   <li>Clipboard APIs (if the security and privacy concerns can be
   addressed).</li>

   <li>Flexible box model: The existing box model in CSS is designed
   largely for documents rather than user interface. We need a new
   box model designed for user interface which would relieve author
   complaints about other aspects of CSS and also reduce the need
   for tables for layout.</li>

   <li>Window-based state management (so that new windows don't
   interfere with existing sessions), for example implemented as a
   per-domain, per-window "file system". This would allow multiple
   instances of the same application (from the same site) to run
   without the instances overwriting each other's cookies.</li>

   <li>Markup to denote <span>mutually exclusive sections</span> (as
   in the commonly seen wizard interfaces).</li>

   <li>An improved CSS object model, for example with better APIs
   for animation, simpler ways to navigate the rendered content, a
   way to find the position of an element, methods to list the
   elements under a coordinate, etc.</li>

   <li>Better defined user authentication state handling. (Being able
   to "log out" of sites reliably, for instance, or being able to
   integrate the HTTP authentication model into the Web page.)</li>
