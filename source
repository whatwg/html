  <h3>Background</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML. HTML
  was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing
  scientific documents, although its general design and adaptations
  over the years has enabled it to be used to describe a number of
  other types of documents.</p>

  <p>The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a
  vague subject referred to as Web Applications. This specification
  attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the HTML
  specifications to address issues raised in the past few years.</p>


  <h3>Audience</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and
  scripts that use the features defined in this specificaton, and
  implementors of tools that are intended to conform to this
  specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness
  of documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of
  this specification.</p>

  <p>This document is probably not suited to readers who do not
  already have at least a passing familiarity with Web technologies,
  as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity for
  completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can
  provide a gentler introduction to the topic.</p>

  <p>In particular, readers should be familiar with the basics of DOM
  Core and DOM Events before reading this specification. An
  understanding of WebIDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode, character encodings,
  JavaScript, and CSS will be helpful in places but is not
  essential.</p>


  <h3>Scope</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level
  markup language and associated semantic-level scripting APIs for
  authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static documents
  to dynamic applications.</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification does not include providing
  mechanisms for media-specific customization of presentation
  (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at
  the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking
  into CSS are provided as part of the language).</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification does not include documenting
  every HTML or DOM feature supported by Web browsers. Browsers
  support many features that are considered to be very bad for
  accessibility or that are otherwise inappropriate. For example, the
  <code>blink</code> element is clearly presentational and authors
  wishing to cause text to blink should instead use CSS.</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire
  operating system. In particular, hardware configuration software,
  image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
  expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out
  of scope. In terms of applications, this specification is targeted
  specifically at applications that would be expected to be used by
  users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate
  locations, with low CPU requirements. For instance online purchasing
  systems, searching systems, games (especially multiplayer online
  games), public telephone books or address books, communications
  software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion
  software), document editing software, etc.</p>

  <p>For sophisticated cross-platform applications, there already
  exist several proprietary solutions (such as Mozilla's XUL, Adobe's
  Flash, or Microsoft's Silverlight). These solutions are evolving
  faster than any standards process could follow, and the requirements
  are evolving even faster. These systems are also significantly more
  complicated to specify, and are orders of magnitude more difficult
  to achieve interoperability with, than the solutions described in
  this document. Platform-specific solutions for such sophisticated
  applications (for example the Mac OS X Core APIs) are even further
  ahead.</p>


  <h3>History</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>Work on HTML5 originally started in late 2003, as a proof of
  concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML4's forms to
  provide many of the features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without
  requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that were
  incompatible with existing HTML Web pages. At this early stage,
  while the draft was already publicly available, and input was
  already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only
  under Opera Software's copyright.</p>

  <p>In early 2004, some of the principles that underlie this effort,
  as well as an early draft proposal covering just forms-related
  features, were presented to the W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera at
  a workshop discussing the future of Web Applications on the Web. The
  proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal conflicted
  with the previously chosen direction for the Web's evolution.</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced
  their intent to continue working on the effort. A public mailing
  list was created, and the drafts were moved to the WHATWG site. The
  copyright was subsequently amended to be jointly owned by all three
  vendors, and to allow reuse of the specifications.</p>

  <p>In 2006, the W3C expressed interest in the specification, and
  created a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the
  development of the HTML5 specifications. The working group opened in
  2007. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the
  specifications under the W3C copyright, while keeping versions with
  the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.</p>

  <p>Since then, both groups have been working together.</p>



  <h3>Relationships to other specifications</h3>

  <h4>Relationship to HTML 4.01 and DOM2 HTML</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification represents a new version of HTML4, along with
  a new version of the associated DOM2 HTML API. Migration from HTML4
  to the format and APIs described in this specification should in
  most cases be straightforward, as care has been taken to ensure that
  backwards-compatibility is retained. <a
  href="#refsHTML4">[HTML4]</a> <a
  href="#refsDOM2HTML">[DOM2HTML]</a></p>


  <h4>Relationship to XHTML 1.x</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification is intended to replace XHTML 1.0 as the
  normative definition of the XML serialization of the HTML
  vocabulary. <a href="#refsXHTML10">[XHTML10]</a></p>

  <p>While this specification updates the semantics and requirements
  of the vocabulary defined by XHTML Modularization 1.1 and used by
  XHTML 1.1, it does not attempt to provide a replacement for the
  modularization scheme defined and used by those (and other)
  specifications, and therefore cannot be considered a complete
  replacement for them. <a href="#refsXHTMLMOD">[XHTMLMOD]</a> <a
  href="#refsXHTML11">[XHTML11]</a></p>

  <p>Thus, authors and implementors who do not need such a
  modularization scheme can consider this specification a replacement
  for XHTML 1.x, but those who do need such a mechanism are encouraged
  to continue using the XHTML 1.1 line of specifications.</p>


  <h4>Relationship to XHTML2 and XForms</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>XHTML2 defines a new vocabulary with features for hyperlinks,
  multimedia content, annotating document edits, rich metadata,
  declarative interactive forms, and describing the semantics of human
  literary works such as poems and scientific papers. <a
  href="#refsXHTML2">[XHTML2]</a></p>

  <p>XForms similarly defines a new vocabulary with features for
  complex data entry, such as tax forms or insurance forms.</p>

  <p>However, XHTML2 and XForms lack features to express the semantics
  of many of the non-document types of content often seen on the
  Web. For instance, they are not well-suited for marking up forum
  sites, auction sites, search engines, online shops, mapping
  applications, e-mail applications, word processors, real-time
  strategy games, and the like.</p>

  <p><em>This</em> specification aims to extend HTML so that it is
  also suitable in these contexts.</p>

  <p>XHTML2, XForms, and this specification all use different
  namespaces and therefore can all be implemented in the same XML
  processor.</p>


  <h4>Relationship to Flash, Silverlight, XUL <!-- alphabetical -->
  and similar proprietary languages</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification is independent of the various proprietary
  application languages that various vendors provide, but is intended
  to address many of the same problems.</p>

  <p>In contrast with proprietary languages, this specification is
  intended to define an openly-produced, vendor-neutral language, to
  be implemented in a broad range of competing products, across a wide
  range of platforms and devices. This enables developers to write
  applications that are not limited to one vendor's implementation or
  language. Furthermore, while writing applications that target
  vendor-specific platforms necessarily introduces a cost that
  application developers and their customers or users will face if
  they are forced to switch (or desire to switch) to another vendor's
  platform, using an openly-produced and vendor neutral language means
  that application authors can switch vendors with little to no
  cost.</p>


  <h3>HTML vs XHTML</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification defines an abstract language for describing
  documents and applications, and some APIs for interacting with
  in-memory representations of resources that use this language.</p>

  <p>The in-memory representation is known as "DOM5 HTML", or "the
  DOM" for short.</p>

  <p>There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit
  resources that use this abstract language, two of which are defined
  in this specification.</p>

  <p>The first such concrete syntax is "HTML5". This is the format
  recommended for most authors. It is compatible with all legacy Web
  browsers. If a document is transmitted with the MIME type <code
  title="">text/html</code>, then it will be processed as an "HTML5"
  document by Web browsers.</p>

  <p>The second concrete syntax uses XML, and is known as
  "XHTML5". When a document is transmitted with an XML MIME type, such
  as <code title="">application/xhtml+xml</code>, then it is processed
  by an XML processor by Web browsers, and treated as an "XHTML5"
  document. Authors are reminded that the processing for XML and HTML
  differs; in particular, even minor syntax errors will prevent an XML
  document from being rendered fully, whereas they would be ignored in
  the "HTML5" syntax.</p>

  <p>The "DOM5 HTML", "HTML5", and "XHTML5" representations cannot all
  represent the same content. For example, namespaces cannot be
  represented using "HTML5", but they are supported in "DOM5 HTML" and
  "XHTML5". Similarly, documents that use the <code>noscript</code>
  feature can be represented using "HTML5", but cannot be represented
  with "XHTML5" and "DOM5 HTML". Comments that contain the string
  "<code title="">--&gt;</code>" can be represented in "DOM5 HTML" but
  not in "HTML5" and "XHTML5". And so forth.</p>


  <h3>Structure of this specification</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification is divided into the following major
  sections:</p>

  <dl>


   <dt><a href="#infrastructure">Common Infrastructure</a></dt>

   <dd>The conformance classes, algorithms, definitions, and the
   common underpinnings of the rest of the specification.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#dom">The DOM</a></dt>

   <dd>Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree
   using the DOM. This section defines the features of this DOM, as
   well as introducing the features common to all elements, and the
   concepts used in defining elements.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#semantics">Elements</a></dt>

   <dd>Each element has a predefined meaning, which is explained in
   this section. User agent requirements for how to handle each
   element are also given, along with rules for authors on how to use
   the element.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#browsers">Web Browsers</a></dt>

   <dd>HTML documents do not exist in a vacuum &mdash; this section
   defines many of the features that affect environments that deal
   with multiple pages, links between pages, and running scripts.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#editing">User Interaction</a></dt>

   <dd>HTML documents can provide a number of mechanisms for users to
   interact with and modify content, which are described in this
   section.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#comms">The Communication APIs</a></dt>

   <dd>Applications written in HTML often require mechanisms to
   communicate with remote servers, as well as communicating with
   other applications from different domains running on the same
   client.</dd>


   <dt><a href="#syntax">The Language Syntax</a></dt>

   <dd>All of these features would be for naught if they couldn't be
   represented in a serialized form and sent to other people, and so
   this section defines the syntax of HTML, along with rules for how
   to parse HTML.</dd>


  </dl>

  <p>There are also a couple of appendices, defining <a
  href="#rendering">rendering rules</a> for Web browsers and listing
  <a href="#no">areas that are out of scope</a> for this
  specification.</p>


  <h4>How to read this specification</h4>

  <p>This specification should be read like all other specifications.
  First, it should be read cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it
  should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be read by
  picking random sections from the contents list and following all the
  cross-references.</p>

  <h2 id="infrastructure">Common infrastructure</h2>

  <h3>Terminology</h3>

  <p>This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and DOM
  attributes, often in the same context. When it is not clear which is
  being referred to, they are referred to as <dfn>content
  attributes</dfn> for HTML and XML attributes, and <dfn>DOM
  attributes</dfn> for those from the DOM. Similarly, the term
  "properties" is used for both ECMAScript object properties and CSS
  properties. When these are ambiguous they are qualified as object
  properties and CSS properties respectively.</p>

  <p>The term <span>HTML documents</span> is sometimes used in
  contrast with <span>XML documents</span> to specifically mean
  documents that were parsed using an <span>HTML parser</span> (as
  opposed to using an <span>XML parser</span> or created purely
  through the DOM).</p>

  <p>Generally, when the specification states that a feature applies
  to HTML or XHTML, it also includes the other. When a feature
  specifically only applies to one of the two languages, it is called
  out by explicitly stating that it does not apply to the other
  format, as in "for HTML, ... (this does not apply to XHTML)".</p>

  <p>This specification uses the term <i>document</i> to
  refer to any use of HTML, ranging from short static documents to
  long essays or reports with rich multimedia, as well as to
  fully-fledged interactive applications.</p>

  <p>For simplicity, terms such as <i>shown</i>, <i>displayed</i>,
  and <i>visible</i> might sometimes be used when referring to the
  way a document is rendered to the user. These terms are not meant to
  imply a visual medium; they must be considered to apply to other
  media in equivalent ways.</p>

  <p>Some of the algorithms in this specification, for historical
  reasons, require the user agent to <dfn>pause</dfn> until some
  condition has been met. While a user agent is paused, it must ensure
  that no scripts execute (e.g. no event handlers, no timers,
  etc). User agents should remain responsive to user input while
  paused, however, albeit without letting the user interact with Web
  pages where that would involve invoking any <span title="concept-script">script</span>.</p>


  <h4>XML</h4>

  <p id="html-namespace">To ease migration from HTML to XHTML, UAs
  conforming to this specification will place elements in HTML in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace, at least for
  the purposes of the DOM and CSS. The term "<dfn>elements in the HTML
  namespace</dfn>", or "<dfn>HTML elements</dfn>" for short, when used
  in this specification, thus refers to both HTML and XHTML
  elements.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise stated, all elements defined or mentioned in
  this specification are in the
  <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace, and all
  attributes defined or mentioned in this specification have no
  namespace (they are in the per-element partition).</p>

  <p>When an XML name, such as an attribute or element name, is
  referred to in the form <code><var title="">prefix</var>:<var
  title="">localName</var></code>, as in <code>xml:id</code> or
  <code>svg:rect</code>, it refers to a name with the local name <var
  title="">localName</var> and the namespace given by the prefix, as
  defined by the following table:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><code title="">xml</code></dt>
   <dd><code>http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace</code></dd>
   <dt><code title="">html</code></dt>
   <dd><code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code></dd>
   <dt><code title="">svg</code></dt>
   <dd><code>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code></dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Attribute names are said to be <dfn>XML-compatible</dfn> if they
  match the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-Name"><code
  title="">Name</code></a> production defined in XML, they contain no
  U+003A COLON (:) characters, and their first three characters are
  not an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the string
  "<code title="">xml</code>". <a href="#refsXML">[XML]</a></p>


  <h4>DOM trees</h4>

  <p>The term <dfn>root element</dfn>, when not explicitly qualified
  as referring to the document's root element, means the furthest
  ancestor element node of whatever node is being discussed, or the
  node itself if it has no ancestors. When the node is a part of the
  document, then that is indeed the document's root element; however,
  if the node is not currently part of the document tree, the root
  element will be an orphaned node.</p>

  <p>A node's <dfn>home subtree</dfn> is the subtree rooted at that
  node's <span>root element</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code>Document</code> of a <code>Node</code> (such as an
  element) is the <code>Document</code> that the <code>Node</code>'s
  <code title="">ownerDocument</code> DOM attribute returns.</p>

  <p>An element is said to have been <dfn title="insert an element
  into a document">inserted into a document</dfn> when its <span>root
  element</span> changes and is now the document's <span>root
  element</span>. If a <code>Node</code> is in a <code>Document</code>
  then that <code>Document</code> is always the <code>Node</code>'s
  <code>Document</code>, and the <code>Node</code>'s <code
  title="">ownerDocument</code> DOM attribute thus always returns that
  <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>The term <dfn>tree order</dfn> means a pre-order, depth-first
  traversal of DOM nodes involved (through the <code
  title="">parentNode</code>/<code title="">childNodes</code>
  relationship).</p>

  <p>When it is stated that some element or attribute is <dfn
  title="ignore">ignored</dfn>, or treated as some other value, or
  handled as if it was something else, this refers only to the
  processing of the node after it is in the DOM. A user agent must not
  mutate the DOM in such situations.</p>

  <p>The term <dfn>text node</dfn> refers to any <code>Text</code>
  node, including <code>CDATASection</code> nodes; specifically, any
  <code>Node</code> with node type <code title="">TEXT_NODE</code> (3)
  or <code title="">CDATA_SECTION_NODE</code> (4). <a
  href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>


  <h4>Scripting</h4>

  <p>The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where
  <code>Foo</code> is actually an interface, is sometimes used instead
  of the more accurate "an object implementing the interface
  <code>Foo</code>".</p>

  <p>A DOM attribute is said to be <i>getting</i> when its value is
  being retrieved (e.g. by author script), and is said to be
  <i>setting</i> when a new value is assigned to it.</p>

  <p>If a DOM object is said to be <dfn>live</dfn>, then that means
  that any attributes returning that object must always return the
  same object (not a new object each time), and the attributes and
  methods on that object must operate on the actual underlying data,
  not a snapshot of the data.</p>

  <p>The terms <i>fire</i> and <i>dispatch</i> are used
  interchangeably in the context of events, as in the DOM Events
  specifications. <a href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>


  <h4>Plugins</h4>

  <p>The term <dfn>plugin</dfn> is used to mean any content handler,
  typically a third-party content handler, for Web content types that
  are not supported by the user agent natively, or for content types
  that do not expose a DOM, that supports rendering the content as
  part of the user agent's interface.</p>

  <p class="example">One example of a plugin would be a PDF viewer
  that is instantiated in a <span>browsing context</span> when the
  user navigates to a PDF file. This would count as a plugin
  regardless of whether the party that implemented the PDF viewer
  component was the same as that which implemented the user agent
  itself. However, a PDF viewer application that launches separate
  from the user agent (as opposed to using the same interface) is not
  a plugin by this definition.</p>

  <p class="note">This specification does not define a mechanism for
  interacting with plugins, as it is expected to be user-agent- and
  platform-specific. Some UAs might opt to support a plugin mechanism
  such as the Netscape Plugin API; others might use remote content
  converters or have built-in support for certain types. <a
  href="#refsNPAPI">[NPAPI]</a></p>

  <p class="warning">Browsers should take extreme care when
  interacting with external content intended for <span
  title="plugin">plugins</span>. When third-party software is run with
  the same privileges as the user agent itself, vulnerabilities in the
  third-party software become as dangerous as those in the user
  agent.</p>


  <h4>Character encodings</h4>

  <p>An <dfn>ASCII-compatible character encoding</dfn> is one that is
  a superset of US-ASCII (specifically, ANSI_X3.4-1968) for bytes in
  the set 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x20 - 0x22, 0x26, 0x27, 0x2C -
  0x3F, 0x41 - 0x5A, and 0x61 - 0x7A<!-- is that list ok? do any
  character sets we want to support do things outside that range?
  -->. <!-- XXX #refs RFC1345 ? --></p>




  <h3>Conformance requirements</h3>

  <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
  non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
  Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", <!--"SHALL", "SHALL
  NOT",--> "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be
  interpreted as described in RFC2119. For readability, these words do
  not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification. <a
  href="#refsRFC2119">[RFC2119]</a></p>

  <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms
  (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and
  abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
  key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the
  algorithm.</p>

  <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for user
  agents (relevant to implementors) and documents (relevant to
  authors and authoring tool implementors).</p>

  <p class="note">There is no implied relationship between document
  conformance requirements and implementation conformance
  requirements. User agents are not free to handle non-conformant
  documents as they please; the processing model described in this
  specification applies to implementations regardless of the
  conformity of the input documents.</p>



  <!-- put this list into its own section -->

  <p>User agents fall into several (overlapping) categories with
  different conformance requirements.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt id="interactive">Web browsers and other interactive user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Web browsers that support <span>XHTML</span> must process
    elements and attributes from the <span>HTML namespace</span> found
    in <span>XML documents</span> as described in this specification,
    so that users can interact with them, unless the semantics of
    those elements have been overridden by other specifications.</p>

    <p class="example">A conforming XHTML processor would, upon
    finding an XHTML <code>script</code> element in an XML document,
    execute the script contained in that element. However, if the
    element is found within a transformation expressed in XSLT
    (assuming the user agent also supports XSLT), then the processor
    would instead treat the <code>script</code> element as an opaque
    element that forms part of the transform.</p>

    <p>Web browsers that support <span title="HTML5">HTML</span> must
    process documents labeled as <code>text/html</code> as described
    in this specification, so that users can interact with them.</p>

    <p>User agents that support scripting must also be conforming
    implementations of the IDL fragments in this specification, as
    described in the WebIDL specification. <a
    href="#refsWebIDL">[WebIDL]</a></p>

   </dd>

   <dt id="non-interactive">Non-interactive presentation user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>User agents that process HTML and XHTML documents purely to
    render non-interactive versions of them must comply to the same
    conformance criteria as Web browsers, except that they are exempt
    from requirements regarding user interaction.</p>

    <p class="note">Typical examples of non-interactive presentation
    user agents are printers (static UAs) and overhead displays
    (dynamic UAs). It is expected that most static non-interactive
    presentation user agents will also opt to <a
    href="#non-scripted">lack scripting support</a>.</p>

    <p class="example">A non-interactive but dynamic presentation UA
    would still execute scripts, allowing forms to be dynamically
    submitted, and so forth. However, since the concept of "focus" is
    irrelevant when the user cannot interact with the document, the UA
    would not need to support any of the focus-related DOM APIs.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn id="non-scripted">User agents with no scripting support</dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Implementations that do not support scripting (or which have
    their scripting features disabled entirely) are exempt from
    supporting the events and DOM interfaces mentioned in this
    specification. For the parts of this specification that are
    defined in terms of an events model or in terms of the DOM, such
    user agents must still act as if events and the DOM were
    supported.</p>

    <p class="note">Scripting can form an integral part of an
    application. Web browsers that do not support scripting, or that
    have scripting disabled, might be unable to fully convey the
    author's intent.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Conformance checkers</dt>

   <dd id="conformance-checkers">

    <p>Conformance checkers must verify that a document conforms to
    the applicable conformance criteria described in this
    specification. Automated conformance checkers are exempt from
    detecting errors that require interpretation of the author's
    intent (for example, while a document is non-conforming if the
    content of a <code>blockquote</code> element is not a quote,
    conformance checkers running without the input of human judgement
    do not have to check that <code>blockquote</code> elements only
    contain quoted material).</p>

    <p>Conformance checkers must check that the input document
    conforms when parsed without a <span>browsing context</span>
    (meaning that no scripts are run, and that the parser's
    <span>scripting flag</span> is disabled), and should also check
    that the input document conforms when parsed with a <span>browsing
    context</span> in which scripts execute, and that the scripts
    never cause non-conforming states to occur other than transiently
    during script execution itself. (This is only a "SHOULD" and not a
    "MUST" requirement because it has been proven to be impossible. <a

    <p>The term "HTML5 validator" can be used to refer to a
    conformance checker that itself conforms to the applicable
    requirements of this specification.</p>

    <div class="note">

     <p>XML DTDs cannot express all the conformance requirements of
     this specification. Therefore, a validating XML processor and a
     DTD cannot constitute a conformance checker. Also, since neither
     of the two authoring formats defined in this specification are
     applications of SGML, a validating SGML system cannot constitute
     a conformance checker either.</p>

     <p>To put it another way, there are three types of conformance
     criteria:</p>

     <ol>

      <li>Criteria that can be expressed in a DTD.</li>

      <li>Criteria that cannot be expressed by a DTD, but can still be
      checked by a machine.</li>

      <li>Criteria that can only be checked by a human.</li>

     </ol>

     <p>A conformance checker must check for the first two. A simple
     DTD-based validator only checks for the first class of errors and
     is therefore not a conforming conformance checker according to
     this specification.</p>

    </div>
   </dd>

   <dt>Data mining tools</dt>

   <dd id="data-mining">

    <p>Applications and tools that process HTML and XHTML documents
    for reasons other than to either render the documents or check
    them for conformance should act in accordance to the semantics of
    the documents that they process.</p>

    <p class="example">A tool that generates <span
    title="outline">document outlines</span> but increases the nesting
    level for each paragraph and does not increase the nesting level
    for each section would not be conforming.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt id="editors">Authoring tools and markup generators</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Authoring tools and markup generators must generate conforming
    documents. Conformance criteria that apply to authors also apply
    to authoring tools, where appropriate.</p>

    <p>Authoring tools are exempt from the strict requirements of
    using elements only for their specified purpose, but only to the
    extent that authoring tools are not yet able to determine author
    intent.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, it is not conforming to use an
    <code>address</code> element for arbitrary contact information;
    that element can only be used for marking up contact information
    for the author of the document or section. However, since an
    authoring tool is likely unable to determine the difference, an
    authoring tool is exempt from that requirement.</p>

    <p class="note">In terms of conformance checking, an editor is
    therefore required to output documents that conform to the same
    extent that a conformance checker will verify.</p>

    <p>When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming
    document, it may preserve the conformance errors in sections of
    the document that were not edited during the editing session
    (i.e. an editing tool is allowed to round-trip erroneous
    content). However, an authoring tool must not claim that the
    output is conformant if errors have been so preserved.</p>

    <p>Authoring tools are expected to come in two broad varieties:
    tools that work from structure or semantic data, and tools that
    work on a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get media-specific editing
    basis (WYSIWYG).</p>

    <p>The former is the preferred mechanism for tools that author
    HTML, since the structure in the source information can be used to
    make informed choices regarding which HTML elements and attributes
    are most appropriate.</p>

    <p>However, WYSIWYG tools are legitimate. WYSIWYG tools should use
    elements they know are appropriate, and should not use elements
    that they do not know to be appropriate. This might in certain
    extreme cases mean limiting the use of flow elements to just a few
    elements, like <code>div</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>i</code>,
    and <code>span</code> and making liberal use of the <code
    title="attr-style">style</code> attribute.</p>

    <p>All authoring tools, whether WYSIWYG or not, should make a best
    effort attempt at enabling users to create well-structured,
    semantically rich, media-independent content.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on
  elements, attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements fall
  into two categories: those describing content model restrictions,
  and those describing implementation behavior. The former category
  of requirements are requirements on documents and authoring
  tools. The second category are requirements on user agents.</p>

  <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
  may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
  equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
  specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to
  be performant.)</p>

  <p id="hardwareLimitations">User agents may impose
  implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs,
  e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running
  out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.</p>

  <p>For compatibility with existing content and prior specifications,
  this specification describes two authoring formats: one based on XML
  (referred to as <dfn id="xhtml5" title="XHTML">XHTML5</dfn>), and
  one using a <a href="#parsing">custom format</a> inspired by SGML
  (referred to as <dfn id="html5">HTML5</dfn>). Implementations may
  support only one of these two formats, although supporting both is
  encouraged.</p>

  <p id="authors-using-xhtml"><span>XHTML</span> documents (<span>XML
  documents</span> using elements from the <span>HTML
  namespace</span>) that use the new features described in this
  specification and that are served over the wire (e.g. by HTTP) must
  be sent using an XML MIME type such as <code>application/xml</code>
  or <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> and must not be served as
  <code>text/html</code>. <a href="#refsRFC3023">[RFC3023]</a></p>

  <p id="entity-references">The language in this specification assumes
  that the user agent expands all entity references, and therefore
  does not include entity reference nodes in the DOM. If user agents
  do include entity reference nodes in the DOM, then user agents must
  handle them as if they were fully expanded when implementing this
  specification. For example, if a requirement talks about an
  element's child text nodes, then any text nodes that are children of
  an entity reference that is a child of that element would be used as
  well. Entity references to unknown entities must be treated as if
  they contained just an empty text node for the purposes of the
  algorithms defined in this specification.</p>


  <h4>Dependencies</h4>

  <p>This specification relies on several other underlying
  specifications.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>XML</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Implementations that support XHTML5 must support some version
    of XML, as well as its corresponding namespaces specification,
    because XHTML5 uses an XML serialization with namespaces. <a

    href="#refsXMLNAMES">[XMLNAMES]</a></p>

   </dd>

   <dt>DOM</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation &mdash; a
    model &mdash; of a document and its content. The DOM is not just
    an API; the conformance criteria of HTML implementations are
    defined, in this specification, in terms of operations on the DOM.
    <a href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>

    <p>Implementations must support some version of DOM Core and DOM
    Events, because this specification is defined in terms of the DOM,

  </dl>

  <p>This specification does not require support of any particular
  network transport protocols, style sheet language, scripting
  language, or any of the DOM and WebAPI specifications beyond those
  described above. However, the language described by this
  specification is biased towards CSS as the styling language,
  ECMAScript as the scripting language, and HTTP as the network
  protocol, and several features assume that those languages and
  protocols are in use.</p>

  <p class="note">This specification might have certain additional
  requirements on character encodings, image formats, audio formats,
  and video formats in the respective sections.</p>


  <h4>Features defined in other specifications</h4>

  <h3>Case-sensitivity and string comparison</h3>

  <p>This specification defines several comparison operators for
  strings.</p>

  <p>Comparing two strings in a <dfn>case-sensitive</dfn> manner means
  comparing them exactly, codepoint for codepoint.</p>

  <p>Comparing two strings in an <dfn>ASCII case-insensitive</dfn>
  manner means comparing them exactly, codepoint for codepoint, except
  that the characters in the range U+0041 .. U+005A (i.e. LATIN
  CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z) and the corresponding
  characters in the range U+0061 .. U+007A (i.e. LATIN SMALL LETTER A
  to LATIN SMALL LETTER Z) are considered to also match.</p>

  <p>Comparing two strings in a <dfn>compatibility caseless</dfn>
  manner means using the Unicode <i>compatibility caseless match</i>
  operation to compare the two strings. <a
  href="#refsUNICODECASE">[UNICODECASE]</a></p> <!-- XXX refs to
  Unicode Standard Annex #21, Case Mappings -->

  <p><dfn title="converted to uppercase">Converting a string to
  uppercase</dfn> means replacing all characters in the range U+0061
  .. U+007A (i.e. LATIN SMALL LETTER A to LATIN SMALL LETTER Z) with
  the corresponding characters in the range U+0041 .. U+005A
  (i.e. LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z).</p>

  <p><dfn title="converted to lowercase">Converting a string to
  lowercase</dfn> means replacing all characters in the range U+0041
  .. U+005A (i.e. LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z)
  with the corresponding characters in the range U+0061 .. U+007A
  (i.e. LATIN SMALL LETTER A to LATIN SMALL LETTER Z).</p>

  <p>A string <var title="">pattern</var> is a <dfn>prefix match</dfn>
  for a string <var title="">s</var> when <var title="">pattern</var>
  is not longer than <var title="">s</var> and truncating <var
  title="">s</var> to <var title="">pattern</var>'s length leaves the
  two strings as matches of each other.</p>



  <h3>Common microsyntaxes</h3>

  <p>There are various places in HTML that accept particular data
  types, such as dates or numbers. This section describes what the
  conformance criteria for content in those formats is, and how to
  parse them.</p>

  <!-- XXX need to define how to handle U+000A LINE FEED and U+000D
  CARRIAGE RETURN in attributes (for HTML) -->

  <p class="XXX">Need to go through the whole spec and make sure
  all the attribute values are clearly defined either in terms of
  microsyntaxes or in terms of other specs, or as "Text" or some
  such.</p>



  <h4>Common parser idioms</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="space character">space characters</dfn>, for the
  purposes of this specification, are U+0020 SPACE, U+0009 CHARACTER
  TABULATION (tab), U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000C FORM FEED (FF), and
  U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR).</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="White_Space">White_Space characters</dfn> are
  those that have the Unicode property "White_Space". <a
  href="#refsUNICODE">[UNICODE]</a></p>

  <p>Some of the micro-parsers described below follow the pattern of
  having an <var title="">input</var> variable that holds the string
  being parsed, and having a <var title="">position</var> variable
  pointing at the next character to parse in <var
  title="">input</var>.</p>

  <p>For parsers based on this pattern, a step that requires the user
  agent to <dfn>collect a sequence of characters</dfn> means that the
  following algorithm must be run, with <var title="">characters</var>
  being the set of characters that can be collected:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> and <var
   title="">position</var> be the same variables as those of the same
   name in the algorithm that invoked these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">result</var> be the empty string.</p></li>

   <li><p>While <var title="">position</var> doesn't point past the
   end of <var title="">input</var> and the character at <var
   title="">position</var> is one of the <var
   title="">characters</var>, append that character to the end of <var
   title="">result</var> and advance <var title="">position</var> to
   the next character in <var title="">input</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return <var title="">result</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The step <dfn>skip whitespace</dfn> means that the user agent
  must <span>collect a sequence of characters</span> that are <span
  title="space character">space characters</span>. The step <dfn>skip
  White_Space characters</dfn> means that the user agent must
  <span>collect a sequence of characters</span> that are
  <span>White_Space</span> characters. In both cases, the collected
  characters are not used. <a href="#refsUNICODE">[UNICODE]</a></p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>strip line breaks</dfn> from a
  string, the user agent must remove any U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and
  U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters from that string.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>codepoint length</dfn> of a string is the number of
  Unicode codepoints in that string.</p>



  <h4>Boolean attributes</h4>

  <p>A number of attributes in HTML5 are <dfn title="boolean
  attribute">boolean attributes</dfn>. The presence of a boolean
  attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence
  of the attribute represents the false value.</p>

  <p>If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty
  string or a value that is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span>
  match for the attribute's canonical name, with no leading or
  trailing whitespace.</p>

  <p class="note">The values "true" and "false" are not allowed on
  boolean attributes. To represent a false value, the attribute has to
  be omitted altogether.</p>


  <h4>Numbers</h4>

  <h5>Non-negative integers</h5>

  <p>A string is a <dfn>valid non-negative integer</dfn> if it
  consists of one of more characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO
  (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9).</p>

  <p>A <span>valid non-negative integer</span> represents the number
  that is represented in base ten by that string of digits.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>rules for parsing non-negative integers</dfn> are as
  given in the following algorithm. When invoked, the steps must be
  followed in the order given, aborting at the first step that returns
  a value. This algorithm will either return zero, a positive integer,
  or an error. Leading spaces are ignored. Trailing spaces and indeed
  any trailing garbage characters are ignored.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the string being
   parsed.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">position</var> be a pointer into <var
   title="">input</var>, initially pointing at the start of the
   string.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">value</var> have the value 0.</li>

   <li><p><span>Skip whitespace</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">position</var> is past the end of <var
   title="">input</var>, return an error.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the next character is a U+002B PLUS SIGN character (+),
   advance <var title="">position</var> to the next character.</li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">position</var> is past the end of <var
   title="">input</var>, return an error.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the next character is not one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0)
   .. U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9), then return an error.</p></li>

   <!-- Ok. At this point we know we have a number. It might have
   trailing garbage which we'll ignore, but it's a number, and we
   won't return an error. -->

   <li>

    <p>If the next character is one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) .. U+0039
    DIGIT NINE (9):</p>

    <ol>

     <li>Multiply <var title="">value</var> by ten.</li>

     <li>Add the value of the current character (0..9) to <var
     title="">value</var>.</li>

     <li>Advance <var title="">position</var> to the next
     character.</li>

     <li>If <var title="">position</var> is not past the end of <var
     title="">input</var>, return to the top of step 7 in the overall
     algorithm (that's the step within which these substeps find
     themselves).</li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var title="">value</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>


  <h5>Signed integers</h5>

  <p>A string is a <dfn>valid integer</dfn> if it consists of one of
  more characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to U+0039 DIGIT
  NINE (9), optionally prefixed with a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-")
  character.</p>

  <p>A <span>valid integer</span> without a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-")
  prefix represents the number that is represented in base ten by that
  string of digits. A <span>valid integer</span> <em>with</em> a
  U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-") prefix represents the number represented
  in base ten by the string of digits that follows the U+002D
  HYPHEN-MINUS, subtracted from zero.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>rules for parsing integers</dfn> are similar to the
  <span title="rules for parsing non-negative integers">rules for
  non-negative integers</span>, and are as given in the following
  algorithm. When invoked, the steps must be followed in the order
  given, aborting at the first step that returns a value. This
  algorithm will either return an integer or an error. Leading spaces
  are ignored. Trailing spaces and trailing garbage characters are
  ignored.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the string being

   string.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">value</var> have the value 0.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">sign</var> have the value
   "positive".</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">position</var> is past the end of <var
    title="">input</var>, return an error.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the character indicated by <var title="">position</var> (the

    <ol>

     <li>Let <var title="">sign</var> be "negative".</li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">sign</var> is "positive", return <var

  </ol>


  <h5>Real numbers</h5>

  <p>A string is a <dfn>valid floating point number</dfn> if it
  consists of:</p>

  <ol class="brief">

   <li>Optionally, a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-") character.</li>

   <li>A series of one or more characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT
   ZERO (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9).</li>

   <li>Optionally:

    <ol>

     <li>A single U+002E FULL STOP (".") character.</li>

     <li>A series of one or more characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT
     ZERO (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9).</li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>Optionally:

    <ol>

     <li>Either a U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E character or a U+0045
     LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E character.</li>

     <li>Optionally, a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-") character or U+002B
     PLUS SIGN ("+") character.</li>

     <li>A series of characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to
     U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9).</li>

    </ol>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>A <span>valid floating point number</span> represents the number
  obtained by multiplying the significand by ten raised to the power
  of the exponent, where the significand is the first number,
  interpreted as base ten (including the decimal point and the number
  after the decimal point, if any, and interpreting the significand as
  a negative number if the whole string starts with a U+002D
  HYPHEN-MINUS ("-") character and the number is not zero), and where
  the exponent is the number after the E, if any (interpreted as a
  negative number if there is a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-") character

  <h4>Dates and times</h4>

  <p>In the algorithms below, the <dfn>number of days in month <var
  title="">month</var> of year <var title="">year</var></dfn> is:
  <em>31</em> if <var title="">month</var> is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or
  12; <em>30</em> if <var title="">month</var> is 4, 6, 9, or 11;
  <em>29</em> if <var title="">month</var> is 2 and <var
  title="">year</var> is a number divisible by 400, or if <var
  title="">year</var> is a number divisible by 4 but not by 100; and
  <em>28</em> otherwise. This takes into account leap years in the
  Gregorian calendar. <a
  href="#refsGREGORIAN">[GREGORIAN]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-datetime-digit">digits</dfn> in the date
  and time syntaxes defined in this section must be characters in the
  range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE, used to express
  numbers in base ten.</p>


  <h5>Months</h5>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-month">month</dfn> consists of a specific
  proleptic Gregorian date with no timezone information and no date
  information beyond a year and a month. <a
  href="#refsGREGORIAN">[GREGORIAN]</a></p>

  <p>A string is a <dfn>valid month string</dfn> representing a year
  <var title="">year</var> and month <var title="">month</var> if it
  consists of the following components in the given order:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Four or more <span
   title="concept-datetime-digit">digits</span>, representing <var
   title="">year</var>, where <var
   title="">year</var>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0</li>

   <li>A U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-)</li>

   <li>Two <span title="concept-datetime-digit">digits</span>,
   representing the month <var title="">month</var>, in the range
   1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var
   title="">month</var>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;12</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The rules to <dfn>parse a month string</dfn> are as follows. This
  will either return a year and month, or nothing. If at any point the
  algorithm says that it "fails", this means that it is aborted at
  that point and returns nothing.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the string being

  </ol>

  <p>The rules to <dfn>parse a month component</dfn>, given an <var

  <p>A string is a <dfn>valid global date and time string</dfn>
  representing a date, time, and a timezone offset if it consists of
  the following components in the given order:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>A <span>valid date string</span> representing the date</li>

   <li>A U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character</li>

   <li>A <span>valid time string</span> representing the time</li>

   <li>Either:

    <ul>

     <li>A U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z character, allowed only if
     the time zone is UTC</li>

     <li>Or:

      <ol>

       <li>Either a U+002B PLUS SIGN character (+) or a U+002D
       HYPHEN-MINUS (-) character, representing the sign of the
       timezone offset</li>

       <li>Two <span title="concept-datetime-digit">digits</span>,

  <p class="note">This format allows for time zone offsets from -23:59

  -12:00 to +14:00, and the minutes component of actual time zones is
  always either 00, 30, or 45.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following are some examples of dates written as <span
   title="valid global date and time string">valid global date and
   time strings</span>.</p>

   <dl>

    <dt>"<code>0037-12-13T00:00Z</code>"</dt>

    <dd>Midnight UTC on the birthday of Nero (the Roman Emperor).</dd>

    <dt>"<code>1979-10-14T12:00:00.001-04:00</code>"</dt>

    <dd>One millisecond after noon on October 14th 1979, in the time
    zone in use on the east coast of North America during daylight
    saving time.</dd>

    <dt>"<code>8592-01-01T02:09+02:09</code>"</dt>

    <dd>Midnight UTC on the 1st of January, 8592. The time zone
    associated with that time is two hours and nine minutes ahead of
    UTC, which is not a real time zone currently, but is nonetheless
    allowed.</dd>

   </dl>

   <p>Several things are notable about these dates:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>Years with fewer than four digits have to be
    zero-padded. The date "37-12-13" would not be a valid date.</li>

    <li>To unambiguously identify a moment in time prior to the
    introduction of the Gregorian calendar, the date has to be first
    converted to the Gregorian calendar from the calendar in use at
    the time (e.g. from the Julian calendar). The date of Nero's birth
    is the 15th of December 37, in the Julian Calendar, which is the
    13th of December 37 in the proleptic Gregorian Calendar.</li> <!--
    XXX this might not be true. I can't find a reference that gives
    his birthday with an explicit statement about the calendar being
    used. However, it seems unlikely that it would be given in the
    Gregorian calendar, so I assume sites use the Julian one. -->

    <li>The time and timezone components are not optional.</li>

    <li>Dates before the year zero can't be represented as a datetime
    in this version of HTML.</li>

    <li>Time zones differ based on daylight savings time.</li>

  <h5>Weeks</h5>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-week">week</dfn> consists of a week-year
  number and a week number representing a seven day period. Each
  week-year in this calendaring system has either 52 weeks or 53

  starting on the Gregorian date Monday December 29th 1969
  (1969-12-29) is defined as week number 1 in week-year
  1970. Consecutive weeks are numbered sequentially. The week before
  the number 1 week in a week-year is the last week in the previous
  week-year, and vice versa. <a

  1st), and a week-year <var title="">year</var> where <var
  title="">year</var> is a number divisible by 400, or a number
  divisible by 4 but not by 100, has 53 weeks. All other week-years
  have 52 weeks.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>week number of the last day</dfn> of a week-year with 53

  <h4>Space-separated tokens</h4>

  <p>A <dfn>set of space-separated tokens</dfn> is a set of zero or
  more words separated by one or more <span title="space
  character">space characters</span>, where words consist of any
  string of one or more characters, none of which are <span
  title="space character">space characters</span>.</p>

  <p>A string containing a <span>set of space-separated tokens</span>

  <p>An <dfn>unordered set of unique space-separated tokens</dfn> is a
  <span>set of space-separated tokens</span> where none of the words
  are duplicated.</p>

  <p>An <dfn>ordered set of unique space-separated tokens</dfn> is a
  <span>set of space-separated tokens</span> where none of the words
  are duplicated but where the order of the tokens is meaningful.</p>

  <p><span title="set of space-separated tokens">Sets of
  space-separated tokens</span> sometimes have a defined set of
  allowed values. When a set of allowed values is defined, the tokens
  must all be from that list of allowed values; other values are
  non-conforming. If no such set of allowed values is provided, then
  all values are conforming.</p>

  <p>When a user agent has to <dfn>split a string on spaces</dfn>, it

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the string being
   parsed.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">position</var> be a pointer into <var

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var title="">tokens</var>.</p></li>  

  </ol>

  <p>When a user agent has to <dfn>remove a token from a string</dfn>,
  it must use the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the string being
   modified.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">token</var> be the token being removed. It

   <li><p>If <var title="">position</var> is beyond the end of <var

    <ol>

     <li><p>Append the character at <var title="">position</var> to

     <li><p>Return to step 5 in the overall set of steps.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, the character at <var title="">position</var> is

  <p class="note">This causes any occurrences of the token to be

  <h4>Comma-separated tokens</h4>

  <p>A <dfn>set of comma-separated tokens</dfn> is a set of zero or
  more tokens each separated from the next by a single U+002C COMMA
  character (<code title="">,</code>), where tokens consist of any
  string of zero or more characters, neither beginning nor ending with
  <span title="space character">space characters</span>, nor
  containing any U+002C COMMA characters (<code title="">,</code>),
  and optionally surrounded by <span title="space character">space
  characters</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">For instance, the string "<code
  title="">&nbsp;a&nbsp;,b,,d&nbsp;d&nbsp;</code>" consists of four
  tokens: "a", "b", the empty string, and "d&nbsp;d". Leading and
  trailing whitespace around each token doesn't count as part of the
  token, and the empty string can be a token.</p>

  <p><span title="set of comma-separated tokens">Sets of
  comma-separated tokens</span> sometimes have further restrictions on
  what consists a valid token. When such restrictions are defined, the
  tokens must all fit within those restrictions; other values are
  non-conforming. If no such restrictions are specified, then all
  values are conforming.</p>

  <p>When a user agent has to <dfn>split a string on commas</dfn>, it
  must use the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the string being
   parsed.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">position</var> be a pointer into <var
   title="">input</var>, initially pointing at the start of the

  <h4>Keywords and enumerated attributes</h4>

  <p>Some attributes are defined as taking one of a finite set of
  keywords. Such attributes are called <dfn title="enumerated
  attribute">enumerated attributes</dfn>. The keywords are each
  defined to map to a particular <em>state</em> (several keywords
  might map to the same state, in which case some of the keywords are
  synonyms of each other; additionally, some of the keywords can be
  said to be non-conforming, and are only in the specification for
  historical reasons). In addition, two default states can be
  given. The first is the <i>invalid value default</i>, the second
  is the <i>missing value default</i>.</p>

  <p>If an enumerated attribute is specified, the attribute's value
  must be an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for one of the
  given keywords that are not said to be non-conforming, with no
  leading or trailing whitespace.</p>

  <p>When the attribute is specified, if its value is an <span>ASCII
  case-insensitively</span> match for one of the given keywords then
  that keyword's state is the state that the attribute represents. If
  the attribute value matches none of the given keywords, but the
  attribute has an <i>invalid value default</i>, then the attribute
  represents that state. Otherwise, if the attribute value matches
  none of the keywords but there is a <i>missing value default</i>
  state defined, then <em>that</em> is the state represented by the
  attribute. Otherwise, there is no default, and invalid values must
  be ignored.</p>

  <p>When the attribute is <em>not</em> specified, if there is a
  <i>missing value default</i> state defined, then that is the state
  represented by the (missing) attribute. Otherwise, the absence of
  the attribute means that there is no state represented.</p>

  <p class="note">The empty string can be one of the keywords in some
  cases. For example the <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute has
  two states: <i>true</i>, matching the <code title="">true</code>
  keyword and the empty string, <i>false</i>, matching <code
  title="">false</code> and all other keywords (it's the <i>invalid
  value default</i>). It could further be thought of as having a
  third state <i>inherit</i>, which would be the default when the
  attribute is not specified at all (the <i>missing value
  default</i>), but for various reasons that isn't the way this
  specification actually defines it.</p>


  <h4 id="syntax-references">References</h4>

  <p>A <dfn>valid hash-name reference</dfn> to an element of type <var
  title="">type</var> is a string consisting of a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN
  (<code title="">#</code>) character followed by a string which
  exactly matches the value of the <code title="">name</code>
  attribute of an element in the document with type <var
  title="">type</var>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>rules for parsing a hash-name reference</dfn> to an
  element of type <var title="">type</var> are as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the string being parsed does not contain a U+0023 NUMBER
   SIGN character, or if the first such character in the string is the
   last character in the string, then return null and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">s</var> be the string from the character
   immediately after the first U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character in the
   string being parsed up to the end of that string.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return the first element of type <var title="">type</var>
   that has an <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute whose value
   is a <span>case-sensitive</span> match for <var title="">s</var> or
   a <code title="">name</code> attribute whose value is a
   <span>compatibility caseless</span> match for <var
   title="">s</var>.</p></li>

  <h3>URLs</h3>

  <p>This specification defines the term <span>URL</span>, and defines
  various algorithms for dealing with URLs, because for historical
  reasons the rules defined by the URI and IRI specifications are not
  a complete description of what HTML user agents need to implement to
  be compatible with Web content.</p>


  <h4>Terminology</h4>

  <p>A <dfn>URL</dfn> is a string used to identify a resource.</p>

  <p>A <span>URL</span> is a <dfn>valid URL</dfn> if at least one of
  the following conditions holds:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><p>The <span>URL</span> is a valid URI reference <a
   href="#refsRFC3986">[RFC3986]</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <span>URL</span> is a valid IRI reference and it has no
   query component. <a href="#refsRFC3987">[RFC3987]</a></p></li>

   <li><p>The <span>URL</span> is a valid IRI reference and its query
   component contains no unescaped non-ASCII characters. <a
   href="#refsRFC3987">[RFC3987]</a></p></li>

   <li><p>The <span>URL</span> is a valid IRI reference and the <span
   title="document's character encoding">character encoding</span> of
   the URL's <code>Document</code> is UTF-8 or UTF-16. <a
   href="#refsRFC3987">[RFC3987]</a></p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>A <span>URL</span> has an associated <dfn>URL character
  encoding</dfn>, determined as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the URL came from a script (e.g. as an argument to a
   method)</dt>

   <dd>The URL character encoding is the <span>script's character
   encoding</span>.</dd>

   <dt>If the URL came from a DOM node (e.g. from an element)</dt>

   <dd>The node has a <code>Document</code>, and the URL character
   encoding is the <span>document's character encoding</span>.</dd>

   <dt>If the URL had a character encoding defined when the URL was
   created or defined</dt>

   <dd>The URL character encoding is as defined.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="note">The term "URL" in this specification is used in a
  manner distinct from the precise technical meaning it is given in
  RFC 3986. Readers familiar with that RFC will find it easier to read
  <em>this</em> specification if they pretend the term "URL" as used
  herein is really called something else altogether.</p>


  <h4>Parsing URLs</h4>

  <p>To <dfn>parse a URL</dfn> <var title="">url</var> into its
  component parts, the user agent must use the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Strip leading and trailing <span title="space
   character">space characters</span> from <var
   title="">url</var>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Parse <var title="">url</var> in the manner defined by RFC
    3986, with the following exceptions:</p>

    <ul>

     <li>Add all characters with codepoints less than or equal to
     U+0020 or greater than or equal to U+007F to the
     &lt;unreserved&gt; production.</li>

     <li>Add the characters U+0022, U+003C, U+003E, U+005B .. U+005E,
     U+0060, and U+007B .. U+007D to the &lt;unreserved&gt;
     production.
      <!--
       0022 QUOTATION MARK
       003C LESS-THAN SIGN
       003E GREATER-THAN SIGN
       005B LEFT SQUARE BRACKET
       005C REVERSE SOLIDUS
       005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET
       005E CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT
       0060 GRAVE ACCENT
       007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET
       007C VERTICAL LINE
       007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET
      -->
     </li>

     <li>Add a single U+0025 PERCENT SIGN character as a second
     alternative way of matching the &lt;pct-encoded&gt; production,
     except when the &lt;pct-encoded&gt; is used in the
     &lt;reg-name&gt; production.</li>

     <li>Add the U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character to the characters
     allowed in the &lt;fragment&gt; production.</li>

     <!-- some browsers also have other differences, e.g. Mozilla
     seems to treat ";" as if it was not in sub-delims, if the scheem
     is "ftp". -->

    </ul>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">url</var> doesn't match the
    &lt;URI-reference&gt; production, even after the above changes are
    made to the ABNF definitions, then parsing the URL fails with an
    error. <a href="#refsRFC3986">[RFC3986]</a></p>

    <p>Otherwise, parsing <var title="">url</var> was successful; the
    components of the URL are substrings of <var title="">url</var>
    defined as follows:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt><dfn title="url-scheme">&lt;scheme&gt;</dfn></dt>

     <dd><p>The substring matched by the &lt;scheme&gt; production, if any.</p></dd>


     <dt><dfn title="url-host">&lt;host&gt;</dfn></dt>

     <dd><p>The substring matched by the &lt;host&gt; production, if any.</p></dd>


     <dt><dfn title="url-port">&lt;port&gt;</dfn></dt>

     <dd><p>The substring matched by the &lt;port&gt; production, if any.</p></dd>


     <dt><dfn title="url-hostport">&lt;hostport&gt;</dfn></dt>

     <dd><p>If there is a &lt;scheme&gt; component and a &lt;port&gt;
     component and the port given by the &lt;port&gt; component is
     different than the default port defined for the protocol given by
     the &lt;scheme&gt; component, then &lt;hostport&gt; is the
     substring that starts with the substring matched by the
     &lt;host&gt; production and ends with the substring matched by the
     &lt;port&gt; production, and includes the colon in between the
     two. Otherwise, it is the same as the &lt;host&gt; component.</p>


     <dt><dfn title="url-path">&lt;path&gt;</dfn></dt>

     <dd>

      <p>The substring matched by one of the following productions, if
      one of them was matched:</p>

      <ul class="brief">
       <li>&lt;path-abempty&gt;</li>
       <li>&lt;path-absolute&gt;</li>
       <li>&lt;path-noscheme&gt;</li>
       <li>&lt;path-rootless&gt;</li>
       <li>&lt;path-empty&gt;</li>
      </ul>

     </dd>


     <dt><dfn title="url-query">&lt;query&gt;</dfn></dt>

     <dd><p>The substring matched by the &lt;query&gt; production, if any.</p></dd>


     <dt><dfn title="url-fragment">&lt;fragment&gt;</dfn></dt>

     <dd><p>The substring matched by the &lt;fragment&gt; production, if any.</p></dd>


     <dt><dfn title="url-host-specific">&lt;host-specific&gt;</dfn></dt>

     <dd><p>The substring that <em>follows</em> the substring matched
     by the &lt;authority&gt; production, or the whole string if the
     &lt;authority&gt; production wasn't matched.</p></dd>

    </dl>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <!-- XXX we might want to define "server-based naming authority",
  it's not clear RFC3986 does a good job of defining that anymore
  (earlier URI specs did) -->



  <h4>Resolving URLs</h4>

  <p>To <dfn>resolve a URL</dfn> to an <span>absolute URL</span>
  relative to either another <span>absolute URL</span> or an element,
  the user agent must use the following steps. Resolving a URL can
  result in an error, in which case the URL is not resolvable.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">url</var> be the <span>URL</span> being
   resolved.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">encoding</var> be the <span>URL character
   encoding</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">encoding</var> is UTF-16, then change it to
   UTF-8.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the algorithm was invoked with an <span>absolute URL</span>
    to use as the base URL, let <var title="">base</var> be that
    <span>absolute URL</span>.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, let <var title="">base</var> be the <i>base URI of
    the element</i>, as defined by the XML Base specification, with
    <i>the base URI of the document entity</i> being defined as the
    <span>document base URL</span> of the <code>Document</code> that
    owns the element. <a href="#refsXMLBASE">[XMLBASE]</a></p>

    <p>For the purposes of the XML Base specification, user agents
    must act as if all <code>Document</code> objects represented XML
    documents.</p>

    <p class="note">It is possible for <code
    title="attr-xml-base">xml:base</code> attributes to be present
    even in HTML fragments, as such attributes can be added
    dynamically using script. (Such scripts would not be conforming,
    however, as <code title="attr-xml-base">xml:base</code> attributes
    are not allowed in <span>HTML documents</span>.)</p>

    <p>The <dfn>document base URL</dfn> of a <code>Document</code> is
    the <span>absolute URL</span> obtained by running these
    substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var title="">fallback base url</var> be <span>the
     document's address</span>.</p></li>

     <li>

      <!-- http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/navigation/javascript-url/ -->

      <!-- XXX this should be tested in the case of a browsing context
      that was navigated to about:blank after having been elsewhere,
      as opposed to the about:blank used at the time of the browsing
      context's creation. -->

      <p>If <var title="">fallback base url</var> is
      <code>about:blank</code>, and the <code>Document</code>'s
      <span>browsing context</span> has a <span>creator browsing
      context</span>, then let <var title="">fallback base url</var>
      be the <span>document base URL</span> of the <span>creator
      <code>Document</code></span> instead.</p>

     </li>

     <li><p>If there is no <code>base</code> element that is both a
     child of <span>the <code>head</code> element</span> and has an
     <code title="attr-base-href">href</code> attribute, then the
     <span>document base URL</span> is <var title="">fallback base
     url</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, let <var title="">url</var> be the value of the
     <code title="attr-base-href">href</code> attribute of the first
     such element.</p></li>

     <li><p><span title="resolve a URL">Resolve</span> <var
     title="">url</var> relative to <var title="">fallback base
     url</var> (thus, the <code>base</code> <code
     title="attr-base-href">href</code> attribute isn't affected by
     <code title="attr-xml-base">xml:base</code> attributes).</p></li>

     <li><p>The <span>document base URL</span> is the result of the
     previous step if it was successful; otherwise it is <var
     title="">fallback base url</var>.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p><span title="parse a URL">Parse</span> <var
   title="">url</var> into its component parts.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If parsing <var title="">url</var> resulted in a <span
    title="url-host">&lt;host&gt;</span> component, then replace the
    matching subtring of <var title="">url</var> with the string that
    results from expanding any sequences of percent-encoded octets in
    that component that are valid UTF-8 sequences into Unicode
    characters as defined by UTF-8.</p>

    <p>If any percent-encoded octets in that component are not valid
    UTF-8 sequences, then return an error and abort these steps.</p>

    <p>Apply the IDNA ToASCII algorithm to the matching substring,
    with both the AllowUnassigned and UseSTD3ASCIIRules flags
    set. Replace the matching substring with the result of the ToASCII
    algorithm.</p>

    <p>If ToASCII fails to convert one of the components of the
    string, e.g. because it is too long or because it contains invalid
    characters, then return an error and abort these steps. <a
    href="#refsRFC3490">[RFC3490]</a></p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If parsing <var title="">url</var> resulted in a <span
    title="url-path">&lt;path&gt;</span> component, then replace the
    matching substring of <var title="">url</var> with the string that
    results from applying the following steps to each character other
    than U+0025 PERCENT SIGN (%) that doesn't match the original
    &lt;path&gt; production defined in RFC 3986:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>Encode the character into a sequence of octets as defined by
     UTF-8.</li>

     <li>Replace the character with the percent-encoded form of those
     octets. <a href="#refsRFC3986">[RFC3986]</a></li>

    </ol>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For instance if <var title="">url</var> was "<code
     title="">//example.com/a^b&#x263a;c%FFd%z/?e</code>", then the
     <span title="url-path">&lt;path&gt;</span> component's substring
     would be "<code title="">/a^b&#x263a;c%FFd%z/</code>" and the two
     characters that would have to be escaped would be "<code
     title="">^</code>" and "<code title="">&#x263a;</code>". The
     result after this step was applied would therefore be that <var
     title="">url</var> now had the value "<code
     title="">//example.com/a%5Eb%E2%98%BAc%FFd%z/?e</code>".</p>

    </div>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If parsing <var title="">url</var> resulted in a <span
    title="url-query">&lt;query&gt;</span> component, then replace the
    matching substring of <var title="">url</var> with the string that
    results from applying the following steps to each character other
    than U+0025 PERCENT SIGN (%) that doesn't match the original
    &lt;query&gt; production defined in RFC 3986:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>If the character in question cannot be expressed in the
     encoding <var title="">encoding</var>, then replace it with a
     single 0x3F octet (an ASCII question mark) and skip the remaining
     substeps for this character.</li>

     <li>Encode the character into a sequence of octets as defined by
     the encoding <var title="">encoding</var>.</li>

     <li>Replace the character with the percent-encoded form of those
     octets. <a href="#refsRFC3986">[RFC3986]</a></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Apply the algorithm described in RFC 3986 section 5.2
   Relative Resolution, using <var title="">url</var> as the
   potentially relative URI reference (<var title="">R</var>), and
   <var title="">base</var> as the base URI (<var

  <h4>Dynamic changes to base URLs</h4>

  <p>When an <code title="attr-xml-base">xml:base</code> attribute
  changes, the attribute's element, and all descendant elements, are
  <span>affected by a base URL change</span>.</p>

  <p>When a document's <span>document base URL</span> changes, all
  elements in that document are <span>affected by a base URL
  change</span>.</p>

  <p>When an element is moved from one document to another, if the two
  documents have different <span title="document base URL">base
  URLs</span>, then that element and all its descendants are
  <span>affected by a base URL change</span>.</p>

  <p>When an element is <dfn>affected by a base URL change</dfn>, it
  must act as described in the following list:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the element is a <span title="hyperlink">hyperlink
   element</span></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If the <span>absolute URL</span> identified by the hyperlink is
    being shown to the user, or if any data derived from that URL is
    affecting the display, then the <code
    title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute should be <span
    title="resolve a url">reresolved</span> relative to the element
    and the UI updated appropriately.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, the CSS <code
    title="selector-link">:link</code>/<code
    title="selector-visited">:visited</code> pseudo-classes might have
    been affected.</p>

    <p>If the hyperlink has a <code
    title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute and its <span
    title="absolute URL">absolute URL(s)</span> are being shown to the
    user, then the <code title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code>
    attribute's tokens should be <span title="resolve a

    appropriately.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>If the element is a <code>blockquote</code>, <code>q</code>,
   <code>ins</code>, or <code>del</code> element with a <code

   <dd>

    <p>If the <span>absolute URL</span> identified by the <code

    appropriately.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Otherwise</dt>

    <p>The element is not directly affected.</p>

  <h4>Interfaces for URL manipulation</h4>

 <p>An interface that has a complement of <dfn>URL decomposition
  attributes</dfn> will have seven attributes with the following
  definitions:</p>

<pre class="idl">
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-uda-protocol">protocol</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-uda-host">host</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-uda-hostname">hostname</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-uda-port">port</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-uda-pathname">pathname</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-uda-search">search</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-uda-hash">hash</span>;
</pre>

  <p>The attributes defined to be URL decomposition attributes must
  act as described for the attributes with the same corresponding
  names in this section.</p>

  <p>In addition, an interface with a complement of URL decomposition
  attributes will define an <dfn
  title="concept-uda-input">input</dfn>, which is a <span>URL</span>
  that the attributes act on, and a <dfn
  title="concept-uda-setter">common setter action</dfn>, which is a
  set of steps invoked when any of the attributes' setters are
  invoked.</p>

  <p>The seven URL decomposition attributes have similar
  requirements.</p>

  <p>On getting, if the <span title="concept-uda-input">input</span>
  fulfills the condition given in the "getter condition" column
  corresponding to the attribute in the table below, the user agent
  must return the part of the <span
  title="concept-uda-input">input</span> URL given in the "component"
  column, with any prefixes specified in the "prefix" column
  appropriately added to the start of the string and any suffixes
  specified in the "suffix" column appropriately added to the end of
  the string. Otherwise, the attribute must return the empty
  string.</p>

  <p>On setting, the new value must first be mutated as described by
  the "setter preprocessor" column, then mutated by %-escaping any
  characters in the new value that are not valid in the relevant
  component as given by the "component" column. Then, if the resulting
  new value fulfills the condition given in the "setter condition"
  column, the user agent must make a new string <var
  title="">output</var> by replacing the component of the URL given by
  the "component" column in the <span
  title="concept-uda-input">input</span> URL with the new value;
  otherwise, the user agent must let <var title="">output</var> be
  equal to the <span title="concept-uda-input">input</span>. Finally,
  the user agent must invoke the <span
  title="concept-uda-setter">common setter action</span> with the
  value of <var title="">output</var>.</p>

  <p>When replacing a component in the URL, if the component is part
  of an optional group in the URL syntax consisting of a character
  followed by the component, the component (including its prefix
  character) must be included even if the new value is the empty
  string.</p>

  <p class="note">The previous paragraph applies in particular to the
  "<code title="">:</code>" before a &lt;port> component, the "<code
  title="">?</code>" before a &lt;query> component, and the "<code
  title="">#</code>" before a &lt;fragment> component.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of the above definitions, URLs must be parsed
  using the <span title="parse a URL">URL parsing rules</span> defined
  in this specification.</p>

  <h3>Fetching resources</h3>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>fetch</dfn> a resource, the
  following steps must be run:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the resource is identified by the <span>URL</span>
   <dfn><code>about:blank</code></dfn>, then return the empty string
   and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Perform the remaining steps asynchronously.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the resource is identified by an <span>absolute URL</span>,
    and the resource is to be obtained using a idempotent action (such
    as an HTTP GET <span title="concept-http-equivalent-get">or
    equivalent</span>), and it is already being downloaded for other
    reasons (e.g. another invocation of this algorithm), and the user
    agent is configured such that it is to reuse the data from the
    existing download instead of initiating a new one, then use the
    results of the existing download instead of starting a new
    one.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, at a time convenient to the user and the user agent,
    download (or otherwise obtain) the resource, applying the
    semantics of the relevant specifications (e.g. performing an HTTP
    GET or POST operation, or reading the file from disk, following
    redirects, <span title="concept-js-deref">dereferencing <span
    title="javascript protocol"><code title="">javascript:</code>
    URLs</span></span>, etc).</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>When the resource is available, <span>queue a task</span>
   that uses the resource as appropriate. If the resource can be
   processed incrementally, as, for instance, with a progressively
   interlaced JPEG or an HTML file, multiple tasks may be queued to
   process the data as it is downloaded. The <span>task source</span>
   for these tasks is the <span>networking task source</span>.</p>
   <!-- XXX make sure each use of 'fetch' defines what the appropriate
   task is -->

  </ol>

  <p class="note">The <span>offline application cache</span>
  processing model introduces some <a
  href="#changesToNetworkingModel">changes to the networking model</a>
  to handle the returning of cached resources.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span title="navigate">navigation</span>
  processing model handles redirects itself, overriding the
  redirection handling that would be done by the fetching
  algorithm.</p>

  <p class="note">Whether the <a href="#content-type-sniffing">type
  sniffing rules</a> apply to the fetched resource depends on the
  algorithm that invokes the rules &mdash; they are not always
  applicable.</p>


  <h4 id="concept-http-equivalent">Protocol concepts</h4>

  <p>User agents can implement a variety of transfer protocols, but
  this specification mostly defines behavior in terms of HTTP. <a
  href="#refsHTTP">[HTTP]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-http-equivalent-get">HTTP GET
  method</dfn> is equivalent to the default retrieval action of the
  protocol. For example, RETR in FTP. Such actions are idempotent and
  safe, in HTTP terms.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-http-equivalent-codes">HTTP response
  codes</dfn> are equivalent to statuses in other protocols that have
  the same basic meanings. For example, a "file not found" error is
  equivalent to a 404 code, a server error is equivalent to a 5xx
  code, and so on.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-http-equivalent-headers">HTTP
  headers</dfn> are equivalent to fields in other protocols that have
  the same basic meaning. For example, the the HTTP authentication
  headers are equivalent to the authentication aspects of the FTP
  protocol.</p>

  <p class="XXX">If there are any specific questions with what should
  be considered equivalent to what, let me know, and I'll make it more
  explicit for those cases.</p>


  <h4>Encrypted HTTP and related security concerns</h4>

  <p>Anything in this specification that refers to HTTP also applies
  to HTTP-over-TLS, as represented by <span title="url">URLs</span>
  representing the <code title="">https</code> scheme.</p>

  <p class="warning">User agents should report certificate errors to
  the user and must either refuse to download resources sent with
  erroneous certificates or must act as if such resources were in fact
  served with no encryption.</p>

  <p>Not doing so can result in users not noticing man-in-the-middle
  attacks.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>If a user connects to a server with a self-signed certificate,
   the user agent could allow the connection but just act as if there
   had been no encryption. If the user agent instead allowed the user
   to override the problem and then displayed the page as if it was
   fully and safely encrypted, the user could be easily tricked into
   accepting man-in-the-middle connections.</p>

   <p>If a user connects to a server with full encryption, but the
   page then refers to an external resource that has an expired
   certificate, then the user agent will act as if the resource was
   unavailable, possibly also reporting the problem to the user. If
   the user agent instead allowed the resource to be used, then an
   attacker could just look for "secure" sites that used resources
   from a different host and only apply man-in-the-middle attacks to
   that host, for example taking over scripts in the page.</p>

  </div>



  <h3 id="content-type-sniffing">Determining the type of a resource</h3>

  <p class="warning">It is imperative that the rules in this section
  be followed exactly. When a user agent uses different heuristics for
  content type detection than the server expects, security problems
  can occur. For example, if a server believes that the client will
  treat a contributed file as an image (and thus treat it as benign),
  but a Web browser believes the content to be HTML (and thus execute
  any scripts contained therein), the end user can be exposed to
  malicious content, making the user vulnerable to cookie theft
  attacks and other cross-site scripting attacks.</p>


  <h4 id="content-type">Content-Type metadata</h4>

  <p>What explicit <dfn title="Content-Type">Content-Type
  metadata</dfn> is associated with the resource (the resource's type
  information) depends on the protocol that was used to
  <span>fetch</span> the resource.</p>

  <p>For HTTP resources, only the first Content-Type HTTP header, if
  any, contributes any type information; the explicit type of the
  resource is then the value of that header, interpreted as described
  by the HTTP specifications. If the Content-Type HTTP header is
  present but the value of the first such header cannot be interpreted
  as described by the HTTP specifications (e.g. because its value
  doesn't contain a U+002F SOLIDUS ('/') character), then the resource
  has no type information (even if there are multiple Content-Type
  HTTP headers and one of the other ones is syntactically correct). <a
  href="#refsHTTP">[HTTP]</a></p>

  <p>For resources fetched from the file system, user agents should use
  platform-specific conventions, e.g. operating system extension/type
  mappings.</p>

  <p>Extensions must not be used for determining resource types for
  resources fetched over HTTP.</p>

  <p>For resources fetched over most other protocols, e.g. FTP, there
  is no type information.</p>


  <p>The <dfn>algorithm for extracting an encoding from a
  Content-Type</dfn>, given a string <var title="">s</var>, is as
  follows. It either returns an encoding or nothing.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Find the first seven characters in <var title="">s</var>
   that are an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the word
   "charset". If no such match is found, return nothing.</p>

   <li><p>Skip any U+0009, U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, or U+0020
   characters that immediately follow the word 'charset' (there might
   not be any).</p></li>

   <li><p>If the next character is not a U+003D EQUALS SIGN ('='),
   return nothing.</p></li>

   <li><p>Skip any U+0009, U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, or U+0020
   characters that immediately follow the equals sign (there might not
   be any).</p></li>

   <li><p>Process the next character as follows:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

     <dt>If it is a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"') and there is a later
     U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"') in <var title="">s</var></dt>

     <dt>If it is a U+0027 APOSTROPHE ("'") and there is a later
     U+0027 APOSTROPHE ("'") in  <var title="">s</var></dt>

     <dd><p>Return the string between this character and the next
     earliest occurrence of this character.</dd>


     <dt>If it is an unmatched U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"')</dt>
     <dt>If it is an unmatched U+0027 APOSTROPHE ("'")</dt>
     <dt>If there is no next character</dt>

     <dd><p>Return nothing.</dd>


     <dt>Otherwise</dt>

     <dd><p>Return the string from this character to the first U+0009,
     U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, U+0020, or U+003B character or the end of
     <var title="">s</var>, whichever comes first.</dd>

    </dl>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">The above algorithm is a willful violation of the
  HTTP specification. <a href="#refsRFC2616">[RFC2616]</a></p>


  <h4>Content-Type sniffing: Web pages</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="Content-Type sniffing">sniffed type of a
  resource</dfn> must be found as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the user agent is configured to strictly obey
   Content-Type headers for this resource, then jump to the last step
   in this set of steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the resource was fetched over an HTTP protocol and there
   is an HTTP Content-Type header and the value of the first such

  <p class="XXX">I'd like to add types like MPEG, AVI, Flash,
  Java, etc, to the above table.</p>

  <p>User agents may support further types if desired, by implicitly
  adding to the above table. However, user agents should not use any
  other patterns for types already mentioned in the table above, as
  this could then be used for privilege escalation (where, e.g., a
  server uses the above table to determine that content is not HTML
  and thus safe from XSS attacks, but then a user agent detects it as
  HTML anyway and allows script to execute).</p>

  <p>The column marked "security" is used by the algorithm in the
  "text or binary" section, to avoid sniffing <code
  title="">text/plain</code> content as a type that can be used for a
  privilege escalation attack.</p>

  <h3>Common DOM interfaces</h3>

  <h4>Reflecting content attributes in DOM attributes</h4>

  <p>Some <span title="DOM attribute">DOM attributes</span> are
  defined to <dfn>reflect</dfn> a particular <span>content
  attribute</span>. This means that on getting, the DOM attribute
  returns the current value of the content attribute, and on setting,
  the DOM attribute changes the value of the content attribute to the
  given value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a <code>DOMString</code>
  attribute whose content attribute is defined to contain a
  <span>URL</span>, then on getting, the DOM attribute must <span
  title="resolve a url">resolve</span> the value of the content
  attribute relative to the element and return the resulting
  <span>absolute URL</span> if that was successful, or the empty
  string otherwise; and on setting, must set the content attribute to
  the specified literal value. If the content attribute is absent, the
  DOM attribute must return the default value, if the content
  attribute has one, or else the empty string.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a <code>DOMString</code>
  attribute whose content attribute is defined to contain one or more
  <span title="URL">URLs</span>, then on getting, the DOM attribute
  must <span title="split a string on spaces">split the content
  attribute on spaces</span> and return the concatenation of <span
  title="resolve a URL">resolving</span> each token URL to an
  <span>absolute URL</span> relative to the element, with a single
  U+0020 SPACE character between each URL, ignoring any tokens that
  did not resolve successfully. If the content attribute is absent,
  the DOM attribute must return the default value, if the content
  attribute has one, or else the empty string. On setting, the DOM
  attribute must set the content attribute to the specified literal
  value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a <code>DOMString</code> whose
  content attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span>, and the
  DOM attribute is <dfn>limited to only known values</dfn>, then, on
  getting, the DOM attribute must return the conforming value
  associated with the state the attribute is in (in its canonical
  case), or the empty string if the attribute is in a state that has
  no associated keyword value; and on setting, if the new value is an
  <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for one of the keywords
  given for that attribute, then the content attribute must be set to
  the conforming value associated with the state that the attribute
  would be in if set to the given new value, otherwise, if the new
  value is the empty string, then the content attribute must be
  removed, otherwise, the setter must raise a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a <code>DOMString</code> but
  doesn't fall into any of the above categories, then the getting and
  setting must be done in a transparent, case-preserving manner.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a boolean attribute, then on
  getting the DOM attribute must return true if the attribute is set,
  and false if it is absent. On setting, the content attribute must be
  removed if the DOM attribute is set to false, and must be set to
  have the same value as its name if the DOM attribute is set to
  true. (This corresponds to the rules for <span title="boolean
  attribute">boolean content attributes</span>.)</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a signed integer type
  (<code>long</code>) then, on getting, the content attribute must be
  parsed according to the <span title="rules for parsing
  integers">rules for parsing signed integers</span>, and if that is
  successful, and the value is in the range of the DOM attribute's
  type, the resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand,
  it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the attribute is
  absent, then the default value must be returned instead, or 0 if
  there is no default value. On setting, the given value must be
  converted to the shortest possible string representing the number as
  a <span>valid integer</span> in base ten and then that string must
  be used as the new content attribute value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is an <em>unsigned</em> integer
  type (<code>unsigned long</code>) then, on getting, the content
  attribute must be parsed according to the <span>rules for parsing
  non-negative integers</span>, and if that is successful, and the
  value is in the range of the DOM attribute's type, the resulting
  value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns
  an out of range value, or if the attribute is absent, the default
  value must be returned instead, or 0 if there is no default
  value. On setting, the given value must be converted to the shortest
  possible string representing the number as a <span>valid
  non-negative integer</span> in base ten and then that string must be
  used as the new content attribute value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is an unsigned integer type
  (<code>unsigned long</code>) that is <dfn>limited to only positive
  non-zero numbers</dfn>, then the behavior is similar to the previous
  case, but zero is not allowed. On getting, the content attribute
  must first be parsed according to the <span>rules for parsing
  non-negative integers</span>, and if that is successful, and the
  value is in the range of the DOM attribute's type, the resulting
  value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns
  an out of range value, or if the attribute is absent, the default
  value must be returned instead, or 1 if there is no default
  value. On setting, if the value is zero, the user agent must fire an
  <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception. Otherwise, the given value
  must be converted to the shortest possible string representing the
  number as a <span>valid non-negative integer</span> in base ten and
  then that string must be used as the new content attribute
  value.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is a floating point number type
  (<code>float</code>) and it doesn't fall into one of the earlier
  categories, then, on getting, the content attribute must be parsed
  according to the <span>rules for parsing floating point number
  values</span>, and if that is successful, and the value is in the
  range of the DOM attribute's type, the resulting value must be
  returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range
  value, or if the attribute is absent, the default value must be
  returned instead, or 0.0 if there is no default value. On setting,
  the given value must be converted to the <span>best representation
  of the floating point number</span> and then that string must be
  used as the new content attribute value.</p>

  <p class="note">The values &plusmn;Infinity and NaN throw an
  exception on setting, as defined by WebIDL. <a
  href="#refsWEBIDL">[WEBIDL]</a></p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute is of the type
  <code>DOMTokenList</code>, then on getting it must return a
  <code>DOMTokenList</code> object whose underlying string is the
  element's corresponding content attribute. When the
  <code>DOMTokenList</code> object mutates its underlying string, the
  content attribute must itself be immediately mutated. When the
  attribute is absent, then the string represented by the
  <code>DOMTokenList</code> object is the empty string; when the
  object mutates this empty string, the user agent must first add the
  corresponding content attribute, and then mutate that attribute
  instead. <code>DOMTokenList</code> attributes are always
  read-only. The same <code>DOMTokenList</code> object must be
  returned every time for each attribute.</p>

  <p>If a reflecting DOM attribute has the type
  <code>HTMLElement</code>, or an interface that descends from
  <code>HTMLElement</code>, then, on getting, it must run the
  following algorithm (stopping at the first point where a value is
  returned):

  <ol>

   <li>If the corresponding content attribute is absent, then the
   DOM attribute must return null.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">candidate</var> be the element that the <code
   title="">document.getElementById()</code> method would find if it
   was passed as its argument the current value of the corresponding
   content attribute.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">candidate</var> is null, or if it is not
   type-compatible with the DOM attribute, then the DOM attribute must
   return null.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, it must return <var title="">candidate</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>On setting, if the given element has an <code
  title="attr-id">id</code> attribute, then the content attribute must
  be set to the value of that <code title="attr-id">id</code>
  attribute. Otherwise, the DOM attribute must be set to the empty
  string.</p><!-- XXX or raise an exception? -->



  <h4>Collections</h4>

  <p>The <code>HTMLCollection</code>,
  <code>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code>, and
  <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code> interfaces represent various
  lists of DOM nodes. Collectively, objects implementing these
  interfaces are called <dfn>collections</dfn>.</p>

  <p>When a <span title="collections">collection</span> is created, a
  filter and a root are associated with the collection.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, when the <code>HTMLCollection</code>
  object for the <code
  title="dom-document-images">document.images</code> attribute is
  created, it is associated with a filter that selects only
  <code>img</code> elements, and rooted at the root of the
  document.</p>

  <p>The <span title="collections">collection</span> then <dfn
  title="represented by the collection">represents</dfn> a
  <span>live</span> view of the subtree rooted at the collection's
  root, containing only nodes that match the given filter. The view is
  linear. In the absence of specific requirements to the contrary, the
  nodes within the collection must be sorted in <span>tree
  order</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> list is
  not in tree order.</p>

  <p>An attribute that returns a collection must return the same
  object every time it is retrieved.</p>


  <h5>HTMLCollection</h5>

  <p>The <code>HTMLCollection</code> interface represents a generic
  <span title="collections">collection</span> of elements.</p>

  <pre class="idl">[Callable=<span title="dom-HTMLCollection-namedItem">namedItem</span>]
interface <dfn>HTMLCollection</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-HTMLCollection-length">length</span>;
  [IndexGetter] Element <span title="dom-HTMLCollection-item">item</span>(in unsigned long index);
  [NameGetter] Element <span title="dom-HTMLCollection-namedItem">namedItem</span>(in DOMString name);
};</pre>

  <p>The object's <span>indices of the supported indexed
  properties</span> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than
  the number of nodes <span>represented by the collection</span>. If
  there are no such elements, then there are no <span>supported
  indexed properties</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLCollection-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of nodes <span>represented by the
  collection</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-HTMLCollection-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection. If there is no <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection, then the method must
  return null.</p>

  <p>The <span>names of the supported named properties</span> consist
  of the values of the <code title="">name</code> attributes of each
  <code>a</code>, <code>applet</code>, <code>area</code>,
  <code>embed</code>, <code>form</code>, <code>frame</code>,
  <code>frameset</code>, <code>iframe</code>, <code>img</code>, and
  <code>object</code> element <span>represented by the
  collection</span> with a <code title="">name</code> attribute, plus
  the list of IDs that the elements <span>represented by the
  collection</span> have.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLCollection-namedItem"><code>namedItem(<var
  title="">key</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the first node
  in the collection that matches the following requirements:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>It is an <code>a</code>, <code>applet</code>,
   <code>area</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>form</code>,
   <code>frame</code>, <code>frameset</code>, <code>iframe</code>,
   <code>img</code>, or <code>object</code> element with a <code
   title="">name</code> attribute equal to <var title="">key</var>,
   or,</li>

   <li>It is an element with an ID <var title="">key</var>.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>If no such elements are found, then the method must return
  null.</p>



  <h5>HTMLFormControlsCollection</h5>

  <p>The <code>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code> interface represents
  a <span title="collections">collection</span> of <span
  title="category-listed">listed</span> elements in <code>form</code>
  and <code>fieldset</code> elements.</p>

  <pre class="idl">[Callable=<span title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-namedItem">namedItem</span>]

  [NameGetter] Object <span title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-namedItem">namedItem</span>(in DOMString name);
};</pre>

  <p>The object's <span>indices of the supported indexed
  properties</span> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than
  the number of nodes <span>represented by the collection</span>. If
  there are no such elements, then there are no <span>supported
  indexed properties</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of nodes <span>represented by the
  collection</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection. If there is no <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection, then the method must
  return null.</p>

  <p>The <span>names of the supported named properties</span> consist
  of the values of all the <code title="attr-id">id</code> and <code
  title="attr-fe-name">name</code> attributes of all the elements
  <span>represented by the collection</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-namedItem"><code>namedItem(<var
  title="">name</var>)</code></dfn> method must act according to the
  following algorithm:

  <ol>

   <li>If, at the time the method is called, there is exactly one node
   in the collection that has either an <code
   title="attr-id">id</code> attribute or a <code
   title="attr-fe-name">name</code> attribute equal to <var
   title="">name</var>, then return that node and stop the
   algorithm.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if there are no nodes in the collection that have
   either an <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute or a <code
   title="attr-fe-name">name</code> attribute equal to <var
   title="">name</var>, then return null and stop the algorithm.</li>

   <!-- XXX should we return an HTMLCollection instead, like IE? -->
   <li>Otherwise, create a <code>NodeList</code> object representing a
   live view of the <code>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code> object,
   further filtered so that the only nodes in the
   <code>NodeList</code> object are those that have either an <code
   title="attr-id">id</code> attribute or a <code
   title="attr-fe-name">name</code> attribute equal to <var
   title="">name</var>. The nodes in the <code>NodeList</code> object
   must be sorted in <span>tree order</span>.</li>

   <li>Return that <code>NodeList</code> object.</li>

  <h5>HTMLOptionsCollection</h5>

  <p>The <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code> interface represents a
  list of <code>option</code> elements. It is always rooted on a
  <code>select</code> element and has attributes and methods that
  manipulate that element's descendants.</p>

  <pre class="idl">[Callable=<span title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-namedItem">namedItem</span>]
interface <dfn>HTMLOptionsCollection</dfn> {
           attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-length">length</span>;
  [IndexGetter] <span>HTMLOptionElement</span> <span title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-item">item</span>(in unsigned long index);

  void <span title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-add">add</span>(in <span>HTMLElement</span> element, in <span>HTMLElement</span> before);
  void <span title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-add">add</span>(in <span>HTMLElement</span> element, in long before);
  void <span title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-remove">remove</span>(in long index);
};</pre>

  <p>The object's <span>indices of the supported indexed
  properties</span> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than
  the number of nodes <span>represented by the collection</span>. If
  there are no such elements, then there are no <span>supported
  indexed properties</span>.</p>

  <p>On getting, the <dfn
  title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of nodes <span>represented by the
  collection</span>.</p>

  <p>On setting, the behavior depends on whether the new value is
  equal to, greater than, or less than the number of nodes
  <span>represented by the collection</span> at that time. If the
  number is the same, then setting the attribute must do nothing. If
  the new value is greater, then <var title="">n</var> new
  <code>option</code> elements with no attributes and no child nodes
  must be appended to the <code>select</code> element on which the
  <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code> is rooted, where <var
  title="">n</var> is the difference between the two numbers (new
  value minus old value). If the new value is lower, then the last
  <var title="">n</var> nodes in the collection must be removed from
  their parent nodes, where <var title="">n</var> is the difference
  between the two numbers (old value minus new value).</p>

  <p class="note">Setting <code
  title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-length">length</code> never removes
  or adds any <code>optgroup</code> elements, and never adds new
  children to existing <code>optgroup</code> elements (though it can
  remove children from them).</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">index</var>th node in the collection. If there is no <var

  return null.</p>

  <p>The <span>names of the supported named properties</span> consist
  of the values of all the <code title="attr-id">id</code> and <code
  title="attr-option-name">name</code> attributes of all the elements
  <span>represented by the collection</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-HTMLOptionsCollection-add"><code>add(<var

  <h4>DOMTokenList</h4>

  <p>The <code>DOMTokenList</code> interface represents an interface
  to an underlying string that consists of an <span>unordered set of
  unique space-separated tokens</span>.</p>

  <p>Which string underlies a particular <code>DOMTokenList</code>
  object is defined when the object is created. It might be a content
  attribute (e.g. the string that underlies the <code
  title="dom-classList">classList</code> object is the <code
  title="attr-class">class</code> attribute), or it might be an
  anonymous string (e.g. when a <code>DOMTokenList</code> object is

  <h4>Safe passing of structured data</h4>

  <p>When a user agent is required to obtain a <dfn>structured

  either returns a separate object, or throws an exception.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the object being
   cloned.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">memory</var> be a list of objects,
   initially empty. (This is used to catch cycles.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">output</var> be the object resulting from
   calling the <span>internal structured cloning algorithm</span> with
   <var title="">input</var> and <var title="">memory</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return <var title="">output</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn>internal structured cloning algorithm</dfn> is always
  called with two arguments, <var title="">input</var> and <var
  title="">memory</var>, and its behavior depends on the type of <var
  title="">input</var>, as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is the undefined value</dt>

   <dd><p>Return the undefined value.</p></dd>

   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is the null value</dt>

   <dd><p>Return the null value.</p></dd>

   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is the false value</dt>

   <dd><p>Return the false value.</p></dd>

   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is the true value</dt>

   <dd><p>Return the true value.</p></dd>

   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is a Number object</dt>

   <dd><p>Return a newly constructed Number object with the same value as <var title="">input</var>.</p></dd>

   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is a String object</dt>

   <dd><p>Return a newly constructed String object with the same value as <var title="">input</var>.</p></dd>

   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is a Date object</dt>

   <dd><p>Return a newly constructed Date object with the same value as <var title="">input</var>.</p></dd>

   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is a host object</dt>

   <dd><p>Return the null value.</p></dd>

   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is an Array object</dt>
   <dt>If <var title="">input</var> is an Object object</dt>

   <dd>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If <var title="">input</var> is in <var
     title="">memory</var>, then throw a
     <code>NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR</code> exception and abort the overall
     <span>structured clone</span> algorithm.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, let <var title="">new memory</var> be a list
     consisting of the items in <var title="">memory</var> with the
     addition of <var title="">input</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Create a new object, <var title="">output</var>, of the
     same type as <var title="">input</var>: either an Array or an
     Object.</p></li>

     <li><p>For each property in <var title="">input</var>, add a
     corresponding property to <var title="">output</var> having the
     same name, and having a value created from invoking the
     <span>internal structured cloning algorithm</span> recursively
     with the value of the property as the "<var title="">input</var>"
     argument and <var title="">new memory</var> as the "<var
     title="">memory</var>" argument. The order of the properties in
     the <var title="">input</var> and <var title="">output</var>
     objects must be the same.</p></li>

     <li><p>Return <var title="">output</var>.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </dd>

  </dl>



  <h4>DOMStringMap</h4>

  <p>The <code>DOMStringMap</code> interface represents a set of
  name-value pairs. When a <code>DOMStringMap</code> object is
  instantiated, it is associated with three algorithms, one for
  getting getting the list of name-value pairs, one for setting names
  to certain values, and one for deleting names.</p>

  <pre class="idl">[NameCreator, NameDeleter, NameGetter, NameSetter]
interface <dfn>DOMStringMap</dfn> {};</pre>

  <p>The <span>names of the supported named properties</span> on a
  <code>DOMStringMap</code> object at any instant are the names of
  each pair returned from the algorithm for getting the list of
  name-value pairs at that instant.</p>

  <p>When a <code>DOMStringMap</code> object is indexed to retrieve a
  named property <var title="">name</var>, the value returned must be
  the value component of the name-value pair whose name component is
  <var title="">name</var> in the list returned by the algorithm for
  getting the list of name-value pairs.</p>

  <p>When a <code>DOMStringMap</code> object is indexed to create or
  modify a named property <var title="">name</var> with value <var
  title="">value</var>, the algorithm for setting names to certain
  values must be run, passing <var title="">name</var> as the name and
  the result of converting <var title="">value</var> to a
  <code>DOMString</code> as the value.</p>

  <p>When a <code>DOMStringMap</code> object is indexed to delete a
  named property named <var title="">name</var>, the algorithm for
  deleting names must be run, passing <var title="">name</var> as the
  name.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>DOMStringMap</code> interface definition
  here is only intended for JavaScript environments. Other language
  bindings will need to define how <code>DOMStringMap</code> is to be
  implemented for those languages.</p>


  <h4>DOM feature strings</h4>

  <p>DOM3 Core defines mechanisms for checking for interface support,
  and for obtaining implementations of interfaces, using <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#DOMFeatures">feature
  strings</a>. <a href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>

  <p>A DOM application can use the <dfn
  title="hasFeature"><code>hasFeature(<var title="">feature</var>,
  <var title="">version</var>)</code></dfn> method of the
  <code>DOMImplementation</code> interface with parameter values
  "<code title="">HTML</code>" and "<code>5.0</code>" (respectively)
  to determine whether or not this module is supported by the
  implementation. In addition to the feature string "<code
  title="">HTML</code>", the feature string "<code
  title="">XHTML</code>" (with version string "<code>5.0</code>") can
  be used to check if the implementation supports XHTML. User agents
  should respond with a true value when the <code>hasFeature</code>
  method is queried with these values. Authors are cautioned, however,
  that UAs returning true might not be perfectly compliant, and that
  UAs returning false might well have support for features in this
  specification; in general, therefore, use of this method is
  discouraged.</p>

  <p>The values "<code title="">HTML</code>" and "<code
  title="">XHTML</code>" (both with version "<code>5.0</code>") should
  also be supported in the context of the <code>getFeature()</code>
  and <code>isSupported()</code> methods, as defined by DOM3 Core.</p>

  <p class="note">The interfaces defined in this specification are not
  always supersets of the interfaces defined in DOM2 HTML; some
  features that were formerly deprecated, poorly supported, rarely
  used or considered unnecessary have been removed. Therefore it is
  not guaranteed that an implementation that supports "<code
  title="">HTML</code>" "<code>5.0</code>" also supports "<code
  title="">HTML</code>" "<code>2.0</code>".</p>


  <h4>Exceptions</h4>

  <p>The following <code>DOMException</code> codes are defined in DOM
  Core. <a href="#refsDOMCORE">[DOMCORE]</a></p>

  <h4>Garbage collection</h4>

  <p>There is an <dfn>implied strong reference</dfn> from any DOM
  attribute that returns a pre-existing object to that object.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, the <code>document.location</code> attribute means
   that there is a strong reference from a <code>Document</code>
   object to its <code>Location</code> object. Similarly, there is
   always a strong reference from a <code>Document</code> to any
   descendant nodes, and from any node to its owner
   <code>Document</code>.</p>

  </div>




  <h2 id="dom">Semantics and structure of HTML documents</h2>

  <h3 id="semantics-intro">Introduction</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p class="XXX">An introduction to marking up a document.</p>


  <h3>Documents</h3>

  <p>Every XML and HTML document in an HTML UA is represented by a
  <code>Document</code> object. <a
  href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>

  <p><dfn>The document's address</dfn> is an <span>absolute URL</span>
  that is set when the <code>Document</code> is created.</p>

  <p>When a <code>Document</code> is created by a <span
  title="concept-script">script</span> using the <code
  title="">createDocument()</code> API, <span>the document's
  address</span> is the same as <span>the document's address</span> of
  the <span>active document</span> of the <span>script's browsing
  context</span>.</p>

  <p><code>Document</code> objects are assumed to be <dfn>XML
  documents</dfn> unless they are flagged as being <dfn>HTML
  documents</dfn> when they are created. Whether a document is an
  <span title="HTML documents">HTML document</span> or an <span
  title="XML documents">XML document</span> affects the behavior of
  certain APIs, as well as a few CSS rendering rules. <a
  href="#refsCSS21">[CSS21]</a></p>

  <p class="note">A <code>Document</code> object created by the <code
  title="">createDocument()</code> API on the
  <code>DOMImplementation</code> object is initially an <span
  title="XML documents">XML document</span>, but can be made into an
  <span title="HTML documents">HTML document</span> by calling <code
  title="dom-document-open">document.open()</code> on it.</p>



  <h4>Documents in the DOM</h4>

  <p>All <code>Document</code> objects (in user agents implementing
  this specification) must also implement the
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface, available using
  binding-specific methods. (This is the case whether or not the
  document in question is an <span title="HTML documents">HTML
  document</span> or indeed whether it contains any <span>HTML
  elements</span> at all.) <code>Document</code> objects must also
  implement the document-level interface of any other namespaces found
  in the document that the UA supports. For example, if an HTML
  implementation also supports SVG, then the <code>Document</code>
  object must implement <code>HTMLDocument</code> and
  <code>SVGDocument</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">Because the <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface is
  now obtained using binding-specific casting methods instead of
  simply being the primary interface of the document object, it is no
  longer defined as inheriting from <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>Since the <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface holds methods and
  attributes related to a number of disparate features, the members of
  this interface are described in various different sections.</p>


  <h4>Security</h4>

  <p>User agents must raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception whenever
  any of the members of an <code>HTMLDocument</code> object are
  accessed by scripts whose <span>effective script origin</span> is
  not the <span title="same origin">same</span> as the
  <code>Document</code>'s <span>effective script origin</span>.</p>



  <h4><dfn>Resource metadata management</dfn></h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-URL"><code>URL</code></dfn>
  attribute must return <span>the document's address</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-referrer"><code>referrer</code></dfn> attribute
  must return either the <span title="the document's
  address">address</span> of the <span>active document</span> of the
  <span>source browsing context</span> at the time the navigation was
  started (that is, the page which <span
  title="navigate">navigated</span> the <span>browsing context</span>
  to the current document), or the empty string if there is no such
  originating page, or if the UA has been configured not to report
  referrers in this case, or if the navigation was initiated for a
  <span>hyperlink</span> with a <code
  title="rel-noreferrer">noreferrer</code> keyword.</p>

  <p class="note">In the case of HTTP, the <code
  title="dom-document-referrer">referrer</code> DOM attribute will
  match the <code title="http-referer">Referer</code> (sic) header
  that was sent when <span title="fetch">fetching</span> the current
  page.</p>

  <p class="note">Typically user agents are configured to not report
  referrers in the case where the referrer uses an encrypted protocol
  and the current page does not (e.g. when navigating from an <code
  title="">https:</code> page to an <code title="">http:</code>
  page).</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-cookie"><code>cookie</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the cookies of the resource.</p>

  <p id="sandboxCookies">On getting, if the document is not associated
  with a <span>browsing context</span> then the user agent must raise
  an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception. Otherwise, if the
  <span>sandboxed origin browsing context flag</span> is set on the
  <span>browsing context</span> of the document, the user agent must
  raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception. Otherwise, if <span>the
  document's address</span> does not use a server-based naming
  authority, it must return the empty string. Otherwise, it must
  return the same string as the value of the <code
  title="">Cookie</code> HTTP header it would include if <span
  title="fetch">fetching</span> the resource indicated by <span>the
  document's address</span> over HTTP, as per RFC 2109 section 4.3.4
  or later specifications, excluding HTTP-only cookies. <a
  href="#refsRFC2109">[RFC2109]</a> <a
  href="#refsRFC2965">[RFC2965]</a></p>

  <p>On setting, if the document is not associated with a
  <span>browsing context</span> then the user agent must raise an
  <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception. Otherwise, if the
  <span>sandboxed origin browsing context flag</span> is set on the
  <span>browsing context</span> of the document, the user agent must
  raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception. Otherwise, if <span>the
  document's address</span> does not use a server-based naming
  authority, it must do nothing. Otherwise, the user agent must act as
  it would when processing cookies if it had just attempted to
  <span>fetch</span> <span>the document's address</span> over HTTP,
  and had received a response with a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header
  whose value was the specified value, as per RFC 2109 sections 4.3.1,
  4.3.2, and 4.3.3 or later specifications, but without overwriting
  the values of HTTP-only cookies. <a
  href="#refsRFC2109">[RFC2109]</a> <a
  href="#refsRFC2965">[RFC2965]</a></p>

  <p class="note">This specification does not define what makes an
  HTTP-only cookie, and at the time of publication the editor is not
  aware of any reference for HTTP-only cookies. They are a feature
  supported by some Web browsers wherein an "<code
  title="">httponly</code>" parameter added to the cookie string
  causes the cookie to be hidden from script.</p>

  <p class="note">Since the <code
  title="dom-document-cookie">cookie</code> attribute is accessible
  across frames, the path restrictions on cookies are only a tool to
  help manage which cookies are sent to which parts of the site, and
  are not in any way a security feature.</p>

  <hr> 

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-lastModified"><code>lastModified</code></dfn>
  attribute, on getting, must return the date and time of the
  <code>Document</code>'s source file's last modification, in the
  user's local timezone, in the following format:</p>

  <ol>

   <li> The month component of the date. </li>

   <li> A U+002F SOLIDUS character ('/'). </li>

   <li> The day component of the date. </li>

   <li> A U+002F SOLIDUS character ('/'). </li>

   <li> The year component of the date. </li>

   <li> A U+0020 SPACE character. </li>

   <li> The hours component of the time. </li>

   <li> A U+003A COLON character (':'). </li>

   <li> The minutes component of the time. </li>

   <li> A U+003A COLON character (':'). </li>

   <li> The seconds component of the time. </li>

  </ol>

  <p>All the numeric components above, other than the year, must be
  given as two digits in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT
  NINE representing the number in base ten, zero-padded if
  necessary.</p>

  <p>The <code>Document</code>'s source file's last modification date
  and time must be derived from relevant features of the networking
  protocols used, e.g. from the value of the HTTP <code
  title="">Last-Modified</code> header of the document, or from
  metadata in the file system for local files. If the last modification
  date and time are not known, the attribute must return the string
  <code title="">01/01/1970 00:00:00</code>.</p>


  <p>A <code>Document</code> is always set to one of three modes:
  <dfn>no quirks mode</dfn>, the default; <dfn>quirks mode</dfn>, used
  typically for legacy documents; and <dfn>limited quirks mode</dfn>,
  also known as "almost standards" mode. The mode is only ever changed
  from the default by the <span>HTML parser</span>, based on the
  presence, absence, or value of the DOCTYPE string.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-compatMode"><code>compatMode</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return the literal string "<code
  title="">CSS1Compat</code>" unless the document has been set to
  <span>quirks mode</span> by the <span>HTML parser</span>, in which
  case it must instead return the literal string "<code
  title="">BackCompat</code>".</p>

  <div class="XXX">

   <p>As far as parsing goes, the quirks I know of are:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>Comment parsing is different.</li>

    <li><code>p</code> can contain <code>table</code></li>

    <li>Safari and IE have special parsing rules for &lt;% ... %&gt;
    (even in standards mode, though clearly this should be
    quirks-only).</li>

   </ul>

  </div>



  <p>Documents have an associated <dfn title="document's character
  encoding">character encoding</dfn>. When a <code>Document</code>
  object is created, the <span>document's character encoding</span>
  must be initialized to UTF-16. Various algorithms during page
  loading affect this value, as does the <code
  title="dom-document-charset">charset</code> setter.  <a
  href="#refsIANACHARSET">[IANACHARSET]</a> <!-- XXX
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets --></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-charset"><code>charset</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must, on getting, return the preferred MIME name of
  the <span>document's character encoding</span>. On setting, if the
  new value is an IANA-registered alias for a character encoding, the
  <span>document's character encoding</span> must be set to that
  character encoding. (Otherwise, nothing happens.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-characterSet"><code>characterSet</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must, on getting, return the preferred MIME name of
  the <span>document's character encoding</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-defaultCharset"><code>defaultCharset</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must, on getting, return the preferred MIME name of a
  character encoding, possibly the user's default encoding, or an
  encoding associated with the user's current geographical location,
  or any arbitrary encoding name.</p>

  <p>Each document has a <dfn>current document readiness</dfn>. When a
  <code>Document</code> object is created, it must have its
  <span>current document readiness</span> set to the string "loading"
  if the document is associated with an <span>HTML parser</span> or an
  <span>XML parser</span>, or to the string "complete"
  otherwise. Various algorithms during page loading affect this
  value. When the value is set, the user agent must <span>fire a
  simple event</span> called <code
  title="event-readystatechange">readystatechange</code> at the
  <code>Document</code> object.</p> <!-- XXX define
  document.onreadystatechange -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-readyState"><code>readyState</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must, on getting, return the <span>current document
  readiness</span>.</p>



  <h4><dfn>DOM tree accessors</dfn></h4>

  <p><dfn>The <code>html</code> element</dfn> of a document is the
  document's root element, if there is one and it's an
  <code>html</code> element, or null otherwise.</p>

  <p><dfn>The <code>head</code> element</dfn> of a document is the
  first <code>head</code> element that is a child of <span>the
  <code>html</code> element</span>, if there is one, or null
  otherwise.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><dfn>The <code>title</code> element</dfn> of a document is the

  <p>The <dfn id="document.title"
  title="dom-document-title"><code>title</code></dfn> attribute must,
  on getting, run the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <span>root element</span> is an <code>svg</code>
   element in the "<code title="">http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code>"
   namespace, and the user agent supports SVG, then the getter must
   return the value that would have been returned by the DOM attribute
   of the same name on the <code>SVGDocument</code>
   interface.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, it must return a concatenation of the data of all
   the child <span title="text node">text nodes</span> of <span>the
   <code>title</code> element</span>, in tree order, or the empty
   string if <span>the <code>title</code> element</span> is
   null.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>On setting, the following algorithm must be run:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <span>root element</span> is an <code>svg</code>
   element in the "<code title="">http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code>"
   namespace, and the user agent supports SVG, then the setter must
   defer to the setter for the DOM attribute of the same name on the
   <code>SVGDocument</code> interface (if it is readonly, then this
   will raise an exception). Stop the algorithm here.</p></li>

   <li>If <span>the <code>title</code> element</span> is null and
   <span>the <code>head</code> element</span> is null, then the
   attribute must do nothing. Stop the algorithm here.</li>

   <!-- XXX define the following two paragraphs with respect to
   mutation events (e.g. are mutation events fired synchronously) -->

   <li>If <span>the <code>title</code> element</span> is null, then a
   new <code>title</code> element must be created and appended to
   <span>the <code>head</code> element</span>.</li>

   <li>The children of <span>the <code>title</code> element</span> (if
   any) must all be removed.</li>

   <li>A single <code>Text</code> node whose data is the new value
   being assigned must be appended to <span>the <code>title</code>
   element</span>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <code title="dom-document-title">title</code> attribute on
  the <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface should shadow the attribute
  of the same name on the <code>SVGDocument</code> interface when the
  user agent supports both HTML and SVG.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><dfn>The body element</dfn> of a document is the first child of
  <span>the <code>html</code> element</span> that is either a
  <code>body</code> element or a <code>frameset</code> element. If
  there is no such element, it is null. If the body element is null,
  then when the specification requires that events be fired at "the
  body element", they must instead be fired at the
  <code>Document</code> object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-body"><code>body</code></dfn>
  attribute, on getting, must return <span>the body element</span> of
  the document (either a <code>body</code> element, a
  <code>frameset</code> element, or null). On setting, the following
  algorithm must be run:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the new value is not a <code>body</code> or
   <code>frameset</code> element, then raise a
   <code>HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR</code> exception and abort these
   steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the new value is the same as <span>the body
   element</span>, do nothing. Abort these steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if <span>the body element</span> is not null, then
   replace that element with the new value in the DOM, as if the root
   element's <code title="">replaceChild()</code> method had been
   called with the new value and <span title="the body element">the
   incumbent body element</span> as its two arguments respectively,
   then abort these steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, the <span>the body element</span> is null. Append
   the new value to the root element.</li>

  <h3>Elements</h3>

  <h4>Semantics</h4>

  <p>Elements, attributes, and attribute values in HTML are defined
  (by this specification) to have certain meanings (semantics). For
  example, the <code>ol</code> element represents an ordered list, and
  the <code title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute represents the
  language of the content.</p>

  <p>Authors must not use elements, attributes, and attribute values
  for purposes other than their appropriate intended semantic
  purpose.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, the following document is non-conforming, despite
   being syntactically correct:</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-GB"&gt;
 &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Demonstration &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; My favourite animal is the cat. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
     &mdash;&lt;a href="http://example.org/~ernest/"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ernest&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
     in an essay from 1992
    &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

   <p>...because the data placed in the cells is clearly not tabular
   data (and the <code>cite</code> element mis-used). A corrected
   version of this document might be:</p>

   <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-GB"&gt;
 &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Demonstration &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt; My favourite animal is the cat. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &mdash;&lt;a href="http://example.org/~ernest/"&gt;Ernest&lt;/a&gt;,
   in an essay from 1992
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

   <p>This next document fragment, intended to represent the heading
   of a corporate site, is similarly non-conforming because the second
   line is not intended to be a heading of a subsection, but merely a
   subheading or subtitle (a subordinate heading for the same
   section).</p>

   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;ABC Company&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;Leading the way in widget design since 1432&lt;/h2&gt;
 ...</pre>

   <p>The <code>header</code> element should be used in these kinds of
   situations:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;header&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;ABC Company&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Leading the way in widget design since 1432&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;/header&gt;
 ...</pre>

  </div>

  <p>Through scripting and using other mechanisms, the values of
  attributes, text, and indeed the entire structure of the document
  may change dynamically while a user agent is processing it. The
  semantics of a document at an instant in time are those represented
  by the state of the document at that instant in time, and the
  semantics of a document can therefore change over time. User agents
  must update their presentation of the document as this occurs.</p>

  <p class="example">HTML has a <code>progress</code> element that
  describes a progress bar. If its "value" attribute is dynamically
  updated by a script, the UA would update the rendering to show the
  progress changing.</p>



  <h4>Elements in the DOM</h4>

  <p>The nodes representing <span>HTML elements</span> in the DOM must
  implement, and expose to scripts, the interfaces listed for them in
  the relevant sections of this specification. This includes
  <span>HTML elements</span> in <span>XML documents</span>, even when
  those documents are in another context (e.g. inside an XSLT
  transform).</p>

  <p>Elements in the DOM <span title="represents">represent</span>
  things; that is, they have intrinsic <em>meaning</em>, also known as
  semantics.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, an <code>ol</code> element
  represents an ordered list.</p>

  <p>The basic interface, from which all the <span>HTML
  elements</span>' interfaces inherit, and which must be used by
  elements that have no additional requirements, is the
  <code>HTMLElement</code> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>HTMLElement</dfn> : <span>Element</span> {

  <p class="note">The attributes marked with an asterisk cannot be
  specified on <code>body</code> elements as those elements expose
  <span>event handler attributes</span> of the <code>Window</code>
  object with the same names.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Also, <span title="custom data attribute">custom data
  attributes</span> (e.g. <code title="">data-foldername</code> or
  <code title="">data-msgid</code>) can be specified on any <span
  title="HTML elements">HTML element</span>, to store custom data
  specific to the page.</p>

  <p>In <span>HTML documents</span>, elements in the <span>HTML
  namespace</span> may have an <code title="">xmlns</code> attribute
  specified, if, and only if, it has the exact value
  "<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>". This does not apply to
  <span>XML documents</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">In HTML, the <code title="">xmlns</code> attribute
  has absolutely no effect. It is basically a talisman. It is allowed
  merely to make migration to and from XHTML mildly easier. When
  parsed by an <span>HTML parser</span>, the attribute ends up in no
  namespace, not the "<code>http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/</code>"
  namespace like namespace declaration attributes in XML do.</p>

  <p class="note">In XML, an <code title="">xmlns</code> attribute is
  part of the namespace declaration mechanism, and an element cannot
  actually have an <code title="">xmlns</code> attribute in no
  namespace specified.</p>


  <h5>The <dfn title="attr-id"><code>id</code></dfn> attribute</h5>

  <p>The <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute
  <span>represents</span> its element's unique identifier. The value
  must be unique in the element's <span>home subtree</span> and must
  contain at least one character. The value must not contain any <span
  title="space character">space characters</span>.</p>

  <!-- space characters are disallowed because space-separated lists
  of IDs otherwise would not be able to reach all valid IDs -->

  <p>If the value is not the empty string, user agents must associate
  the element with the given value (exactly, including any space
  characters) for the purposes of ID matching within the element's
  <span>home subtree</span> (e.g. for selectors in CSS or for the
  <code>getElementById()</code> method in the DOM).</p>

  <p>Identifiers are opaque strings. Particular meanings should not be
  derived from the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code>
  attribute.</p>

  <p>This specification doesn't preclude an element having multiple
  IDs, if other mechanisms (e.g. DOM Core methods) can set an
  element's ID in a way that doesn't conflict with the <code
  title="attr-id">id</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-id"><code>id</code></dfn> DOM attribute must
  <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-id">id</code> content
  attribute.</p>


  <h5>The <dfn title="attr-title"><code>title</code></dfn> attribute</h5>

  <p>The <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute
  <span>represents</span> advisory information for the element, such
  as would be appropriate for a tooltip. On a link, this could be the
  title or a description of the target resource; on an image, it could
  be the image credit or a description of the image; on a paragraph,
  it could be a footnote or commentary on the text; on a citation, it
  could be further information about the source; and so forth. The
  value is text.</p>

  <p>If this attribute is omitted from an element, then it implies
  that the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute of the
  nearest ancestor <span title="HTML elements">HTML element</span>
  with a <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute set is also
  relevant to this element. Setting the attribute overrides this,
  explicitly stating that the advisory information of any ancestors is
  not relevant to this element.  Setting the attribute to the empty
  string indicates that the element has no advisory information.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute's value
  contains U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters, the content is split into
  multiple lines. Each U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character represents a
  line break.</p>

  <p>Some elements, such as <code>link</code>, <code>abbr</code>, and
  <code>input</code>, define additional semantics for the <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute beyond the semantics
  described above.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-title"><code>title</code></dfn> DOM attribute
  must <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-title">title</code>
  content attribute.</p>


  <h5>The <dfn title="attr-lang"><code>lang</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="attr-xml-lang"><code>xml:lang</code></dfn>
  attributes</h5>

  <p>The <code title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute specifies the
  primary <dfn>language</dfn> for the element's contents and for any
  of the element's attributes that contain text. Its value must be a
  valid RFC 3066 language code, or the empty string. <a
  href="#refsRFC3066">[RFC3066]</a></p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> attribute (that
  is, the <code title="">lang</code> attribute with the <code
  title="">xml</code> prefix in the <code
  title="">http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace</code> namespace) is
  defined in XML. <a href="#refsXML">[XML]</a></p>

  <p>If these attributes are omitted from an element, then the
  language of this element is the same as the language of its parent
  element, if any. Setting the attribute to the empty string indicates
  that the primary language is unknown.</p> <!-- UA conformance
  requires for this are below -->

  <p>The <code title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute may be used on
  any <span title="HTML elements">HTML element</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> attribute may be
  used on <span>HTML elements</span> in <span>XML documents</span>, as
  well as elements in other namespaces if the relevant specifications
  allow it (in particular, MathML and SVG allow <code
  title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> attributes to be specified on
  their elements). If both the <code title="attr-lang">lang</code>
  attribute and the <code title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code>
  attribute are specified on the same element, they must have exactly
  the same value when compared in an <span>ASCII
  case-insensitive</span> manner.</p>

  <p>Authors must not use the <code
  title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> attribute (that is, the <code
  title="">lang</code> attribute with the <code title="">xml</code>
  prefix in the <code
  title="">http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace</code> namespace) in
  <span>HTML documents</span>. To ease migration to and from XHTML,
  authors may specify an attribute in no namespace with no prefix and
  with the localname <code title="">xml:lang</code> on <span>HTML
  elements</span> in <span>HTML documents</span>, but such attributes
  must only be specified if a <code title="attr-lang">lang</code>
  attribute is also specified, and both attributes must have the same
  value when compared in an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span>
  manner.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>To determine the language of a node, user agents must look at the
  nearest ancestor element (including the element itself if the node
  is an element) that has an <code
  title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> attribute set or is an <span
  title="HTML elements">HTML element</span> and has a <code
  title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute set. That attribute
  specifies the language of the node.</p>

  <p>If both the <code title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> attribute
  and the <code title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute are set on an
  element, user agents must use the <code
  title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> attribute, and the <code
  title="attr-lang">lang</code> attribute must be <span
  title="ignore">ignored</span> for the purposes of determining the
  element's language.</p>

  <p>If no explicit language is given for the <span>root
  element</span>, but there is a <span>document-wide default
  language</span> set, then that is the language of the node.</p>

  <p>If there is no <span>document-wide default language</span>, then
  language information from a higher-level protocol (such as HTTP), if
  any, must be used as the final fallback language. In the absence of
  any language information, the default value is unknown (the empty
  string).</p>

  <p>If the resulting value is not a recognised language code, then it
  must be treated as an unknown language (as if the value was the
  empty string).</p>

  <hr>

  <p>User agents may use the element's language to determine proper
  processing or rendering (e.g. in the selection of appropriate
  fonts or pronunciations, or for dictionary selection). <!--User
  agents must not use the element's language to determine text
  directionality. (commented out because text directionality is a
  rendering-level concern.)--></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-lang"><code>lang</code></dfn> DOM attribute
  must <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-lang">lang</code>
  content attribute.</p>


  <h5>The <dfn title="attr-xml-base"><code>xml:base</code></dfn>
  attribute (XML only)</h5>

  <p>The <code title="attr-xml-base">xml:base</code> attribute is
  defined in XML Base. <a href="#refsXMLBASE">[XMLBASE]</a></p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-xml-base">xml:base</code> attribute may be
  used on elements of <span>XML documents</span>.  Authors must not
  use the <code title="attr-xml-base">xml:base</code> attribute in
  <span>HTML documents</span>.</p>


  <h5>The <dfn title="attr-dir"><code>dir</code></dfn> attribute</h5>

  <p>The <code title="attr-dir">dir</code> attribute specifies the
  element's text directionality. The attribute is an <span>enumerated
  attribute</span> with the keyword <code title="">ltr</code> mapping
  to the state <i>ltr</i>, and the keyword <code title="">rtl</code>
  mapping to the state <i>rtl</i>. The attribute has no
  defaults.</p>

  <p>The processing of this attribute is primarily performed by the
  presentation layer. For example, the rendering section in this
  specification defines a mapping from this attribute to the CSS
  'direction' and 'unicode-bidi' properties, and CSS defines rendering
  in terms of those properties.</p>

  <p><dfn>The directionality</dfn> of an element, which is used in
  particular by the <code>canvas</code> element's text rendering API,
  is either 'ltr' or 'rtl'. If the user agent supports CSS and the
  'direction' property on this element has a computed value of either
  'ltr' or 'rtl', then that is <span>the directionality</span> of the
  element. Otherwise, if the element is being rendered, then <span>the
  directionality</span> of the element is the directionality used by
  the presentation layer, potentially determined from the value of the
  <code title="attr-dir">dir</code> attribute on the
  element. Otherwise, if the element's <code
  title="attr-dir">dir</code> attribute has the state <i>ltr</i>,
  the element's directionality is 'ltr' (left-to-right); if the
  attribute has the state <i>rtl</i>, the element's directionality
  is 'rtl' (right-to-left); and oherwise, the element's directionality
  is the same as its parent element, or 'ltr' if there is no parent
  element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-dir"><code>dir</code></dfn> DOM attribute on
  an element must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-dir">dir</code> content attribute of that element,
  <span>limited to only known values</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-dir"><code>dir</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute on <code>HTMLDocument</code> objects must
  <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-dir">dir</code> content
  attribute of <span>the <code>html</code> element</span>, if any,
  <span>limited to only known values</span>. If there is no such
  element, then the attribute must return the empty string and do
  nothing on setting.</p>

  <p class="note">Authors are strongly encouraged to use the <code
  title="attr-dir">dir</code> attribute to indicate text direction
  rather than using CSS, since that way their documents will continue
  to render correctly even in the absence of CSS (e.g. as interpreted
  by search engines).</p>


  <h5 id="classes">The <dfn title="attr-class"><code>class</code></dfn> attribute</h5>

  <p>Every <span title="HTML elements">HTML element</span> may have a
  <code title="attr-class">class</code> attribute specified.</p>

  <p>The attribute, if specified, must have a value that is an
  <span>unordered set of unique space-separated tokens</span>
  representing the various classes that the element belongs to.</p>

  <p>The classes that an <span title="HTML elements">HTML
  element</span> has assigned to it consists of all the classes
  returned when the value of the <code title="attr-class">class</code>
  attribute is <span title="split a string on spaces">split on
  spaces</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">Assigning classes to an element affects class
  matching in selectors in CSS, the <code
  title="dom-document-getElementsByClassName">getElementsByClassName()</code>
  method in the DOM, and other such features.</p>

  <p>Authors may use any value in the <code
  title="attr-class">class</code> attribute, but are encouraged to use
  the values that describe the nature of the content, rather than
  values that describe the desired presentation of the
  content.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-className"><code>className</code></dfn> and
  <dfn title="dom-classList"><code>classList</code></dfn> DOM
  attributes must both <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-class">class</code> content attribute.</p>



  <h5>The <dfn title="attr-style"><code>style</code></dfn> attribute</h5>

  <p>All elements may have the <code title="attr-style">style</code>
  content attribute set. If specified, the attribute must contain only
  a list of zero or more semicolon-separated (;) CSS declarations. <a
  href="#refsCSS21">[CSS21]</a></p>

  <p>In user agents that support CSS, the attribute's value must be
  parsed when the attribute is added or has its value changed, with
  its value treated as the body (the part inside the curly brackets)
  of a declaration block in a rule whose selector matches just the
  element on which the attribute is set. All <span
  title="URL">URLs</span> in the value must be <span title="resolve a
  url">resolved</span> relative to the element when the attribute is
  parsed.<!-- so dynamic changes to the base URL don't affect the CSS
  --> For the purposes of the CSS cascade, the attribute must be
  considered to be a 'style' attribute at the author level. </p>

  <p>Documents that use <code title="attr-style">style</code>
  attributes on any of their elements must still be comprehensible and
  usable if those attributes were removed.</p>

  <p class="note">In particular, using the <code
  title="attr-style">style</code> attribute to hide and show content,
  or to convey meaning that is otherwise not included in the document,
  is non-conforming.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-style"><code>style</code></dfn> DOM attribute
  must return a <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> whose value
  represents the declarations specified in the attribute, if
  present. Mutating the <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> object must
  create a <code title="attr-font-style">style</code> attribute on the
  element (if there isn't one already) and then change its value to be
  a value representing the serialized form of the
  <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> object. <a
  href="#refsCSSOM">[CSSOM]</a>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the words that refer to colors are
   marked up using the <code>span</code> element and the <code
   title="attr-style">style</code> attribute to make those words show
   up in the relevant colors in visual media.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>My sweat suit is &lt;span style="color: green; background:
transparent">green&lt;/span> and my eyes are &lt;span style="color: blue;
background: transparent">blue&lt;/span>.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>



  <h5><dfn>Embedding custom non-visible data</dfn></h5>

  <p>A <dfn>custom data attribute</dfn> is an attribute whose name
  starts with the string "<dfn
  title="attr-data-*"><code>data-</code></dfn>", has at least one
  character after the hyphen, is <span>XML-compatible</span>, has no
  namespace, and contains no characters in the range U+0041 .. U+005A
  (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A .. LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z).</p>

  <p class="note">All attributes in <span>HTML documents</span> get
  lowercased automatically, so the restriction on uppercase letters
  doesn't affect such documents.</p>

  <p><span title="custom data attribute">Custom data attributes</span>
  are intended to store custom data private to the page or
  application, for which there are no more appropriate attributes or
  elements.</p>

  <p>These attributes are not intended for use by software that is
  independent of the site that uses the attributes.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For instance, a site about music could annotate list items
   representing tracks in an album with custom data attributes
   containing the length of each track. This information could then be
   used by the site itself to allow the user to sort the list by track
   length, or to filter the list for tracks of certain lengths.</p>

   <pre>&lt;ol>
 &lt;li data-length="2m11s">Beyond The Sea&lt;/li>
 ...
&lt;/ol></pre>

   <p>It would be inappropriate, however, for the user to use generic
   software not associated with that music site to search for tracks
   of a certain length by looking at this data.</p>

   <p>This is because these attributes are intended for use by the
   site's own scripts, and are not a generic extension mechanism for
   publicly-usable metadata.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Every <span title="HTML elements">HTML element</span> may have
  any number of <span title="custom data attribute">custom data
  attributes</span> specified, with any value.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-dataset"><code>dataset</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute provides convenient accessors for all the <code
  title="attr-data-*">data-*</code> attributes on an element.  On
  getting, the <code title="dom-dataset">dataset</code> DOM attribute
  must return a <code>DOMStringMap</code> object, associated with the
  following algorithms, which expose these attributes on their
  element:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>The algorithm for getting the list of name-value pairs</dt>

   <dd>
    <ol>

     <li>Let <var title="">list</var> be an empty list of name-value
     pairs.</li>

     <li>For each content attribute on the element whose first five
     characters are the string "<code title="">data-</code>", add a
     name-value pair to <var title="">list</var> whose name is the
     attribute's name with the first five character removed and whose
     value is the attribute's value.</li>

     <li>Return <var title="">list</var>.</li>

    </ol>
   </dd>

   <dt>The algorithm for setting names to certain values</dt>

   <dd>
    <ol>

     <li>Let <var title="">name</var> be the concatenation of the
     string <code title="">data-</code> and the name passed to the
     algorithm.</li>

     <li>Let <var title="">value</var> be the value passed to the
     algorithm.</li>

     <li>Set the value of the attribute with the name <var
     title="">name</var>, to the value <var title="">value</var>,
     replacing any previous value if the attribute already existed. If
     <code title="">setAttribute()</code> would have raised an
     exception when setting an attribute with the name <var
     title="">name</var>, then this must raise the same
     exception.</li>

    </ol>
   </dd>

   <dt>The algorithm for deleting names</dt>

   <dd>
    <ol>

     <li>Let <var title="">name</var> be the concatenation of the
     string <code title="">data-</code> and the name passed to the
     algorithm.</li>

     <li>Remove the attribute with the name <var title="">name</var>,
     if such an attribute exists. Do nothing otherwise.</li>

    </ol>
   </dd>

  </dl>

  <div class="example">

   <p>If a Web page wanted an element to represent a space ship,
   e.g. as part of a game, it would have to use the <code
   class="attr-class">class</code> attribute along with <code
   title="attr-data-*">data-*</code> attributes:</p>

   <pre>
&lt;div class="spaceship" data-id="92432"
     data-weapons="laser 2" data-shields="50%"
     data-x="30" data-y="10" data-z="90">
 &lt;button class="fire"
         onclick="spaceships[this.parentNode.dataset.id].fire()">
  Fire
 &lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
</pre>

  </div>

  <p>Authors should carefully design such extensions so that when the
  attributes are ignored and any associated CSS dropped, the page is
  still usable.</p>

  <p>User agents must not derive any implementation behavior from
  these attributes or values. Specifications intended for user agents
  must not define these attributes to have any meaningful values.</p>



  <h3>Content models</h3>

  <p>All the elements in this specification have a defined content
  model, which describes what nodes are allowed inside the elements,
  and thus what the structure of an HTML document or fragment must
  look like.</p>

  <p class="note">As noted in the conformance and terminology
  sections, for the purposes of determining if an element matches its
  content model or not, <span title="text
  node"><code>CDATASection</code> nodes in the DOM are treated as
  equivalent to <code>Text</code> nodes</span>, and <a
  href="#entity-references">entity reference nodes are treated as if
  they were expanded in place</a>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="space character">space characters</span> are
  always allowed between elements. User agents represent these
  characters between elements in the source markup as text nodes in
  the DOM.<!-- not a conf criteria since the parser now requires this
  --> Empty <span title="text node">text nodes</span> and <span
  title="text node">text nodes</span> consisting of just sequences of
  those characters are considered <dfn>inter-element
  whitespace</dfn>.</p>

  <p><span>Inter-element whitespace</span>, comment nodes, and
  processing instruction nodes must be ignored when establishing
  whether an element matches its content model or not, and must be
  ignored when following algorithms that define document and element
  semantics.</p>

  <p>An element <var title="">A</var> is said to be <dfn>preceded or
  followed</dfn> by a second element <var title="">B</var> if <var
  title="">A</var> and <var title="">B</var> have the same parent node
  and there are no other element nodes or text nodes (other than
  <span>inter-element whitespace</span>) between them.</p>

  <p>Authors must not use <span>elements in the HTML namespace</span>
  anywhere except where they are explicitly allowed, as defined for
  each element, or as explicitly required by other specifications. For
  XML compound documents, these contexts could be inside elements from
  other namespaces, if those elements are defined as providing the
  relevant contexts.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The Atom specification defines the Atom <code
   title="">content</code> element, when its <code
   title="">type</code> attribute has the value <code
   title="">xhtml</code>, as requiring that it contains a single HTML
   <code>div</code> element. Thus, a <code>div</code> element is
   allowed in that context, even though this is not explicitly
   normatively stated by this specification. <a
   href="#refsATOM">[ATOM]</a></p>
  </div>

  <p>In addition, <span>elements in the HTML namespace</span> may be
  orphan nodes (i.e. without a parent node).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, creating a <code>td</code> element and storing it
   in a global variable in a script is conforming, even though
   <code>td</code> elements are otherwise only supposed to be used
   inside <code>tr</code> elements.</p>

   <pre>var data = {
  name: "Banana",
  cell: document.createElement('td'), 
};</pre>

  </div>


  <h4>Kinds of content</h4>

  <p>Each element in HTML falls into zero or more categories that
  group elements with similar characteristics together. The following
  broad categories are used in this specification:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li><span>Metadata content</span></li>
   <li><span>Flow content</span></li>
   <li><span>Sectioning content</span></li>
   <li><span>Heading content</span></li>
   <li><span>Phrasing content</span></li>
   <li><span>Embedded content</span></li>
   <li><span>Interactive content</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>These categories are related as follows:

  <p><object width="512" height="288"
  data="images/content-venn.svg"><img src="images/content-venn.png"
  alt="Sectioning content, heading content, phrasing content, and
  embedded content are all types of flow content. Embedded content is
  also a type of phrasing content."></object></p>

  <p>In addition, certain elements are categorised as <span
  title="form-associated element">form-associated elements</span> and
  further subcategorised so so to define their role in various
  form-related processing models.</p>

  <!-- XXX list all the elements for each kind of element in the
  sections below and in a summary table at the end of the document -->

  <p>Some elements have unique requirements and do not fit into any
  particular category.</p>


  <h5>Metadata content</h5>

  <p><dfn>Metadata content</dfn> is content that sets up the
  presentation or behavior of the rest of the content, or that sets
  up the relationship of the document with other documents, or that
  conveys other "out of band" information.</p>

  <p>Elements from other namespaces whose semantics are primarily
  metadata-related (e.g. RDF) are also <span>metadata
  content</span>.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Thus, in the XML serialisation, one can use RDF, like this:</p>

   <pre>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:r="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
 &lt;head>
  &lt;title>Hedral's Home Page&lt;/title>
  &lt;r:RDF>
   &lt;Person xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#"
           r:about="http://hedral.example.com/#">
    &lt;fullName>Cat Hedral&lt;/fullName>
    &lt;mailbox r:resource="mailto:hedral@damowmow.com"/>
    &lt;personalTitle>Sir&lt;/personalTitle> 
   &lt;/Person>
  &lt;/r:RDF>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
  &lt;h1>My home page&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>I like playing with string, I guess. Sister says squirrels are fun

   <p>This isn't possible in the HTML serialisation, however.</p>

  </div>


  <h5>Flow content</h5>

  <p>Most elements that are used in the body of documents and
  applications are categorized as <dfn>flow content</dfn>.</p>

  <p>As a general rule, elements whose content model allows any
  <span>flow content</span> should have either at least one descendant
  <span>text node</span> that is not <span>inter-element
  whitespace</span>, or at least one descendant element node that is
  <span>embedded content</span>. For the purposes of this requirement,
  <code>del</code> elements and their descendants must not be counted
  as contributing to the ancestors of the <code>del</code>
  element.</p>

  <p>This requirement is not a hard requirement, however, as there are
  many cases where an element can be empty legitimately, for example
  when it is used as a placeholder which will later be filled in by a
  script, or when the element is part of a template and would on most
  pages be filled in but on some pages is not relevant.</p>


  <h5>Sectioning content</h5>

  <p><dfn>Sectioning content</dfn> is content that defines the scope
  of <span title="heading content">headers</span>, <span
  title="footer">footers</span>, and <span title="address">contact
  information</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>sectioning content</span> element potentially has a
  heading and an <span>outline</span>. See the section on
  <span>headings and sections</span> for further details.</p>

  <p class="note">There are also certain elements that are <span
  title="sectioning root">sectioning roots</span>. These are distinct
  from <span>sectioning content</span>, but they can also have an
  <span>outline</span>.</p>


  <h5>Heading content</h5>

  <p><dfn>Heading content</dfn> defines the header of a section
  (whether explicitly marked up using <span>sectioning content</span>
  elements, or implied by the heading content itself).</p>


  <h5>Phrasing content</h5>

  <p><dfn>Phrasing content</dfn> is the text of the document, as well
  as elements that mark up that text at the intra-paragraph
  level. Runs of <span>phrasing content</span> form <span
  title="paragraph">paragraphs</span>.</p>

  <p>As a general rule, elements whose content model allows any
  <span>phrasing content</span> should have either at least one
  descendant <span>text node</span> that is not <span>inter-element
  whitespace</span>, or at least one descendant element node that is
  <span>embedded content</span>. For the purposes of this requirement,
  nodes that are descendants of <code>del</code> elements must not be
  counted as contributing to the ancestors of the <code>del</code>
  element.</p>

  <p class="note">Most elements that are categorized as phrasing
  content can only contain elements that are themselves categorized as
  phrasing content, not any flow content.</p>

  <p><span title="text node">Text nodes</span> that are not
  <span>inter-element whitespace</span> are <span>phrasing
  content</span>.</p>


  <h5>Embedded content</h5>

  <p><dfn>Embedded content</dfn> is content that imports another
  resource into the document, or content from another vocabulary that
  is inserted into the document.</p>

  <p>Elements that are from namespaces other than the <span>HTML
  namespace</span> and that convey content but not metadata, are
  <span>embedded content</span> for the purposes of the content models
  defined in this specification. (For example, MathML, or SVG.)</p>

  <p>Some embedded content elements can have <dfn>fallback
  content</dfn>: content that is to be used when the external resource
  cannot be used (e.g. because it is of an unsupported format). The
  element definitions state what the fallback is, if any.</p>


  <h5>Interactive content</h5>

  <p><dfn>Interactive content</dfn> is content that is specifically
  intended for user interaction.</p>

  <p>Certain elements in HTML have an <span>activation
  behavior</span>, which means the user agent should allow the user to
  manually trigger them in some way, for instance using keyboard or
  voice input, or through mouse clicks. When the user triggers an
  element with a defined <span>activation behavior</span> in a manner
  other than clicking it, the default action of the interaction
  event<!-- XXX --> must be to <span>run synthetic click activation
  steps</span> on the element.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>run synthetic click activation
  steps</dfn> on an element, the user agent must <span>run pre-click
  activation steps</span> on the element, then <span>fire a <code
  title="event-click">click</code> event</span> at the element. The
  default action of this <span title="event-click">click</span> event
  must be to <span>run post-click activation steps</span> on the
  element. If the event is canceled, the user agent must <span>run
  canceled activation steps</span> on the element instead.</p>

  <p>Given an element <var title="">target</var>, the <dfn>nearest
  activatable element</dfn> is the element returned by the following
  algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If <var title="">target</var> has a defined <span>activation
   behavior</span>, then return <var title="">target</var> and abort
   these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">target</var> has a parent element, then set
   <var title="">target</var> to that parent element and return to the
   first step.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, there is no <span>nearest activatable
   element</span>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When a pointing device is clicked, the user agent must run these
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">e</var> be the <span title="">nearest
   activatable element</span> of the element designated by the user,
   if any.</p></li>

   <li><p>If there is an element <var title="">e</var>, <span>run
   pre-click activation steps</span> on it.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Dispatching the required <code title="event-click">click</code>
    event.</p>

    <p class="XXX">Another specification presumably requires the
    firing of the <span title="event-click">click</span> event?</p>

    <p>If there is an element <var title="">e</var>, then the default
    action of the <span title="event-click">click</span> event must be
    to <span>run post-click activation steps</span> on element <var
    title="">e</var>.</p>

    <p>If there is an element <var title="">e</var> but the event is
    canceled, the user agent must <span>run canceled activation
    steps</span> on element <var title="">e</var>.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>  

  <p class="note">The above doesn't happen for arbitrary synthetic
  events dispatched by author script. However, the <code
  title="dom-click">click()</code> method can be used to make it
  happen programmatically.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>run post-click activation
  steps</dfn> on an element, the user agent must <span>fire a simple
  event</span> called <code
  title="event-DOMActivate">DOMActivate</code> at that element. The
  default action of this event must be to <span>run final activation
  steps</span> on that element. If the event is canceled, the user
  agent must <span>run canceled activation steps</span> on the element
  instead.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>run pre-click activation steps</dfn>
  on an element, it must run the <dfn>pre-click activation steps</dfn>
  defined for that element, if any.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>run canceled activation steps</dfn>
  on an element, it must run the <dfn>canceled activation steps</dfn>
  defined for that element, if any.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>run final activation steps</dfn> on
  an element, it must run the <dfn>activation behavior</dfn> defined
  for that element. Activation behaviors can refer to the <code
  title="event-click">click</code> and <code
  title="event-DOMActivate">DOMActivate</code> events that were fired
  by the steps above leading up to this point.</p>



  <h4>Transparent content models</h4>

  <p>Some elements are described as <dfn>transparent</dfn>; they have
  "transparent" as their content model. Some elements are described as
  <dfn>semi-transparent</dfn>; this means that part of their content
  model is "transparent" but that is not the only part of the content
  model that must be satisfied.</p>

  <p>When a content model includes a part that is "transparent", those
  parts must not contain content that would not be conformant if all
  transparent and semi-transparent elements in the tree were replaced,
  in their parent element, by the children in the "transparent" part
  of their content model, retaining order.</p>

  <p>When a transparent or semi-transparent element has no parent,
  then the part of its content model that is "transparent" must
  instead be treated as accepting any <span>flow content</span>.</p>


  <h3>Paragraphs</h3>

  <p>A <dfn>paragraph</dfn> is typically a block of text with one or more
  sentences that discuss a particular topic, as in typography, but can
  also be used for more general thematic grouping. For instance, an
  address is also a paragraph, as is a part of a form, a byline, or a
  stanza in a poem.</p>

  <p>Paragraphs in <span>flow content</span> are defined relative to
  what the document looks like without the <code>a</code>,
  <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements complicating matters,
  since those elements, with their hybrid content models, can straddle
  paragraph boundaries.</p>

  <p>Let <var title="">view</var> be a view of the DOM that replaces
  all <code>a</code>, <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements
  in the document with their contents. Then, in <var
  title="">view</var>, for each run of <span>phrasing content</span>
  uninterrupted by other types of content, in an element that accepts
  content other than <span>phrasing content</span>, let <var
  title="">first</var> be the first node of the run, and let <var
  title="">last</var> be the last node of the run. For each run, a
  paragraph exists in the original DOM from immediately before <var
  title="">first</var> to immediately after <var
  title="">last</var>. (Paragraphs can thus span across
  <code>a</code>, <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements.)</p>

  <p>A <span>paragraph</span> is also formed explicitly by
  <code>p</code> elements.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>p</code> element can be used to wrap
  individual paragraphs when there would otherwise not be any content
  other than phrasing content to separate the paragraphs from each
  other.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, there are two paragraphs in a
   section. There is also a header, which contains phrasing content
   that is not a paragraph. Note how the comments and
   <span>intra-element whitespace</span> do not form paragraphs.</p>

   <pre>&lt;section>
  &lt;h1>Example of paragraphs&lt;/h1>
  This is the &lt;em>first&lt;/em> paragraph in this example.
  &lt;p>This is the second.&lt;/p>
  &lt;!-- This is not a paragraph. -->
&lt;/section></pre>

   <p>The following example takes that markup and puts
   <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements around some of the
   markup to show that the text was changed (though in this case, the
   changes don't really make much sense, admittedly). Notice how this
   example has exactly the same paragraphs as the previous one,
   despite the <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements.</p>

   <pre>&lt;section>
  &lt;ins>&lt;h1>Example of paragraphs&lt;/h1>
  This is the &lt;em>first&lt;/em> paragraph in&lt;/ins> this example&lt;del>.
  &lt;p>This is the second.&lt;/p>&lt;/del>
  &lt;!-- This is not a paragraph. -->
&lt;/section></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the link spans half of the first
   paragraph, all of the header separating the two paragraphs, and
   half of the second paragraph.</p>

   <pre>&lt;aside>
 Welcome!
 &lt;a href="about.html">
  This is home of...
  &lt;h1>The Falcons!&lt;/h1>
  The Lockheed Martin multirole jet fighter aircraft!
 &lt;/a>
 This page discusses the F-16 Fighting Falcon's innermost secrets.
&lt;/aside></pre>

   <p>Here is another way of marking this up, this time showing the
   paragraphs explicitly, and splitting the one link element into
   three:</p>

   <pre>&lt;aside>
 &lt;p>Welcome! &lt;a href="about.html">This is home of...&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
 &lt;h1>&lt;a href="about.html">The Falcons!&lt;/a>&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="about.html">The Lockheed Martin multirole jet
 fighter aircraft!&lt;/a> This page discusses the F-16 Fighting
 Falcon's innermost secrets.&lt;/p>
&lt;/aside></pre>

  </div>

  <p class="note">Generally, having elements straddle paragraph
  boundaries is best avoided. Maintaining such markup can be
  difficult.</p>


  <h3>APIs in HTML documents</h3>

  <p>For <span>HTML documents</span>, and for <span>HTML
  elements</span> in <span>HTML documents</span>, certain APIs defined
  in DOM3 Core become case-insensitive or case-changing, as sometimes
  defined in DOM3 Core, and as summarized or required below. <a
  href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a>.</p>

  <p>This does not apply to <span>XML documents</span> or to elements
  that are not in the <span>HTML namespace</span> despite being in
  <span>HTML documents</span>.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><code title="">Element.tagName</code> and <code
   title="">Node.nodeName</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>These attributes must return element names <span>converted to
    uppercase</span>, regardless of the case with which they were
    created.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Document.createElement()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The canonical form of HTML markup is all-lowercase; thus, this
    method will <span title="converted to lowercase">lowercase</span>
    the argument before creating the requisite element. Also, the
    element created must be in the <span>HTML namespace</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">This doesn't apply to <code
    title="">Document.createElementNS()</code>. Thus, it is possible,
    by passing this last method a tag name in the wrong case, to
    create an element that claims to have the tag name of an element
    defined in this specification, but doesn't support its interfaces,
    because it really has another tag name not accessible from the DOM
    APIs.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Element.setAttributeNode()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When an <code>Attr</code> node is set on an <span title="HTML
    elements">HTML element</span>, it must have its name
    <span>converted to lowercase</span> before the element is
    affected.</p>

    <p class="note">This doesn't apply to <code
    title="">Document.setAttributeNodeNS()</code>.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Element.setAttribute()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When an attribute is set on an <span title="HTML elements">HTML
    element</span>, the name argument must be <span>converted to
    lowercas</span> before the element is affected.</p>

    <p class="note">This doesn't apply to <code
    title="">Document.setAttributeNS()</code>.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Document.getElementsByTagName()</code> and <code
   title="">Element.getElementsByTagName()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>These methods (but not their namespaced counterparts) must
    compare the given argument in an <span>ASCII
    case-insensitive</span> manner when looking at <span title="HTML
    elements">HTML elements</span>, and in a
    <span>case-sensitive</span> manner otherwise.</p>

    <p class="note">Thus, in an <span title="HTML documents">HTML
    document</span> with nodes in multiple namespaces, these methods
    will be both case-sensitive and case-insensitive at the same
    time.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><code title="">Document.renameNode()</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If the new namespace is the <span>HTML namespace</span>, then
    the new qualified name must be <span>converted to lowercase</span>
    before the rename takes place.</p>

   </dd>
   

  </dl>



  <h3><dfn>Dynamic markup insertion</dfn></h3>

  <p class="note">APIs for dynamically inserting markup into the
  document interact with the parser, and thus their behavior, varies
  depending on whether they are used with <span>HTML documents</span>
  (and the <span>HTML parser</span>) or XHTML in <span>XML
  documents</span> (and the <span>XML parser</span>).</p>

  <!-- XXX must make sure we spec that innerHTML et al causes mutation
  events to fire, but document.write() doesn't. (the latter is already
  req-stated in the parser section, btw) -->



  <h4>Controlling the input stream</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-open"><code>open()</code></dfn>
  method comes in several variants with different numbers of
  arguments.</p>

  <p>When called with two or fewer arguments, the method must act as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">type</var> be the value of the first
   argument, if there is one, or "<code>text/html</code>"
   otherwise.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">replace</var> be true if there is a second
   argument and it is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for
   the value "replace", and false otherwise.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the document has an <span>active parser</span><!-- XXX xref
    --> that isn't a <span>script-created parser</span>, and the
    <span>insertion point</span> associated with that parser's
    <span>input stream</span> is not undefined (that is, it
    <em>does</em> point to somewhere in the input stream), then the
    method does nothing. Abort these steps and return the
    <code>Document</code> object on which the method was invoked.</p>

    <p class="note">This basically causes <code
    title="dom-document-open">document.open()</code> to be ignored
    when it's called in an inline script found during the parsing of
    data sent over the network, while still letting it have an effect
    when called asynchronously or on a document that is itself being
    spoon-fed using these APIs.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p><span title="unload a document">Unload</span> the
   <code>Document</code> object, with the <var title="">recycle</var>
   parameter set to true. If the user <span>refused to allow the
   document to be unloaded</span>, then these steps must be
   aborted.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the document has an <span>active parser</span><!--XXX
   xref-->, then stop that parser, and throw away any pending content
   in the input stream. <span class="XXX">what about if it
   doesn't, because it's either like a text/plain, or Atom, or PDF, or
   XHTML, or image document, or something?</span></p></li><!-- XXX see
   also innerHTML in HTML -->

   <li><p>Unregister all event listeners registered on the
   <code>Document</code> node and its descendants.</p>

   <li><p>Remove all child nodes of the document, without firing any
   mutation events.</p></li>

   <li><p>Replace the <code>Document</code>'s singleton objects with
   new instances of those objects. (This includes in particular the
   <code>Window</code>, <code>Location</code>, <code>History</code>,
   <code>ApplicationCache</code>, <code>UndoManager</code>,
   <code>Navigator</code>, and <code>Selection</code> objects, the
   various <code>BarProp</code> objects, the two <code>Storage</code>
   objects, and the various <code>HTMLCollection</code> objects. It
   also includes all the WebIDL prototypes in the ECMAScript binding,

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">replace</var> is false, then:

    <ol>

     <li>Remove all the entries in the <span>browsing context</span>'s
     <span>session history</span> after the <span>current entry</span>
     in its <code>Document</code>'s <code>History</code> object</li>

     <li>Remove any earlier entries that share the same
     <code>Document</code></li>

     <li>Add a new entry just before the last entry that is associated
     with the text that was parsed by the previous parser associated
     with the <code>Document</code> object, as well as the state of
     the document at the start of these steps. (This allows the user
     to step backwards in the session history to see the page before
     it was blown away by the <code
     title="dom-document-open">document.open()</code> call.)</li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Finally, set the <span>insertion point</span> to point at
   just before the end of the <span>input stream</span> (which at this
   point will be empty).</p></li>

   <li><p>Return the <code>Document</code> on which the method was
   invoked.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When called with three or more arguments, the <code
  title="dom-document-open">open()</code> method on the
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> object must call the <code
  title="dom-open">open()</code> method on the <code>Window</code>
  object of the <code>HTMLDocument</code> object, with the same
  arguments as the original call to the <code
  title="dom-document-open">open()</code> method, and return whatever
  that method returned. If the <code>HTMLDocument</code> object has no
  <code>Window</code> object, then the method must raise an
  <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-close"><code>close()</code></dfn>
  method must do nothing if there is no <span>script-created
  parser</span> associated with the document. If there is such a
  parser, then, when the method is called, the user agent must insert
  an <span>explicit "EOF" character</span> at the end of the parser's
  <span>input stream</span>.</p>




  <h4><code title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code></h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-write"><code>document.write(...)</code></dfn>
  method must act as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the method was invoked on an <span title="XML documents">XML
    document</span>, throw an <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code>
    exception and abort these steps.</p>

    <!--
    Where would document.write() insert?
    Consider: data:text/xml,<script xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><![CDATA[ document.write('<foo>Test</foo>'); ]]></script>
    -->

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <span>insertion point</span> is undefined, the <code
    title="dom-document-open">open()</code> method must be called
    (with no arguments) on the <code title="Document">document</code>
    object. If the user <span>refused to allow the document to be
    unloaded</span>, then these steps must be aborted. Otherwise, the
    <span>insertion point</span> will point at just before the end of
    the (empty) <span>input stream</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The string consisting of the concatenation of all the arguments
    to the method must be inserted into the <span>input
    stream</span><!-- XXX xref --> just before the <span>insertion
    point</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If there is a <span>pending external script</span>, then the
    method must now return without further processing of the
    <span>input stream</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, the tokeniser must process the characters that were
    inserted, one at a time, processing resulting tokens as they are
    emitted, and stopping when the tokeniser reaches the insertion
    point or when the processing of the tokeniser is aborted by the
    tree construction stage (this can happen if a <code>script</code>
    end tag token is emitted by the tokeniser).

    <p class="note">If the <code
    title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> method was
    called from script executing inline (i.e. executing because the
    parser parsed a set of <code>script</code> tags), then this is a
    <a href="#nestedParsing">reentrant invocation of the
    parser</a>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Finally, the method must return.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>


  <h4><code title="dom-document-writeln">document.writeln()</code></h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-writeln"><code>document.writeln(...)</code></dfn>
  method, when invoked, must act as if the <code
  title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> method had been
  invoked with the same argument(s), plus an extra argument consisting
  of a string containing a single line feed character (U+000A).</p>




  <h4><code title="dom-innerHTML">innerHTML</code></h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-innerHTML"><code>innerHTML</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute represents the markup of the node's contents.</p>

  <p>On getting, if the node's document is an <span title="HTML
  documents">HTML document</span>, then the attribute must return the
  result of running the <span>HTML fragment serialization
  algorithm</span> on the node; otherwise, the node's document is an
  <span title="XML documents">XML document</span>, and the attribute
  must return the result of running the <span>XML fragment
  serialization algorithm</span> on the node instead (this might raise
  an exception instead of returning a string).</p>

  <p>On setting, the following steps must be run:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the node's document is an <span title="HTML documents">HTML
    document</span>: Invoke the <span>HTML fragment parsing
    algorithm</span>.</p>

    <p>If the node's document is an <span title="XML documents">XML
    document</span>: Invoke the <span>XML fragment parsing
    algorithm</span>.</p>

    <p>In either case, the algorithm must be invoked with the string
    being assigned into the <code
    title="dom-innerHTML">innerHTML</code> attribute as the <var
    title="">input</var>. If the node is an <code>Element</code>
    node, then, in addition, that element must be passed as the <var
    title="">context</var> element.</p>

    <p>If this raises an exception, then abort these steps.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, let <var title="">new children</var> be the nodes
    returned.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the attribute is being set on a <code>Document</code> node,
    and that document has an active <span>HTML parser</span> or
    <span>XML parser</span>, then stop that parser.</p>

    <p class="XXX">what about if it doesn't, because it's either
    like a text/plain, or Atom, or PDF, or XHTML, or image document,
    or something?</p><!-- XXX see also document.open() -->

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Remove the child nodes of the node whose <code
    title="dom-innerHTML">innerHTML</code> attribute is being set.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the attribute is being set on a <code>Document</code>
    node, let <var title="">target document</var> be that
    <code>Document</code> node. Otherwise, the attribute is being
    set on an <code>Element</code> node; let <var title="">target
    document</var> be the <code title="">ownerDocument</code> of
    that <code>Element</code>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Set the <code title="">ownerDocument</code> of all the nodes in
    <var title="">new children</var> to the <var title="">target
    document</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Append all the <var title="">new children</var> nodes to the
    node whose <code title="dom-innerHTML">innerHTML</code> attribute
    is being set, preserving their order, without firing any mutation
    events.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>



  <h4><code title="dom-outerHTML">outerHTML</code></h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-outerHTML"><code>outerHTML</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute represents the markup of the element and its contents.</p>

  <p>On getting, if the node's document is an <span title="HTML
  documents">HTML document</span>, then the attribute must return the
  result of running the <span>HTML fragment serialization
  algorithm</span> on a fictional node whose only child is the node on
  which the attribute was invoked; otherwise, the node's document is
  an <span title="XML documents">XML document</span>, and the
  attribute must return the result of running the <span>XML fragment
  serialization algorithm</span> on that fictional node instead (this
  might raise an exception instead of returning a string).</p>

  <p>On setting, the following steps must be run:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">target</var> be the element whose <code
    title="dom-outerHTML">outerHTML</code> attribute is being
    set.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">target</var> has no parent node, then abort
    these steps. There would be no way to obtain a reference to the
    nodes created even if the remaining steps were run.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">target</var>'s parent node is a
    <code>Document</code> object, throw a
    <code>NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR</code> exception and abort these
    steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">parent</var> be <var title="">target</var>'s
    parent node, unless that is a <code>DocumentFragment</code> node,
    in which case let <var title="">parent</var> be an arbitrary
    <code>body</code> element.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">target</var>'s document is an <span
    title="HTML documents">HTML document</span>: Invoke the <span>HTML
    fragment parsing algorithm</span>.</p>

    <p>If <var title="">target</var>'s document is an <span title="XML
    documents">XML document</span>: Invoke the <span>XML fragment
    parsing algorithm</span>.</p>

    <p>In either case, the algorithm must be invoked with the string
    being assigned into the <code
    title="dom-outerHTML">outerHTML</code> attribute as the <var
    title="">input</var>, and <var title="">parent</var> as the <var
    title="">context</var> element.</p>

    <p>If this raises an exception, then abort these steps.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, let <var title="">new children</var> be <var
    title="">target</var>s returned.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Set the <code title="">ownerDocument</code> of all the nodes in
    <var title="">new children</var> to <var title="">target</var>'s
    document.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Remove <var title="">target</var> from its parent node and
    insert in its place all the <var title="">new children</var>
    nodes, preserving their order, without firing any mutation
    events.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>



  <h4><code title="dom-insertAdjacentHTML">insertAdjacentHTML()</code></h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-insertAdjacentHTML"><code>insertAdjacentHTML(<var
  title="">position</var>, <var title="">text</var>)</code></dfn>
  method, when invoked, must run the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">position</var> and <var title="">text</var>
    be the method's first and second arguments, respectively.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">target</var> be the element on which the
    method was invoked.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Use the first matching item from this list:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt>If <var title="">position</var> is an <span>ASCII

     <dd>

      <p>If <var title="">target</var> has no parent node, then abort
      these steps.</p>

      <p>If <var title="">target</var>'s parent node is a
      <code>Document</code> object, then throw a
      <code>NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR</code> exception and abort
      these steps.

      <p>Otherwise, let <var title="">context</var> be the parent node
      of <var title="">target</var>.</p>

     <dt>Otherwise</dt>

     <dd>

      <p>Throw a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">target</var>'s document is an <span

    <p>In either case, the algorithm must be invoked with <var

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>html</code> element <span>represents</span> the root of
  an HTML document.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-html-manifest"><code>manifest</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the address of the document's <span>application
  cache</span> <span
  title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span>, if there is
  one. If the attribute is present, the attribute's value must be a
  <span>valid URL</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code> attribute
  only <span title="concept-appcache-init">has an effect</span> during
  the early stages of document load. Changing the attribute
  dynamically thus has no effect (and thus, no DOM API is provided for
  this attribute).</p>

  <p class="note">For the purposes of <span
  title="concept-appcache-init">application cache selection</span>,
  later <code>base</code> elements cannot affect the <span
  title="resolve a url">resolving of relative URLs</span> in <code
  title="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code> attributes, as the
  attributes are processed before those elements are seen.</p>

  <p>The <code>title</code> element <span>represents</span> the
  document's title or name. Authors should use titles that identify
  their documents even when they are used out of context, for example
  in a user's history or bookmarks, or in search results. The
  document's title is often different from its first header, since the
  first header does not have to stand alone when taken out of
  context.</p>

  <p>There must be no more than one <code>title</code> element per
  document.</p>

  <p>The <code>title</code> element must not contain any
  elements.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here are some examples of appropriate titles, contrasted with
   the top-level headers that might be used on those same pages.</p>

   <pre>  &lt;title>Introduction to The Mating Rituals of Bees&lt;/title>

  &lt;h1>Introduction&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>This companion guide to the highly successful
  &lt;cite>Introduction to Medieval Bee-Keeping&lt;/cite> book is...
</pre>

   <p>The next page might be a part of the same site. Note how the
   title describes the subject matter unambiguously, while the first
   header assumes the reader knowns what the context is and therefore
   won't wonder if the dances are Salsa or Waltz:</p>

   <pre>  &lt;title>Dances used during bee mating rituals&lt;/title>
    ...
  &lt;h1>The Dances&lt;/h1></pre>

  </div>

  <p>The string to use as the document's title is given by the <code

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-base-href"><code>href</code></dfn> content
  attribute, if specified, must contain a <span>valid URL</span>.</p>

  <p>A <code>base</code> element, if it has an <code

    by this element, the <span>styling processing model</span> defines
    how. <a href="#refsCSSOM">[CSSOM]</a></p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>link</code> element allows authors to link their
  document to other resources.</p>

  <p>The destination of the link(s) is given by the <dfn
  title="attr-link-href"><code>href</code></dfn> attribute, which must
  be present and must contain a <span>valid URL</span>. If the <code
  title="attr-link-href">href</code> attribute is absent, then the
  element does not define a link.</p>

  <p>The types of link indicated (the relationships) are given by the
  value of the <dfn title="attr-link-rel"><code>rel</code></dfn>
  attribute, which must be present, and must have a value that is a
  <span>set of space-separated tokens</span>. The <a
  href="#linkTypes">allowed values and their meanings</a> are defined
  in a later section. If the <code title="attr-link-rel">rel</code>
  attribute is absent, or if the values used are not allowed according
  to the definitions in this specification, then the element does not
  define a link.</p>

  <p>Two categories of links can be created using the
  <code>link</code> element. <dfn title="external resource link">Links
  to external resources</dfn> are links to resources that are to be
  used to augment the current document, and <dfn title="hyperlink
  link">hyperlink links</dfn> are <span title="hyperlink">links to
  other documents</span>. The <a href="#linkTypes">link types
  section</a> defines whether a particular link type is an external
  resource or a hyperlink. One element can create multiple links (of
  which some might be external resource links and some might be
  hyperlinks); exactly which and how many links are created depends on
  the keywords given in the <code title="attr-link-rel">rel</code>
  attribute. User agents must process the links on a per-link basis,
  not a per-element basis.</p>

  <p class="note">Each link is handled separately. For instance, if
  there are two <code>link</code> elements with <code
  title="">rel="stylesheet"</code>, they each count as a separate
  external resource, and each is affected by its own attributes
  independently.</p>

  <p>The exact behavior for links to external resources depends on the
  exact relationship, as defined for the relevant link type. Some of
  the attributes control whether or not the external resource is to be
  applied (as defined below). For external resources that are
  represented in the DOM (for example, style sheets), the DOM
  representation must be made available even if the resource is not
  applied. To obtain the resource, the user agent must <span
  title="resolve a url">resolve</span> the <span>URL</span> given by
  the <code title="attr-link-href">href</code> attribute, relative to
  the element, and then <span>fetch</span> the resulting
  <span>absolute URL</span>. User agents may opt to only
  <span>fetch</span> such resources when they are needed, instead of
  pro-actively <span title="fetch">fetching</span> all the external
  resources that are not applied.</p>

  <p>The semantics of the protocol used (e.g. HTTP) must be followed
  when fetching external resources. (For example, redirects must be
  followed and 404 responses must cause the external resource to not
  be applied.)</p>

  <p>Interactive user agents should provide users with a means to
  <span title="following hyperlinks">follow the hyperlinks</span>
  created using the <code>link</code> element, somewhere within their
  user interface. The exact interface is not defined by this
  specification, but it should include the following information
  (obtained from the element's attributes, again as defined below), in
  some form or another (possibly simplified), for each hyperlink
  created with each <code>link</code> element in the document:</p>

  <ul> <!-- the order here is the order that makes most sense for a UI -->

   <li>The relationship between this document and the resource (given
   by the <code title="attr-link-rel">rel</code> attribute)</li>

   <li>The title of the resource (given by the <code
   title="attr-link-title">title</code> attribute).</li>

   <li>The address of the resource (given by the <code
   title="attr-link-href">href</code> attribute).</li>

   <li>The language of the resource (given by the <code
   title="attr-link-hreflang">hreflang</code> attribute).</li>

   <li>The optimum media for the resource (given by the <code
   title="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute).</li>

  </ul>

  <p>User agents may also include other information, such as the type
  of the resource (as given by the <code
  title="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute).</p>

  <p class="note">Hyperlinks created with the <code>link</code>
  element and its <code title="attr-link-rel">rel</code> attribute
  apply to the whole page. This contrasts with the <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code> attribute of <code>a</code>
  and <code>area</code> elements, which indicates the type of a link
  whose context is given by the link's location within the
  document.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-media"><code>media</code></dfn>
  attribute says which media the resource applies to. The value must
  be a valid <a href="#mq">media query</a>. <a
  href="#refsMQ">[MQ]</a></p>

  <p>If the link is a <span title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>
  then the <code title="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute is
  purely advisory, and describes for which media the document in
  question was designed.</p>

  <p>However, if the link is an <span>external resource link</span>,
  then the <code title="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute is
  prescriptive. The user agent must apply the external resource to
  <span title="view">views</span> while their state match the listed
  media and the other relevant conditions apply, and must not apply
  them otherwise.</p><!-- note similar text in <style> section -->

  <p class="note">The external resource might have further
  restrictions defined within that limit its applicability. For
  example, a CSS style sheet might have some <code
  title="">@media</code> blocks. This specification does not override
  such further restrictions or requirements.</p><!-- note similar text
  in <style> section -->

  <p id="default-media">The default, if the <code
  title="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute is omitted, is
  <code>all</code>, meaning that by default links apply to all
  media.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-hreflang"><code>hreflang</code></dfn>
  attribute on the <code>link</code> element has the same semantics as
  the <span title="attr-hyperlink-hreflang"><code>hreflang</code>
  attribute on hyperlink elements</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-type"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute
  gives the MIME type of the linked resource. It is purely advisory.
  The value must be a valid MIME type, optionally with parameters. <a
  href="#refsRFC2046">[RFC2046]</a></p>

  <p>For <span title="external resource link">external resource
  links</span>, the <code title="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute
  is used as a hint to user agents so that they can avoid fetching
  resources they do not support. If the attribute is present, then the
  user agent must assume that the resource is of the given type. If
  the attribute is omitted, but the external resource link type has a
  default type defined, then the user agent must assume that the
  resource is of that type. If the UA does not support the given MIME
  type for the given link relationship, then the UA should not fetch
  the resource; if the UA does support the given MIME type for the
  given link relationship, then the UA should <span>fetch</span> the
  resource. If the attribute is omitted, and the external resource
  link type does not have a default type defined, but the user agent
  would fetch the resource if the type was known and supported, then
  the user agent should <span>fetch</span> the resource under the
  assumption that it will be supported.</p>

  <p>User agents must not consider the <code
  title="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute authoritative &mdash;
  upon fetching the resource, user agents must not use the <code
  title="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute to determine its actual
  type. Only the actual type (as defined in the next paragraph) is
  used to determine whether to <em>apply</em> the resource, not the
  aforementioned assumed type.</p>

  <p id="concept-link-type-sniffing">If the resource is expected to be
  an image, user agents may apply the <span title="Content-Type
  sniffing: image">image sniffing rules</span>, with the <var
  title="">official type</var> being the type determined from the
  resource's <span title="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span>,
  and use the resulting sniffed type of the resource as if it was the
  actual type. Otherwise, if the resource is not expected to be an
  image, or if the user agent opts not to apply those rules, then the
  user agent must use the resource's <span
  title="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span> to determine the
  type of the resource. If there is no type metadata, but the external
  resource link type has a default type defined, then the user agent
  must assume that the resource is of that type.</p>

  <p>Once the user agent has established the type of the resource, the
  user agent must apply the resource if it is of a supported type and
  the other relevant conditions apply, and must ignore the resource
  otherwise.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>If a document contains style sheet links labeled as follows:</p>

   <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="A" type="text/plain"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="B" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="C"&gt;</pre>

   <p>...then a compliant UA that supported only CSS style sheets
   would fetch the B and C files, and skip the A file (since
   <code>text/plain</code> is not the MIME type for CSS style
   sheets).</p>

   <p>For files B and C, it would then check the actual types returned
   by the server. For those that are sent as <code>text/css</code>, it
   would apply the styles, but for those labeled as
   <code>text/plain</code>, or any other type, it would not.</p>

   <p>If one the two files was returned without a
   <span>Content-Type</span> metadata, or with a syntactically
   incorrect type like <code
   title="">Content-Type:&nbsp;"null"</code>, then the default type
   for <code title="rel-stylesheet">stylesheet</code> links would kick
   in. Since that default type is <code title="">text/css</code>, the
   style sheet <em>would</em> nonetheless be applied.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-title"><code>title</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the title of the link. With one exception, it is
  purely advisory. The value is text. The exception is for style sheet
  links, where the <code title="attr-link-title">title</code>
  attribute defines <span>alternative style sheet sets</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code title="attr-link-title">title</code>
  attribute on <code>link</code> elements differs from the global
  <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute of most other
  elements in that a link without a title does not inherit the title
  of the parent element: it merely has no title.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-link-sizes">sizes</code> attribute is used
  with the <code title="rel-icon">icon</code> link type. The attribute
  must not be specified on <code>link</code> elements that do not have
  a <code title="attr-link-rel">rel</code> attribute that specifies
  the <code title="rel-icon">icon</code> keyword.</p>

  <p>Some versions of HTTP defined a <code title="">Link:</code>
  header, to be processed like a series of <code>link</code> elements.
  If supported, for the purposes of ordering links defined by HTTP
  headers must be assumed to come before any links in the document, in
  the order that they were given in the HTTP entity header.  (URIs in
  these headers are to be processed and resolved according to the
  rules given in HTTP; the rules of <em>this</em> specification don't
  apply.) <a href="#refsRFC2616">[RFC2616]</a> <a
  href="#refsRFC2068">[RFC2068]</a></p>

  <p>The DOM attributes <dfn
  title="dom-link-href"><code>href</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-link-rel"><code>rel</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-link-media"><code>media</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-link-hreflang"><code>hreflang</code></dfn>, and <dfn
  title="dom-link-type"><code>type</code></dfn>, and <dfn
  title="dom-link-sizes"><code>sizes</code></dfn> each must
  <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the same

  <p>The DOM attribute <dfn
  title="dom-link-rellist"><code>relList</code></dfn> must
  <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-link-rel">rel</code>
  content attribute.</p>

  <p>The DOM attribute <dfn
  title="dom-link-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn> only applies
  to style sheet links. When the <code>link</code> element defines a
  style sheet link, then the <code
  title="dom-link-disabled">disabled</code> attribute behaves as
  defined <span title="dom-linkstyle-disabled">for the alternative
  style sheets DOM</span>. For all other <code>link</code> elements it
  always return false and does nothing on setting.</p> <!-- that is

           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-meta-name">name</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-meta-httpEquiv">httpEquiv</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <code>meta</code> element <span>represents</span> various
  kinds of metadata that cannot be expressed using the
  <code>title</code>, <code>base</code>, <code>link</code>,
  <code>style</code>, and <code>script</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <code>meta</code> element can represent document-level
  metadata with the <code title="attr-meta-name">name</code>
  attribute, pragma directives with the <code
  title="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code> attribute, and the
  file's <span>character encoding declaration</span> when an HTML
  document is serialized to string form (e.g. for transmission over
  the network or for disk storage) with the <code
  title="attr-meta-charset">charset</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>Exactly one of the <code title="attr-meta-name">name</code>,
  <code title="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code>, and <code
  title="attr-meta-charset">charset</code> attributes must be
  specified.</p>

  <p>If either <code title="attr-meta-name">name</code> or <code
  title="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code> is specified, then
  the <code title="attr-meta-content">content</code> attribute must
  also be specified. Otherwise, it must be omitted.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-meta-charset"><code>charset</code></dfn>
  attribute specifies the character encoding used by the
  document. This is called a <span>character encoding
  declaration</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-meta-charset">charset</code> attribute may
  be specified in <span title="HTML5">HTML documents</span> only, it
  must not be used in <span title="XHTML">XML documents</span>. There
  must not be more than one element with a <code
  title="attr-meta-charset">charset</code> attribute per document.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-meta-content"><code>content</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the value of the document metadata or pragma
  directive when the element is used for those purposes. The allowed
  values depend on the exact context, as described in subsequent
  sections of this specification.</p>

  <p>If a <code>meta</code> element has a <dfn
  title="attr-meta-name"><code>name</code></dfn> attribute, it sets
  document metadata. Document metadata is expressed in terms of
  name/value pairs, the <code title="attr-meta-name">name</code>
  attribute on the <code>meta</code> element giving the name, and the
  <code title="attr-meta-content">content</code> attribute on the same
  element giving the value. The name specifies what aspect of metadata
  is being set; valid names and the meaning of their values are
  described in the following sections.  If a <code>meta</code> element
  has no <code title="attr-meta-content">content</code> attribute,
  then the value part of the metadata name/value pair is the empty
  string.</p>

  <p>If a <code>meta</code> element has the <code
  title="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code> attribute specified,
  it must be either in a <code>head</code> element or in a
  <code>noscript</code> element that itself is in a <code>head</code>
  element. If a <code>meta</code> element does not have the <code
  title="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code> attribute specified,
  it must be in a <code>head</code> element.</p>

  <p>The DOM attributes <dfn
  title="dom-meta-name"><code>name</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="dom-meta-content"><code>content</code></dfn> must
  <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the same
  name. The DOM attribute <dfn
  title="dom-meta-httpEquiv"><code>httpEquiv</code></dfn> must
  <span>reflect</span> the content attribute <code
  title="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code>.</p>


  <h5>Standard metadata names</h5>

  <p>This specification defines a few names for the <code
  title="attr-meta-name">name</code> attribute of the
  <code>meta</code> element.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="meta-application-name">application-name</dfn></dt>

   <dd><p>The value must be a short free-form string that giving the
   name of the Web application that the page represents. If the page
   is not a Web application, the <code
   title="meta-application-name">application-name</code> metadata name
   must not be used. User agents may use the application name in UI in
   preference to the page's <code>title</code>, since the title might
   include status messages and the like relevant to the status of the
   page at a particular moment in time instead of just being the name
   of the application.</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn title="meta-description">description</dfn></dt>

   <dd><p>The value must be a free-form string that describes the
   page. The value must be appropriate for use in a directory of
   pages, e.g. in a search engine.</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn title="meta-generator">generator</dfn></dt>

   <dd><p>The value must be a free-form string that identifies the
   software used to generate the document. This value must not be used
   on hand-authored pages.</p></dd>

  </dl>


  <h5>Other metadata names</h5>

  <p><dfn title="concept-meta-extensions">Extensions to the predefined
  set of metadata names</dfn> may be registered in the <a
  href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions">WHATWG Wiki
  MetaExtensions page</a>.

  <p>Anyone is free to edit the WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page at any
  time to add a type. These new names must be specified with the
  following information:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Keyword</dt>

   <dd><p>The actual name being defined. The name should not be
   confusingly similar to any other defined name (e.g. differing only
   in case).</p></dd>


   <dt>Brief description</dt>

   <dd><p>A short description of what the metadata name's meaning is,
   including the format the value is required to be in.</p></dd>


   <dt>Link to more details</dt>

   <dd>A link to a more detailed description of the metadata name's
   semantics and requirements. It could be another page on the Wiki,
   or a link to an external page.</dd>


   <dt>Synonyms</dt>

   <dd><p>A list of other names that have exactly the same processing
   requirements. Authors should not use the names defined to be
   synonyms, they are only intended to allow user agents to support
   legacy content.</p></dd>


   <dt>Status</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>One of the following:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt>Proposal</dt>

     <dd>The name has not received wide peer review and
     approval. Someone has proposed it and is using it.</dd>

     <dt>Accepted</dt>

     <dd>The name has received wide peer review and approval. It has a
     specification that unambiguously defines how to handle pages that
     use the name, including when they use it in incorrect ways.</dd>

     <dt>Unendorsed</dt>

     <dd>The metadata name has received wide peer review and it has
     been found wanting. Existing pages are using this keyword, but
     new pages should avoid it. The "brief description" and "link to
     more details" entries will give details of what authors should
     use instead, if anything.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>If a metadata name is added with the "proposal" status and
    found to be redundant with existing values, it should be removed
    and listed as a synonym for the existing value.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Conformance checkers must use the information given on the WHATWG
  Wiki MetaExtensions page to establish if a value not explicitly
  defined in this specification is allowed or not. When an author uses
  a new type not defined by either this specification or the Wiki
  page, conformance checkers should offer to add the value to the
  Wiki, with the details described above, with the "proposal"
  status.</p>

  <p>This specification does not define how new values will get
  approved. It is expected that the Wiki will have a community that
  addresses this.</p>

  <p>Metadata names whose values are to be <span
  title="URL">URLs</span> must not be proposed or accepted. Links must
  be represented using the <code>link</code> element, not the
  <code>meta</code> element.</p>


  <h5>Pragma directives</h5>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="attr-meta-http-equiv"><code>http-equiv</code></dfn> attribute
  is specified on a <code>meta</code> element, the element is a pragma
  directive.</p>

  <p>The <code
  title="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code> attribute
  is an <span>enumerated attribute</span>. The following table lists
  the keywords defined for this attribute. The states given in the
  first cell of the rows with keywords give the states to which
  those keywords map. Some of the keywords are non-conforming, as
  noted in the last column.</p>

  <p>When a <code>meta</code> element is <span title="insert an
  element into a document">inserted into the document</span>, if its
  <code title="attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</code> attribute is
  present and represents one of the above states, then the user agent

   <dd>

     <li><p>If another <code>meta</code> element in the <span
     title="attr-meta-http-equiv-content-language">Content Language
     state</span> has already been successfully processed (i.e. when

  PragmaExtensions page</a>.</p>

  <p>Such extensions must use a name that is identical to a
  previously-registered HTTP header defined in an RFC, and must have
  behavior identical to that described for the HTTP header. Pragma
  directions corresponding to headers describing metadata, or not
  requiring specific user agent processing, must not be registered;
  instead, use <span title="concept-meta-extensions">metadata
  names</span>. Pragma directions corresponding to headers that affect
  the HTTP processing model (e.g. caching) must not be registered, as
  they would result in HTTP-level behavior being different for user
  agents that implement HTML than for user agents that do not.</p>

  <p>Anyone is free to edit the WHATWG Wiki PragmaExtensions page at
  any time to add a pragma directive satisfying these conditions. Such
  registrations must specify the following information:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Keyword</dt>

   <dd><p>The actual name being defined.</p></dd>


   <dt>Brief description</dt>

   <dd><p>A short description of the purpose of the pragma

  <p>The <code>style</code> element allows authors to embed style
  information in their documents. The <code>style</code> element is
  one of several inputs to the <span>styling processing
  model</span>. The element does not <span
  title="represents">represent</span> content for the user.</p>

  <p>If the <dfn title="attr-style-type"><code>type</code></dfn>
  attribute is given, it must contain a valid MIME type, optionally
  with parameters, that designates a styling language. <a
  href="#refsRFC2046">[RFC2046]</a> If the attribute is absent, the
  type defaults to <code>text/css</code>. <a
  href="#refsRFC2318">[RFC2138]</a></p>

  <!-- XXX this is the second time we have this paragraph here... -->
  <p>When examining types to determine if they support the language,
  user agents must not ignore unknown MIME parameters &mdash; types
  with unknown parameters must be assumed to be unsupported.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-style-media"><code>media</code></dfn>
  attribute says which media the styles apply to. The value must be a
  valid <a href="#mq">media query</a>. <a href="#refsMQ">[MQ]</a> User
  agents must apply the styles to <span title="view">views</span>
  while their state match the listed media, and must not apply them
  otherwise.</p><!-- note similar text in <link> section -->

  <p class="note">The styles might be further limited in scope,
  e.g. in CSS with the use of <code title="">@media</code>
  blocks. This specification does not override such further
  restrictions or requirements.</p><!-- note similar text in <link>
  section -->

  <p id="style-default-media">The default, if the <code
  title="attr-style-media">media</code> attribute is omitted, is
  <code>all</code>, meaning that by default styles apply to all
  media.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-style-scoped"><code>scoped</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>. If the attribute is
  present, then the user agent must apply the specified style
  information only to the <code>style</code> element's parent element
  (if any), and that element's child nodes. Otherwise, the specified
  styles must, if applied, be applied to the entire document.</p>

  <p id="title-on-style">The <dfn

  <code>style</code> elements defines <span>alternative style sheet

  title="attr-style-title">title</code> attribute, then it has no
  title; the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute of
  ancestors does not apply to the <code>style</code> element.</p> <!--
  XXX xref -->

  <p class="note">The <code title="attr-style-title">title</code>
  attribute on <code>style</code> elements, like the <code
  title="attr-link-title">title</code> attribute on <code>link</code>
  elements, differs from the global <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute in that a
  <code>style</code> block without a title does not inherit the title
  of the parent element: it merely has no title.</p>

  <p>All descendant elements must be processed, according to their
  semantics, before the <code>style</code> element itself is
  evaluated. For styling languages that consist of pure text, user
  agents must evaluate <code>style</code> elements by passing the
  concatenation of the contents of all the <span title="text
  node">text nodes</span> that are direct children of the
  <code>style</code> element (not any other nodes such as comments or
  elements), in <span>tree order</span>, to the style system. For
  XML-based styling languages, user agents must pass all the child
  nodes of the <code>style</code> element to the style system.</p>

  <p>All <span title="URL">URLs</span> found by the styling language's
  processor must be <span title="resolve a url">resolved</span>,
  relative to the element (or as defined by the styling language),
  when the processor is invoked.<!-- so dynamic changes to the base
  URL don't affect the CSS --></p>

  <p>For <code>style</code> elements, if the user agent does not
  support the specified styling language, then the <code

  the styling processing model</span> (i.e. that do not have a <code
  title="rel-stylesheet">stylesheet</code> keyword in their <code

  elements whose specified resource has not yet been fetched, or is
  not in a supported styling language, must have their

  <h3>Scripting</h3>

  <p>Scripts allow authors to add interactivity to their documents.</p>

  <p>Authors are encouraged to use declarative alternatives to
  scripting where possible, as declarative mechanisms are often more
  maintainable, and many users disable scripting.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, instead of using script to show or hide a section
   to show more details, the <code>details</code> element could be
   used.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Authors are also encouraged to make their applications degrade
  gracefully in the absence of scripting support.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, if an author provides a link in a table header to
   dynamically resort the table, the link could also be made to
   function without scripts by requesting the sorted table from the
   server.</p>

  <p>The <code>script</code> element allows authors to include dynamic
  script and data blocks in their documents.  The element does not
  <span title="represents">represent</span> content for the user.</p>

  <p>When used to include dynamic scripts, the scripts may either be
  embedded inline or may be imported from an external file using the
  <code title="attr-script-src">src</code> attribute. If the language
  is not that described by "<code title="">text/javascript</code>",
  then the <code title="attr-script-type">type</code> attribute must
  be present. If the <code title="attr-script-type">type</code>
  attribute is present, its value must be the type of the script's
  language.</p>

  <p>When used to include data blocks, the data must be embedded
  inline, the format of the data must be given using the <code
  title="attr-script-type">type</code> attribute, and the <code
  title="attr-script-src">src</code> attribute must not be
  specified.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-script-type"><code>type</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the language of the script or format of the data. If
  the attribute is present, its value must be a valid MIME type,
  optionally with parameters. The <code title="">charset</code>
  parameter must not be specified. (The default, which is used if the
  attribute is absent, is "<code title="">text/javascript</code>".) <a
  href="#refsRFC2046">[RFC2046]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-script-src"><code>src</code></dfn>
  attribute, if specified, gives the address of the external script
  resource to use. The value of the attribute must be a <span>valid
  URL</span> identifying a script resource of the type given by the
  <code title="attr-script-type">type</code> attribute, if the
  attribute is present, or of the type "<code
  title="">text/javascript</code>", if the attribute is absent.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-script-charset"><code>charset</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the character encoding of the external script
  resource. The attribute must not be specified if the <code
  title="attr-script-src">src</code> attribute is not present. If the
  attribute is set, its value must be a valid character encoding name,
  must be the preferred name for that encoding, and must match the
  encoding given in the <code title="">charset</code> parameter of the
  <span title="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span> of the
  external file, if any. <a
  href="#refsIANACHARSET">[IANACHARSET]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-script-async"><code>async</code></dfn> and
  <dfn title="attr-script-defer"><code>defer</code></dfn> attributes
  are <span title="boolean attribute">boolean attributes</span> that
  indicate how the script should be executed.</p>

  <p>There are three possible modes that can be selected using these
  attributes. If the <code title="attr-script-async">async</code>
  attribute is present, then the script will be executed
  asynchronously, as soon as it is available. If the <code
  title="attr-script-async">async</code> attribute is not present but
  the <code title="attr-script-defer">defer</code> attribute is
  present, then the script is executed when the page has finished
  parsing. If neither attribute is present, then the script is
  fetched and executed immediately, before the user agent continues
  parsing the page. The exact processing details for these attributes
  is described below.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-script-defer">defer</code> attribute may be
  specified even if the <code title="attr-script-async">async</code>
  attribute is specified, to cause legacy Web browsers that only
  support <code title="attr-script-defer">defer</code> (and not <code
  title="attr-script-async">async</code>) to fall back to the <code
  title="attr-script-defer">defer</code> behavior instead of the
  synchronous blocking behavior that is the default.</p>

  <p>Changing the <code title="attr-script-src">src</code>, <code
  title="attr-script-type">type</code>, <code
  title="attr-script-charset">charset</code>, <code
  title="attr-script-async">async</code>, and <code
  title="attr-script-defer">defer</code> attributes dynamically has no
  direct effect; these attribute are only used at specific times
  described below (namely, when the element is <span title="insert an
  element into a document">inserted into the document</span>).</p>
  <!-- by implication, changes to the base URL also have no effect -->

  <p><code>script</code> elements have four associated pieces of
  metadata. The first is a flag indicating whether or not the script
  block has been <dfn>"already executed"</dfn>. Initially,
  <code>script</code> elements must have this flag unset (script
  blocks, when created, are not "already executed"). When a
  <code>script</code> element is cloned, the "already executed" flag,
  if set, must be propagated to the clone when it is created. The
  second is a flag indicating whether the element was
  <dfn>"parser-inserted"</dfn>. This flag is set by the <span>HTML
  parser</span> and is used to handle <code
  title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> calls. The third
  and fourth pieces of metadata are <dfn><var>the script block's
  type</var></dfn> and <dfn><var>the script block's character
  encoding</var></dfn>. They are determined when the script is run,
  based on the attributes on the element at that time.</p>

  <p>When a <code>script</code> element that is neither marked as
  having <span>"already executed"</span> nor marked as being
  <span>"parser-inserted"</span> experiences one of the events listed
  in the following list, the user agent must <span title="running a

  <ul>

   <li>The <code>script</code> element gets <span title="insert an

   <li>The <code>script</code> element's child nodes are changed.</li>

   <li>The <code>script</code> element has a <code

   the elment had no such attribute.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><dfn title="running a script">Running a script</dfn>: When a

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If either:</p>

     <li>the <code>script</code> element has a <code

     <li>the <code>script</code> element has no <code
     title="attr-script-type">type</code> attribute but it has a <code

     <li>the <code>script</code> element has neither a <code

    </ul>

    <p>...let <var>the script block's type</var> for this
    <code>script</code> element be "<code

    <p>Otherwise, if the <code>script</code> element has a <code
    title="attr-script-type">type</code> attribute, let <var>the
    script block's type</var> for this <code>script</code> element be
    the value of that attribute.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the element has a non-empty <code
    title="attr-script-language">language</code> attribute; let
    <var>the script block's type</var> for this <code>script</code>
    element be the concatenation of the string "<code
    title="">text/</code>" followed by the value of the <code
    title="attr-script-language">language</code> attribute.</p> <!--
    user agents already support, e.g., type="text/javascript1.3", so
    we don't have to support that separately. -->

    <p class="note">The <code
    title="attr-script-language">language</code> attribute is never
    conforming, and is always ignored if there is a <code
    title="attr-script-type">type</code> attribute present.</p>

   <li>

    <p>If the <code>script</code> element has a <code
    title="attr-script-charset">charset</code> attribute, then let
    <var>the script block's character encoding</var> for this
    <code>script</code> element be the encoding given by the <code

    <p>Otherwise, let <var>the script block's character encoding</var>
    for this <code>script</code> element be the same as <span

    itself</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <span title="concept-n-noscript">scripting is
    disabled</span> for the <code>script</code> element, or if the
    user agent does not <span>support the scripting language</span>
    given by <var>the script block's type</var> for this
    <code>script</code> element, then the user agent must abort these
    steps at this point. The script is not executed.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the element has no <code title="attr-script-src">src</code>
    attribute, and its child nodes consist only of comment nodes and
    empty <span title="text node">text nodes</span>, then the user
    agent must abort these steps at this point. The script is not
    executed.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must set the element's <span>"already
    executed"</span> flag.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the element has a <code title="attr-script-src">src</code>
    attribute, then the value of that attribute must be <span
    title="resolve a url">resolved</span> relative to the element, and
    if that is successful, the specified resource must then be <span
    title="fetch">fetched</span>.</p>

    <p>For historical reasons, if the <span>URL</span> is a <span
    title="javascript protocol"><code title="">javascript:</code>
    URL</span>, then the user agent must not, despite the requirements
    in the definition of the <span title="fetch">fetching</span>
    algorithm, actually execute the given script; instead the user
    agent must act as if it had received an empty HTTP 400
    response.</p>

    <p>Once the resource's <span title="Content-Type">Content Type
    metadata</span> is available, if it ever is, apply the
    <span>algorithm for extracting an encoding from a
    Content-Type</span> to it. If this returns an encoding, and the
    user agent supports that encoding, then let <var>the script
    block's character encoding</var> be that encoding.</p>

    <p>Once the fetching process has completed, and the script has
    <dfn>completed loading</dfn>, the user agent will have to complete
    <span title="when a script completes loading">the steps described
    below</span>. (If the parser is still active at that time, those
    steps defer to the parser to handle the execution of pending
    scripts.)</p>

    <p>For performance reasons, user agents may start fetching the
    script as soon as the attribute is set, instead, in the hope that
    the element will be inserted into the document. Either way, once
    the element is <span title="insert an element into a
    document">inserted into the document</span>, the load must have
    started. If the UA performs such prefetching, but the element is
    never inserted in the document, or the <code
    title="attr-script-src">src</code> attribute is dynamically
    changed,<!-- or the base URL is dynamically changed,--> then the
    user agent will not execute the script, and the fetching process
    will have been effectively wasted.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Then, the first of the following options that describes the
    situation must be followed:</p>

  <p>The <code>body</code> element <span>represents</span> the main
  content of the document.</p>

  <p>In conforming documents, there is only one <code>body</code>
  element. The <code title="dom-document-body">document.body</code>
  DOM attribute provides scripts with easy access to a document's
  <code>body</code> element.</p>

  <p class="note">Some DOM operations (for example, parts of the
  <span>drag and drop</span> model) are defined in terms of "<span>the
  body element</span>". This refers to a particular element in the
  DOM, as per the definition of the term, and not any arbitrary
  <code>body</code> element.</p>

  <p>The <code>body</code> element exposes as <span>event handler
  content attributes</span> a number of the <span>event handler
  attributes</span> of the <code>Window</code> object. It also mirrors
  their <span>event handler DOM attributes</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="handler-window-onerror">onerror</code> and <code
  title="handler-window-onmessage">onmessage</code> <span>event
  handler attributes</span> of the <code>Window</code> object, exposed
  on the <code>body</code> element, shadow the generic <code
  title="handler-onerror">onerror</code> and <code
  title="handler-onmessage">onmessage</code> <span>event handler
  attributes</span> normally supported by <span>HTML
  elements</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">Thus, for example, a bubbling <code
  title="event-message">message</code> event fired on a child of
  <span>the body element</span> of a <code>Document</code> would first
  trigger the <code title="handler-onmessage">onmessage</code>
  <span>event handler content attributes</span> of that element, then
  that of the root <code>html</code> element, and only <em>then</em>
  would it trigger the <code
  title="handler-window-onmessage">onmessage</code> <span title="event
  handler content attributes">event handler content attribute</span>
  on the <code>body</code> element. This is because the event would
  bubble from the target, to the <code>body</code>, to the
  <code>html</code>, to the <code>Document</code>, to the
  <code>Window</code>, and the event handler attribute on the
  <code>body</code> is watching the <code>Window</code> not the
  <code>body</code>. A regular event listener attached to the
  <code>body</code> using <code title="">addEventListener()</code>,
  however, would fire when the event bubbled through the
  <code>body</code> and not when it reaches the <code>Window</code>
  object.</p>


  <h4>The <dfn><code>section</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <p>The <code>section</code> element <span>represents</span> a
  generic document or application section. A section, in this context,
  is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a header, possibly
  with a footer.</p>

  <p class="example">Examples of sections would be chapters, the
  various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered
  sections of a thesis. A Web site's home page could be split into
  sections for an introduction, news items, contact information.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, we see an article (part of a larger
   Web page) about apples, containing two short sections.</p>

   <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;header>
  &lt;h1>Apples&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>Tasty, delicious fruit!&lt;/p>
 &lt;/header>
 &lt;p>The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree.&lt;/p>
 &lt;section>
  &lt;h1>Red Delicious&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>These bright red apples are the most common found in many
  supermarkets.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/section>
 &lt;section>

  <p>The <code>nav</code> element <span>represents</span> a section of
  a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a
  section with navigation links. Not all groups of links on a page
  need to be in a <code>nav</code> element &mdash; only sections that
  consist of primary navigation blocks are appropriate for the
  <code>nav</code> element. In particular, it is common for footers to
  have a list of links to various key parts of a site, but the
  <code>footer</code> element is more appropriate in such cases.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the page has several places where
   links are present, but only one of those places is considered a
   navigation section.</p>

   <pre>&lt;body>

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>article</code> element <span>represents</span> a
  section of a page that consists of a composition that forms an
  independent part of a document, page, or site. This could be a forum
  post, a magazine or newspaper article, a Web log entry, a
  user-submitted comment, or any other independent item of
  content.</p>

  <p class="note">An <code>article</code> element is "independent" in
  that its contents could stand alone, for example in syndication.
  However, the element is still associated with its ancestors; for
  instance, contact information that <a
  href="#applyToSection">applies</a> to a parent <code>body</code>
  element still covers the <code>article</code> as well.</p> <!-- XXX
  or should we apply the rules in the last paragraph to all articles?
  -->

  <p>When <code>article</code> elements are nested, the inner
  <code>article</code> elements represent articles that are in
  principle related to the contents of the outer article. For
  instance, a Web log entry on a site that accepts user-submitted
  comments could represent the comments as <code>article</code>
  elements nested within the <code>article</code> element for the Web
  log entry.</p>

  <p>Author information associated with an <code>article</code>
  element (q.v. the <code>address</code> element) does not apply to
  nested <code>article</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <code>aside</code> element <span>represents</span> a section
  of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to
  the content around the <code>aside</code> element, and which could
  be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often
  represented as sidebars in printed typography.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example shows how an aside is used to mark up
   background material on Switzerland in a much longer news story on Europe.</p>

   <pre>&lt;aside>
 &lt;h1>Switzerland&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>Switzerland, a land-locked country in the middle of geographic
 Europe, has not joined the geopolitical European Union, though it is
 a signatory to a number of European treaties.&lt;/p>
&lt;/aside></pre>

  <p>These elements define headers for their sections.</p>

  <p>The semantics and meaning of these elements are defined in the
  section on <span>headings and sections</span>.</p>

  <p>These elements have a <dfn>rank</dfn> given by the number in
  their name. The <code>h1</code> element is said to have the highest
  rank, the <code>h6</code> element has the lowest rank, and two
  elements with the same name have equal rank.</p>

  <p>The <code>header</code> element <span>represents</span> the
  header of a section. The element is typically used to group a set of
  <code>h1</code>&ndash;<code>h6</code> elements to mark up a page's
  title with its subtitle or tagline. However, <code>header</code>
  elements may contain more than just the section's headings and
  subheadings &mdash; for example it would be reasonable for the
  header to include version history information.

  <p>For the purposes of document summaries, outlines, and the like,
  the text of <code>header</code> elements is defined to be the text
  of the highest <span title="rank">ranked</span>
  <code>h1</code>&ndash;<code>h6</code> element descendant of the
  <code>header</code> element, if there are any such elements, and the
  first such element if there are multiple elements with that
  <span>rank</span>. If there are no such elements, then the text of
  the <code>header</code> element is the empty string.</p>

  <p>Other heading elements in the <code>header</code> element
  indicate subheadings or subtitles.</p>

  <p>The <span>rank</span> of a <code>header</code> element is the
  same as for an <code>h1</code> element (the highest rank).</p>

  <p>The section on <span>headings and sections</span>
  defines how <code>header</code> elements are assigned to individual
  sections.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here are some examples of valid headers. In each case, the
   emphasised text represents the text that would be used as the
   header in an application extracting header data and ignoring
   subheadings.</p>

  <p>The <code>footer</code> element <span>represents</span> a footer
  for the section it <a href="#applyToSection">applies</a> to. A
  footer typically contains information about its section such as who
  wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the
  like.</p>

  <p>Contact information for the section given in a
  <code>footer</code> should be marked up using the
  <code>address</code> element.</p>

  <p>Footers don't necessarily have to appear at the end of a section,
  though they usually do.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here is a page with two footers, one at the top and one at the
   bottom, with the same content:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body>
 &lt;footer>&lt;a href="../">Back to index...&lt;/a>&lt;/footer>

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>address</code> element <span>represents</span> the
  contact information for the section it <a
  href="#applyToSection">applies</a> to. If it applies to <span>the
  body element</span>, then it instead applies to the document as a
  whole.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, a page at the W3C Web site related to HTML might
   include the following contact information:</p>
   <pre>&lt;ADDRESS>
 &lt;A href="../People/Raggett/">Dave Raggett&lt;/A>, 
 &lt;A href="../People/Arnaud/">Arnaud Le Hors&lt;/A>, 
 contact persons for the &lt;A href="Activity">W3C HTML Activity&lt;/A>
&lt;/ADDRESS></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <code>address</code> element must not be used to represent
  arbitrary addresses (e.g. postal addresses), unless those addresses
  are contact information for the section. (The <code>p</code> element
  is the appropriate element for marking up such addresses.)</p>

  <p>The <code>address</code> element must not contain information
  other than contact information.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, the following is non-conforming use of the
   <code>address</code> element:</p>
   <pre>&lt;ADDRESS>Last Modified: 1999/12/24 23:37:50&lt;/ADDRESS></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Typically, the <code>address</code> element would be included
  with other information in a <code>footer</code> element.</p>

  <p>To determine the contact information for a <span>sectioning
  content</span> element (such as a document's <code>body</code>
  element, which would give the contact information for the page), UAs
  must collect all the <code>address</code> elements that <a
  href="#applyToSection">apply</a> to that <span>sectioning
  content</span> element and its ancestor <span>sectioning
  content</span> elements. The contact information is the collection
  of all the information given by those elements.</p> <!-- XXX
  exception for nested article elements? -->

  <p class="note">Contact information for one <span>sectioning
  content</span> element, e.g.  an <code>aside</code> element, does
  not apply to its ancestor elements, e.g. the page's
  <code>body</code>.</p>



  <h4><dfn>Headings and sections</dfn></h4>

  <p>The <code>h1</code>&ndash;<code>h6</code> elements and the
  <code>header</code> element are headings.</p>

  <p>The first element of <span>heading content</span> in an element
  of <span>sectioning content</span> <span>represents</span> the
  header for that section. Subsequent headers of equal or higher
  <span>rank</span> start new (implied) sections, headers of lower
  <span>rank</span> start implied subsections that are part of the
  previous one. In both cases, the element <span>represents</span> the
  header of the implied section.</p>

  <p><span>Sectioning content</span> elements are always considered
  subsections of their nearest ancestor element of <span>sectioning
  content</span>, regardless of what implied sections other headings
  may have created.</p>

  <p>Certain elements are said to be <dfn title="sectioning
  root">sectioning roots</dfn>, including <code>blockquote</code> and
  <code>td</code> elements. These elements can have their own
  outlines, but the sections and headers inside these elements do not
  contribute to the outlines of their ancestors.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For the following fragment:</p>
   <pre>&lt;body&gt;

    <li>
     Foo (heading of explicit <code>body</code> section, containing the "Grunt" paragraph)
     <ol>
      <li>
       Bar (heading starting implied section, containing a block quote and the "Baz" paragraph)
      </li>
      <li>
       Quux (heading starting implied section)
      </li>
      <li>
       Thud (heading of explicit <code>section</code> section)
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>Notice how the <code>section</code> ends the earlier implicit
   section so that a later paragraph ("Grunt") is back at the top
   level.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Sections may contain headers of any <span>rank</span>, but
  authors are strongly encouraged to either use only <code>h1</code>
  elements, or to use elements of the appropriate <span>rank</span>
  for the section's nesting level.</p>

  <p>Authors are also encouraged to explicitly wrap sections in
  elements of <span>sectioning content</span>, instead of relying on
  the implicit sections generated by having multiple heading in one
  element of <span>sectioning content</span>.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, the following is correct:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Apples&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Apples are fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Taste&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They taste lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h6&gt;Sweet&lt;/h6&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Red apples are sweeter than green ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Color&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apples come in various colors.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>

   <p>However, the same document would be more clearly expressed
   as:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;Apples&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Apples are fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Taste&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They taste lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;section&gt;
   &lt;h3&gt;Sweet&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Red apples are sweeter than green ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Color&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apples come in various colors.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>

   <p>Both of the documents above are semantically identical and would
   produce the same outline in compliant user agents.</p>

  <h5 id="outlines">Creating an outline</h5>

  <p>This section defines an algorithm for creating an outline for a
  <span>sectioning content</span> element or a <span>sectioning
  root</span> element. It is defined in terms of a walk over the nodes
  of a DOM tree, in tree order, with each node being visited when it
  is <i>entered</i> and when it is <i>exited</i> during the walk.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>outline</dfn> for a <span>sectioning content</span>
  element or a <span>sectioning root</span> element consists of a list
  of one or more potentially nested <span
  title="concept-section">sections</span>. A <dfn
  title="concept-section">section</dfn> is a container that
  corresponds to some nodes in the original DOM tree. Each section can
  have one heading associated with it, and can contain any number of
  further nested sections. The algorithm for the outline also
  associates each node in the DOM tree with a particular section and
  potentially a heading. (The sections in the outline aren't
  <code>section</code> elements, though some may correspond to such
  elements &mdash; they are merely conceptual sections.)</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following markup fragment:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body>
 &lt;h1>A&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>B&lt;/p>
 &lt;h2>C&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>D&lt;/p>
 &lt;h2>E&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>F&lt;/p>
&lt;/body></pre>

   <p>...results in the following outline being created for the
   <code>body</code> node (and thus the entire document):</p>

   <ol class="brief">
    <li>
     <p>Section created for <code>body</code> node.</p>
     <p>Associated with heading "A".</p>
     <p>Also associated with paragraph "B".</p>
     <p>Nested sections:</p>
     <ol class="brief">
      <li>
       <p>Section implied for first <code>h2</code> element.</p>
       <p>Associated with heading "C".</p>
       <p>Also associated with paragraph "D".</p>
       <p>No nested sections.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>Section implied for second <code>h2</code> element.</p>
       <p>Associated with heading "E".</p>
       <p>Also associated with paragraph "F".</p>
       <p>No nested sections.</p>
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
   </ol>

  </div>

  <p>The algorithm that must be followed during a walk of a DOM
  subtree rooted at a <span>sectioning content</span> element or a
  <span>sectioning root</span> element to determine that element's
  <span>outline</span> is as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">current outlinee</var> be null. (It holds
   the element whose <span>outline</span> is being created.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">current section</var> be null. (It holds a
   pointer to a <span title="concept-section">section</span>, so that
   elements in the DOM can all be associated with a section.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Create a stack to hold elements, which is used to handle
   nesting. Initialize this stack to empty.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>As you walk over the DOM in <span>tree order</span>, trigger
    the first relevant step below for each element as you enter and
    exit it.</p>

    <dl class="switch">

     that element</dt>

  <h5>Distinguishing site-wide headings from page headings</h5>

  <p>Given the <span>outline</span> of a document, but ignoring any
  sections created for <code>nav</code> and <code>aside</code>
  elements, and any of their descendants, if the only root of the tree
  is <span>the body element</span>'s <span
  title="concept-section">section</span>, and it has only a single
  subsection which is created by an <code>article</code> element, then
  the heading of <span>the body element</span> should be assumed to be
  a site-wide heading, and the heading of the <code>article</code>
  element should be assumed to be the page's heading.</p>

  <p>If a page starts with a heading that is common to the whole site,
  the document must be authored such that, in the document's
  <span>outline</span>, ignoring any sections created for
  <code>nav</code> and <code>aside</code> elements and any of their
  descendants, the tree has only one root <span
  title="concept-section">section</span>, <span>the body
  element</span>'s section, its heading is the site-wide heading,
  <span>the body element</span> has just one subsection, that
  subsection is created by an <code>article</code> element, and that
  <code>article</code>'s heading is the page heading.</p>

  <p>If a page does not contain a site-wide heading, then the page
  must be authored such that, in the document's <span>outline</span>,
  ignoring any sections created for <code>nav</code> and
  <code>aside</code> elements and any of their descendants, either
  <span>the body element</span> has no subsections, or it has more
  than one subsection, or it has a single subsection but that
  subsection is not created by an <code>article</code> element, or
  there is more than one <span title="concept-section">section</span>
  at the root of the outline.</p>

  <p class="note">Conceptually, a site is thus a document with many
  articles &mdash; when those articles are split into many pages, the
  heading of the original single page becomes the heading of the site,
  repeated on every page.</p>

  stripped.</strong></p>

  <p>Some examples of cases where the <code>pre</code> element could
  be used:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Including an e-mail, with paragraphs indicated by blank lines,
   lists indicated by lines prefixed with a bullet, and so on.</li>

   <li>Including fragments of computer code, with structure indicated
   according to the conventions of that language.</li>

   <li>Displaying ASCII art.</li> <!-- XXX need a note about non-visual UAs -->

  </ul>

  <p>To represent a block of computer code, the <code>pre</code>
  element can be used with a <code>code</code> element; to represent a
  block of computer output the <code>pre</code> element can be used
  with a <code>samp</code> element. Similarly, the <code>kbd</code>
  element can be used within a <code>pre</code> element to indicate
  text that the user is to enter.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following snippet, a sample of computer code is
   presented.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>This is the &lt;code>Panel&lt;/code> constructor:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>function Panel(element, canClose, closeHandler) {
  this.element = element;
  this.canClose = canClose;
  this.closeHandler = function () { if (closeHandler) closeHandler() };
}&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></pre>

  <p>The <code>dialog</code> element <span>represents</span> a
  conversation, meeting minutes, a chat transcript, a dialog in a
  screenplay, an instant message log, or some other construct in which
  different players take turns in discourse.</p>

  <p>Each part of the conversation must have an explicit talker (or
  speaker) given by a <code>dt</code> element, and a discourse (or
  quote) given by a <code>dd</code> element.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>This example demonstrates this using an extract from Abbot and
   Costello's famous sketch, <cite>Who's on first</cite>:</p>
<pre>&lt;dialog>
 &lt;dt> Costello
 &lt;dd> Look, you gotta first baseman?
 &lt;dt> Abbott
 &lt;dd> Certainly.
 &lt;dt> Costello
 &lt;dd> Who's playing first?
 &lt;dt> Abbott
 &lt;dd> That's right.
 &lt;dt> Costello

 &lt;dt> Abbott

  </div>

  <p class="note">Text in a <code>dt</code> element in a
  <code>dialog</code> element is implicitly the source of the text
  given in the following <code>dd</code> element, and the contents of
  the <code>dd</code> element are implicitly a quote from that
  speaker. There is thus no need to include <code>cite</code>,
  <code>q</code>, or <code>blockquote</code> elements in this
  markup. Indeed, a <code>q</code> element inside a <code>dd</code>
  element in a conversation would actually imply the people talking
  were themselves quoting another work. See the <code>cite</code>,
  <code>q</code>, and <code>blockquote</code> elements for other ways
  to cite or quote.</p>

  <p>Content inside a <code>blockquote</code> must be quoted from

  <dfn title="attr-blockquote-cite"><code>cite</code></dfn>
  attribute.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-blockquote-cite">cite</code> attribute
  is present, it must be a <span>valid URL</span>. To obtain the
  corresponding citation link, the value of the attribute must be
  <span title="resolve a url">resolved</span> relative to the
  element. User agents should allow users to follow such citation
  links.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-quote-cite"><code>cite</code></dfn> DOM

  <p>The <code>ol</code> element <span>represents</span> a list of

  <p>The items of the list are the <code>li</code> element child nodes

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-ol-reversed"><code>reversed</code></dfn>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-ol-start"><code>start</code></dfn>

  <p>The first item in the list has the ordinal value given by the

  be successfully parsed, in which case it has the ordinal value given
  by that <code title="attr-li-value">value</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>Each subsequent item in the list has the ordinal value given by
  its <code title="attr-li-value">value</code> attribute, if it has
  one, or, if it doesn't, the ordinal value of the previous item, plus
  one if the <code title="attr-ol-reversed">reversed</code> is absent,

  <p>The <code>li</code> element <span>represents</span> a list
  item. If its parent element is an <code>ol</code>, <code>ul</code>,
  or <code>menu</code> element, then the element is an item of the
  parent element's list, as defined for those elements. Otherwise, the
  list item has no defined list-related relationship to any other
  <code>li</code> element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-li-value"><code>value</code></dfn>
  attribute, if present, must be a <span>valid integer</span> giving
  the ordinal value of the list item.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-li-value">value</code> attribute is

  <p>The <code title="attr-li-value">value</code> attribute is

   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>Uses <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>dl</code> element <span>represents</span> an
  association list consisting of zero or more name-value groups (a
  description list). Each group must consist of one or more names
  (<code>dt</code> elements) followed by one or more values
  (<code>dd</code> elements).</p>

  <p>Name-value groups may be terms and definitions, metadata topics
  and values, or any other groups of name-value data.</p>

  <p>The values within a group are alternatives; multiple paragraphs
  forming part of the same value must all be given within the same
  <code>dd</code> element.</p>

  <p>The order of the list of groups, and of the names and values
  within each group, may be significant.</p>

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element is empty, it contains no groups.</p>

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element contains non-<span
  title="inter-element whitespace">whitespace</span> <span title="text
  node">text nodes</span>, or elements other than <code>dt</code> and
  <code>dd</code>, then those elements or <span title="text node">text
  nodes</span> do not form part of any groups in that
  <code>dl</code>.</p>

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element contains only <code>dt</code>
  elements, then it consists of one group with names but no
  values.</p>

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element contains only <code>dd</code>
  elements, then it consists of one group with values but no
  names.</p>

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element starts with one or more
  <code>dd</code> elements, then the first group has no associated
  name.</p>

  <p>If a <code>dl</code> element ends with one or more
  <code>dt</code> elements, then the last group has no associated
  value.</p>

  <p class="note">When a <code>dl</code> element doesn't match its
  content model, it is often due to accidentally using <code>dd</code>
  elements in the place of <code>dt</code> elements and vice
  versa. Conformance checkers can spot such mistakes and might be able
  to advise authors how to correctly use the markup.</p>

  <h4>Common grouping idioms</h4>

  <h5>Tag clouds</h5>

  <p id="tag-cloud">This specification does not define any markup
  specifically for marking up lists of keywords that apply to a group
  of pages (also known as <i>tag clouds</i>). In general, authors are
  encouraged to either mark up such lists using <code>ul</code>
  elements with explicit inline counts that are then hidden and turned
  into a presentational effect using a style sheet, or to use SVG.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here, three tags are included in a short tag cloud:</p>

   <pre>&lt;style>
@media screen, print, handheld, tv {
  /* should be ignored by non-visual browsers */
  .tag-cloud > li > span { display: none; }
  .tag-cloud > li { display: inline; }
  .tag-cloud-1 { font-size: 0.7em; }
  .tag-cloud-2 { font-size: 0.9em; }
  .tag-cloud-3 { font-size: 1.1em; }
  .tag-cloud-4 { font-size: 1.3em; }
  .tag-cloud-5 { font-size: 1.5em; }
}
&lt;/style>
...
&lt;ul class="tag-cloud">
 &lt;li class="tag-cloud-4">&lt;a title="28 instances" href="/t/apple">apple&lt;/a> &lt;span>(popular)&lt;/span>
 &lt;li class="tag-cloud-2">&lt;a title="6 instances"  href="/t/kiwi">kiwi&lt;/a> &lt;span>(rare)&lt;/span>
 &lt;li class="tag-cloud-5">&lt;a title="41 instances" href="/t/pear">pear&lt;/a> &lt;span>(very popular)&lt;/span>
&lt;/ul></pre>

   <p>The actual frequency of each tag is given using the <code
   title="attr-title">title</code> attribute. A CSS style sheet is
   provided to convert the markup into a cloud of differently-sized
   words, but for user agents that do not support CSS or are not
   visual, the markup contains annotations like "(popular)" or
   "(rare)" to categorise the various tags by frequency, thus enabling
   all users to benefit from the information.</p>

   <p>The <code>ul</code> element is used (rather than
   <code>ol</code>) because the order is not particular important:
   while the list is in fact ordered alphabetically, it would convey
   the same information if ordered by, say, the length of the tag.</p>

   <p>The <code title="rel-tag">tag</code> <code
   title="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code>-keyword is <em>not</em> used
   on these <code>a</code> elements because they do not represent tags
   that apply to the page itself; they are just part of an index
   listing the tags themselves.</p>

  <p>Interactive user agents should allow users to <span

  title="attr-hyperlink-hreflang">hreflang</code>, and <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code> attributes may be used to
  indicate to the user the likely nature of the target resource before

  <p>The <span>activation behavior</span> of <code>a</code> elements

  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <code title="event-DOMActivate">DOMActivate</code>

   class="XXX">...</span> then raise an
   <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the target of the <code title="event-click">click</code>
   event is an <code>img</code> element with an <code
   title="attr-img-ismap">ismap</code> attribute specified, then
   server-side image map processing must be performed, as follows:</p>

    <ol>

     <!-- http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C%21DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A...%3Ca%20href%3D%22%23%22%3E%3Cimg%20ismap%20usemap%3D%22%23a%22%20src%3D/resources/images/smallcats%3E%3C/a%3E%0A%3Cmap%20name%3Da%3E%3Carea%20shape%3Drect%20coords%3D0%2C0%2C50%2C50%20href%3Db%3E%3C/map%3E -->

     <li>If the <code title="event-DOMActivate">DOMActivate</code>
     event was dispatched as the result of a real
     pointing-device-triggered <code title="event-click">click</code>
     event on the <code>img</code> element, then let <var
     title="">x</var> be the distance in CSS pixels from the left edge
     of the image's left border, if it has one, or the left edge of
     the image otherwise, to the location of the click, and let <var
     title="">y</var> be the distance in CSS pixels from the top edge
     of the image's top border, if it has one, or the top edge of the
     image otherwise, to the location of the click. Otherwise, let
     <var title="">x</var> and <var title="">y</var> be zero.</li>

     <li>Let the <dfn><var>hyperlink suffix</var></dfn> be a U+003F

     expressed as a base-ten integer using ASCII digits (U+0030 DIGIT
     ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE), a U+002C COMMA character, and the
     value of <var title="">y</var> expressed as a base-ten integer
     using ASCII digits.</li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Finally, the user agent must <span title="following

   <dd>
    The <code>q</code> element uses the <code>HTMLQuoteElement</code> interface.
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>q</code> element <span>represents</span> some <span
  title="phrasing content">phrasing content</span> quoted from another
  source.</p>

  <p>Quotation punctuation (such as quotation marks) must not appear
  immediately before, after, or inside <code>q</code> elements; they
  will be inserted into the rendering by the user agent.</p>

  <p>Content inside a <code>q</code> element must be quoted from
  another source, whose address, if it has one, should be cited in the
  <dfn title="attr-q-cite"><code>cite</code></dfn> attribute. The
  source may be fictional, as when quoting characters in a novel or
  screenplay.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-q-cite">cite</code> attribute is
  present, it must be a <span>valid URL</span>. To obtain the
  corresponding citation link, the value of the attribute must be
  <span title="resolve a url">resolved</span> relative to the
  element. User agents should allow users to follow such citation
  links.</p>

  <p>The <code>q</code> element must not be used in place of quotation
  marks that do not represent quotes; for example, it is inappropriate
  to use the <code>q</code> element for marking up sarcastic
  statements.</p>

  <p>The use of <code>q</code> elements to mark up quotations is
  entirely optional; using explicit quotation punctuation without
  <code>q</code> elements is just as correct.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here is a simple example of the use of the <code>q</code>
   element:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The man said &lt;q>Things that are impossible just take
longer&lt;/q>. I disagreed with him.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here is an example with both an explicit citation link in the
   <code>q</code> element, and an explicit citation outside:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The W3C page &lt;cite>About W3C&lt;/cite> says the W3C's
mission is &lt;q cite="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">To lead the
World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and
guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web&lt;/q>. I
disagree with this mission.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the quotation itself contains a
   quotation:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>In &lt;cite>Example One&lt;/cite>, he writes &lt;q>The man
said &lt;q>Things that are impossible just take longer&lt;/q>. I
disagreed with him&lt;/q>. Well, I disagree even more!&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, quotation marks are used instead of
   the <code>q</code> element:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>His best argument was &#x275D;I disagree&#x275E;, which
I thought was laughable.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, there is no quote &mdash; the
   quotation marks are used to name a word. Use of the <code>q</code>
   element in this case would be inappropriate.</p>

   <!-- XXX should the cite element have a cite attribute? -->
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>cite</code> element <span>represents</span> the title
  of a work (e.g.
  a book,
  a paper,
  an essay,
  a poem,
  a score,
  a song,
  a script,
  a film,
  a TV show,
  a game,
  a sculpture,
  a painting,
  a theatre production,
  a play,
  an opera,
  a musical,
  an exhibition,
  etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or
  referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work
  that is mentioned in passing.</p>

  <p>A person's name is not the title of a work &mdash; even if people
  call that person a piece of work &mdash; and the element must
  therefore not be used to mark up people's names. (In some cases, the
  <code>b</code> element might be appropriate for names; e.g. in a
  gossip article where the names of famous people are keywords
  rendered with a different style to draw attention to them. In other
  cases, if an element is <em>really</em> needed, the
  <code>span</code> element can be used.)</p>

  <p>A ship is similarly not a work, and the element must not be used
  to mark up ship names (the <code>i</code> element can be used for
  that purpose).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This next example shows a typical use of the <code>cite</code>
   element:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>My favourite book is &lt;cite>The Reality Dysfunction&lt;/cite> by
Peter F. Hamilton. My favourite comic is &lt;cite>Pearls Before
Swine&lt;/cite> by Stephan Pastis. My favourite track is &lt;cite>Jive
Samba&lt;/cite> by the Cannonball Adderley Sextet.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>This is correct usage:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>According to the Wikipedia article &lt;cite>HTML&lt;/cite>, as it
stood in mid-February 2008, leaving attribute values unquoted is
unsafe. This is obviously an over-simplification.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>The following, however, is incorrect usage, as the
   <code>cite</code> element here is containing far more than the
   title of the work:</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- do not copy this example, it is an example of bad usage! -->
&lt;p>According to &lt;cite>the Wikipedia article on HTML&lt;/cite>, as it

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The <code>cite</code> element is obviously a key part of any
   citation in a bibliography, but it is only used to mark the
   title:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;cite>Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/cite>, United Nations,
December 1948.  Adopted by General Assembly resolution 217 A (III).&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <p class="note">A <em>citation</em> is not a <em>quote</em> (for
  which the <code>q</code> element is appropriate).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This is incorrect usage, because <code>cite</code> is not for
   quotes:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;cite>This is wrong!&lt;/cite>, said Ian.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>This is also incorrect usage, because a person is not a
   work:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;q>This is still wrong!&lt;/q>, said &lt;cite>Ian&lt;/cite>.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>The correct usage does not use a <code>cite</code> element:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;q>This is correct&lt;/q>, said Ian.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>As mentioned above, the <code>b</code> element might be relevant
   for marking names as being keywords in certain kinds of
   documents:</p>

   <p>By emphasizing the first word, the statement implies that the
   kind of animal under discussion is in question (maybe someone is
   asserting that dogs are cute):</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats&lt;/em> are cute animals.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Moving the emphasis to the verb, one highlights that the truth
   of the entire sentence is in question (maybe someone is saying cats
   are not cute):</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Cats &lt;em>are&lt;/em> cute animals.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>By moving it to the adjective, the exact nature of the cats
   is reasserted (maybe someone suggested cats were <em>mean</em>
   animals):</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Cats are &lt;em>cute&lt;/em> animals.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Similarly, if someone asserted that cats were vegetables,
   someone correcting this might emphasize the last word:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Cats are cute &lt;em>animals&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>By emphasizing the entire sentence, it becomes clear that the
   speaker is fighting hard to get the point across. This kind of
   emphasis also typically affects the punctuation, hence the
   exclamation mark here.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats are cute animals!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Anger mixed with emphasizing the cuteness could lead to markup
   such as:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats are &lt;em>cute&lt;/em> animals!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></pre>

   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>Uses <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>strong</code> element <span>represents</span> strong
  importance for its contents.</p>

  <p>The relative level of importance of a piece of content is given
  by its number of ancestor <code>strong</code> elements; each
  <code>strong</code> element increases the importance of its
  contents.</p>

  <p>Changing the importance of a piece of text with the
  <code>strong</code> element does not change the meaning of the
  sentence.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Here is an example of a warning notice in a game, with the
   various parts marked up according to how important they are:</p>
   <!-- DO NOT REFLOW THIS EXAMPLE it has been carefully balanced -->

  <p>The <code>small</code> element <span>represents</span> small
  print (part of a document often describing disclaimers, caveats, or
  legal restrictions, such as copyrights or other disadvantages), or
  other side comments.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>small</code> element does not
  "de-emphasize" or lower the importance of text emphasised by the
  <code>em</code> element or marked as important with the
  <code>strong</code> element.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example the footer contains contact information and a
   copyright.</p>

   <pre>&lt;footer>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this second example, the <code>small</code> element is used

second quarter &lt;small>(Full Disclosure: Foo News is a subsidiary of
Example Corp)&lt;/small>, leading to speculation about a third quarter
merger with Demo Group.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>This is distinct from a sidebar, which might be multiple
   paragraphs long and is removed from the main flow of text. In the
   following example, we see a sidebar from the same article. This
   sidebar also has small print, indicating the source of the

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>mark</code> element <span>represents</span> a run of
  text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes,
  due to its relevance in another context. When used in a quotation or
  other block of text referred to from the prose, it indicates a
  highlight that was not originally present but which has been added
  to bring the reader's attention to a part of the text that might not
  have been considered important by the original author when the block
  was originally written, but which is now under previously unexpected
  scrutiny. When used in the main prose of a document, it indicates a
  part of the document that has been highlighted due to its likely
  relevance to the user's current activity.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>This example shows how the <code>mark</code> example can be used
   to bring attention to a particular part of a quotation:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p lang="en-US">Consider the following quote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote lang="en-GB">
 &lt;p>Look around and you will find, no-one's really
 &lt;mark>colour&lt;/mark> blind.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p lang="en-US">As we can tell from the &lt;em>spelling&lt;/em> of the word,
the person writing this quote is clearly not American.&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Another example of the <code>mark</code> element is highlighting
   parts of a document that are matching some search string. If
   someone looked at a document, and the server knew that the user was
   searching for the word "kitten", then the server might return the
   document with one paragraph modified as follows:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>I also have some &lt;mark>kitten&lt;/mark>s who are visiting me
these days. They're really cute. I think they like my garden! Maybe I
should adopt a &lt;mark>kitten&lt;/mark>.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following snippet, a paragraph of text refers to a
   specific part of a code fragment.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The highlighted part below is where the error lies:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>var i: Integer;
begin
   i := &lt;mark>1.1&lt;/mark>;
end.&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This is another example showing the use of <code>mark</code> to
   highlight a part of quoted text that was originally not
   emphasised. In this example, common typographic conventions have
   led the author to explicitly style <code>mark</code> elements in
   quotes to render in italics.</p>

   <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;style>
  blockquote mark, q mark {
    font: inherit; font-style: italic;
    text-decoration: none;
    background: transparent; color: inherit;
  }
  .bubble em {
    font: inherit; font-size: larger;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
 &lt;/style>
 &lt;h1>She knew&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>Did you notice the subtle joke in the joke on panel 4?&lt;/p>
 &lt;blockquote>
  &lt;p class="bubble">I didn't &lt;em>want&lt;/em> to believe. &lt;mark>Of course
  on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack.&lt;/mark> But I
  couldn't admit it until I saw for myself.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/blockquote>
 &lt;p>(Emphasis mine.) I thought that was great. It's so pedantic, yet it
 explains everything neatly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/article></pre>

   <p>Note, incidentally, the distinction between the <code>em</code>
   element in this example, which is part of the original text being
   quoted, and the <code>mark</code> element, which is highlighting a
   part for comment.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example shows the difference between denoting the
   <em>importance</em> of a span of text (<code>strong</code>) as
   opposed to denoting the <em>relevance</em> of a span of text
   (<code>mark</code>). It is an extract from a textbook, where the
   extract has had the parts relevant to the exam highlighted. The
   safety warnings, important though they may be, are apparently not
   relevant to the exam.</p>

   <pre>&lt;h3>Wormhole Physics Introduction&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>&lt;mark>A wormhole in normal conditions can be held open for a
maximum of just under 39 minutes.&lt;/mark> Conditions that can increase
the time include a powerful energy source coupled to one or both of
the gates connecting the wormhole, and a large gravity well (such as a
black hole).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;mark>Momentum is preserved across the wormhole. Electromagnetic
radiation can travel in both directions through a wormhole,
but matter cannot.&lt;/mark>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When a wormhole is created, a vortex normally forms.
&lt;strong>Warning: The vortex caused by the wormhole opening will
annihilate anything in its path.&lt;/strong> Vortexes can be avoided when
using sufficiently advanced dialing technology.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;mark>An obstruction in a gate will prevent it from accepting a
wormhole connection.&lt;/mark>&lt;/p></pre>

  <p>The <code>abbr</code> element <span>represents</span> an
  abbreviation or acronym, optionally with its expansion. The <dfn
  title="attr-abbr-title"><code>title</code></dfn> attribute may be
  used to provide an expansion of the abbreviation. The attribute, if
  specified, must contain an expansion of the abbreviation, and
  nothing else.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The paragraph below contains an abbreviation marked up with the

wish to develop new technologies designed to allow authors to write
and deploy Applications over the World Wide Web.&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
   <p>This paragraph has two abbreviations. Notice how only one is

get the issue counts from past revisions of the specification to

  <p>If an abbreviation is pluralized, the expansion's grammatical
  number (plural vs singular) must match the grammatical number of the
  contents of the element.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here the plural is outside the element, so the expansion is in

&lt;abbr>HTMLWG&lt;/abbr>.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <p>Abbreviations do not have to be marked up using this element. It
  is expected to be useful in the following cases:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Abbreviations for which the author wants to give expansions,
   where using the <code>abbr</code> element with a <code
   title="attr-title">title</code> attribute is an alternative to
   including the expansion inline (e.g. in parentheses).</li>

   <li>Abbreviations that are likely to be unfamiliar to the
   document's readers, for which authors are encouraged to either mark
   up the abbreviation using a <code>abbr</code> element with a <code
   title="attr-title">title</code> attribute or include the expansion
   inline in the text the first time the abbreviation is used.</li>

   <li>Abbreviations whose presence needs to be semantically
   annotated, e.g. so that they can be identified from a style sheet
   and given specific styles, for which the <code>abbr</code> element
   can be used without a <code title="attr-title">title</code>
   attribute.</li>

  </ul>

  <p title="note">Providing an expansion in a <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute once will not necessarily
  cause other <code>abbr</code> elements in the same document with the
  same contents but without a <code title="attr-title">title</code>
  attribute to behave as if they had the same expansion. Every
  <code>abbr</code> element is independent.</p>

  <p>The <code>time</code> element <span>represents</span> a precise

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-time-datetime"><code>datetime</code></dfn>
  attribute, if present, must contain a <span>valid date or time
  string</span> that identifies the date or time being specified.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-time-datetime">datetime</code> attribute
  is not present, then the date or time must be specified in the

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-time-datetime"><code>dateTime</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code

  <p>User agents, to obtain the <dfn
  title="concept-time-date">date</dfn>, <dfn
  title="concept-time-time">time</dfn>, and <dfn
  title="concept-time-timezone">timezone</dfn> represented by a
  <code>time</code> element, must follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the <code title="attr-time-datetime">datetime</code>
   attribute is present, then use the rules to <span>parse a date or
   time string</span> with the flag <i>in attribute</i> from the value
   of that attribute, and let the result be <var

   <li>Otherwise, use the rules to <span>parse a date or time
   string</span> with the flag <i>in content</i> from the element's
   <code>textContent</code>, and let the result be <var
   title="">result</var>.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">result</var> is empty (because the parsing

   unknown, the <span title="concept-time-time">time</span> is unknown,
   and the <span title="concept-time-timezone">timezone</span> is
   unknown.</li>

   <li>Otherwise: if <var title="">result</var> contains a date, then
   that is the <span title="concept-time-date">date</span>; if <var
   title="">result</var> contains a time, then that is the <span
   title="concept-time-time">time</span>; and if <var
   title="">result</var> contains a timezone, then the timezone is the
   element's <span title="concept-time-timezone">timezone</span>. (A
   timezone can only be present if both a date and a time are also
   present.)</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-time-date"><code>date</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return null if the <span
  title="concept-time-date">date</span> is unknown, and otherwise must
  return the time corresponding to midnight UTC (i.e. the first
  second) of the given <span
  title="concept-time-date">date</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-time-time"><code>time</code></dfn> DOM attribute
  must return null if the <span title="concept-time-time">time</span> is
  unknown, and otherwise must return the time corresponding to the
  given <span title="concept-time-time">time</span> of 1970-01-01, with
  the timezone UTC.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-time-timezone"><code>timezone</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return null if the <span
  title="concept-time-timezone">timezone</span> is unknown, and otherwise
  must return the time corresponding to 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC in the
  given <span title="concept-time-timezone">timezone</span>, with the
  timezone set to UTC (i.e. the time corresponding to 1970-01-01 at

   <p>Finally, in the following snippet:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Many people get up at &lt;time>08:00&lt;/time>.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>...the <code>time</code> element's <code
   title="dom-time-date">date</code> attribute would have the value null,
   the <code title="dom-time-time">time</code> attribute would have the
   value 28,800,000ms, and the <code
   title="dom-time-timezone">timezone</code> attribute would return
   null.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="note">The <code>time</code> element is not intended for
  encoding times for which a precise date or time cannot be
  established. For example, it would be inappropriate for encoding
  times like "one millisecond after the big bang", "the early part of
  the Jurassic period", or "a winter around 250 BCE".</p>

  <p>The <code>progress</code> element <span>represents</span> the
  completion progress of a task. The progress is either indeterminate,
  indicating that progress is being made but that it is not clear how
  much more work remains to be done before the task is complete
  (e.g. because the task is waiting for a remote host to respond), or
  the progress is a number in the range zero to a maximum, giving the
  fraction of work that has so far been completed.</p>

  <p>There are two attributes that determine the current task
  completion represented by the element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-progress-value"><code>value</code></dfn>
  attribute specifies how much of the task has been completed, and the
  <dfn title="attr-progress-max"><code>max</code></dfn> attribute
  specifies how much work the task requires in total. The units are
  arbitrary and not specified.</p>

  <p>Instead of using the attributes, authors are recommended to
  include the current value and the maximum value inline as text
  inside the element.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Here is a snippet of a Web application that shows the progress
   of some automated task:</p>
   <pre>&lt;section>
 &lt;h2>Task Progress&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>Progress: &lt;progress>&lt;span id="p">0&lt;/span>%&lt;/progress>&lt;/p>
 &lt;script>
  var progressBar = document.getElementById('p');
  function updateProgress(newValue) {
    progressBar.textContent = newValue;
  }
 &lt;/script>
&lt;/section></pre>
   <p>(The <code>updateProgress()</code> method in this example would
   be called by some other code on the page to update the actual
   progress bar as the task progressed.)</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Author requirements</strong>: The <code
  title="attr-progress-max">max</code> and <code
  title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attributes, when present,
  must have values that are <span title="valid floating point
  number">valid floating point numbers</span>. The <code
  title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute, if present, must
  have a value greater than zero. The <code
  title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute, if present, must
  have a value equal to or greater than zero, and less than or equal
  to the value of the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code>
  attribute, if present, or 1, otherwise.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>progress</code> element is the wrong
  element to use for something that is just a gauge, as opposed to
  task progress. For instance, indicating disk space usage using
  <code>progress</code> would be inappropriate. Instead, the
  <code>meter</code> element is available for such use cases.</p>

  <p><strong>User agent requirements</strong>: User agents must parse
  the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> and <code
  title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attributes' values
  according to the <span>rules for parsing floating point number
  values</span>.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute
  is omitted, then user agents must also parse the
  <code>textContent</code> of the <code>progress</code> element in
  question using the <span>steps for finding one or two numbers of a
  ratio in a string</span>. These steps will return nothing, one
  number, one number with a denominator punctuation character, or two
  numbers.</p>

  <p>Using the results of this processing, user agents must determine
  whether the progress bar is an indeterminate progress bar, or
  whether it is a determinate progress bar, and in the latter case,
  what its current and maximum values are, all as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is
   omitted, and the <code title="attr-progress-value">value</code> is
   omitted, and the results of parsing the <code>textContent</code>
   was nothing, then the progress bar is an indeterminate progress
   bar. Abort these steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, it is a determinate progress bar.</li>

   <li>If the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is
   included, then, if a value could be parsed out of it, then the
   maximum value is that value.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code>
   attribute is absent but the <code
   title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute is present, or,
   if the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is
   present but no value could be parsed from it, then the maximum is
   1.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if neither attribute is included, then, if the
   <code>textContent</code> contained one number with an associated
   denominator punctuation character, then the maximum value is the
   <span>value associated with that denominator punctuation
   character</span>; otherwise, if the <code>textContent</code>
   contained two numbers, the maximum value is the higher of the two
   values; otherwise, the maximum value is 1.</li>

   <li>If the <code title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute
   is present on the element and a value could be parsed out of it,
   that value is the current value of the progress bar. Otherwise, if
   the attribute is present but no value could be parsed from it, the
   current value is zero.</li>

   <li>Otherwise if the <code title="attr-progress-value">value</code>
   attribute is absent and the <code
   title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is present, then, if
   the <code>textContent</code> was parsed and found to contain just
   one number, with no associated denominator punctuation character,
   then the current value is that number. Otherwise, if the <code
   title="attr-progress-value">value</code> attribute is absent and
   the <code title="attr-progress-max">max</code> attribute is present
   then the current value is zero.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if neither attribute is present, then the current
   value is the lower of the one or two numbers that were found in the
   <code>textContent</code> of the element.</li>

   <li>If the maximum value is less than or equal to zero, then it is
   reset to 1.</li>

   <li>If the current value is less than zero, then it is reset to
   zero.</li>

   <li>Finally, if the current value is greater than the maximum
   value, then the current value is reset to the maximum value.</li>

  </ol>

  <p><strong>UA requirements for showing the progress bar</strong>:
  When representing a <code>progress</code> element to the user, the
  UA should indicate whether it is a determinate or indeterminate
  progress bar, and in the former case, should indicate the relative
  position of the current value relative to the maximum value.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-progress-max"><code>max</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="dom-progress-value"><code>value</code></dfn> DOM attributes
  must <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the
  same name. When the relevant content attributes are absent, the DOM
  attributes must return zero. The value parsed from the
  <code>textContent</code> never affects the DOM values.</p>

  <p class="XXX">Would be cool to have the <code
  title="dom-progress-value">value</code> DOM attribute update the
  <code>textContent</code> in-line...</p>

  <p>If the progress bar is an indeterminate progress bar, then the
  <dfn title="dom-progress-position"><code>position</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return &#x2212;1. Otherwise, it must return the result of
  dividing the current value by the maximum value.</p>

  <p>The <code>meter</code> element <span>represents</span> a scalar
  measurement within a known range, or a fractional value; for example
  disk usage, the relevance of a query result, or the fraction of a
  voting population to have selected a particular candidate.</p>

  <p>This is also known as a gauge.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>meter</code> element should not be used to
  indicate progress (as in a progress bar). For that role, HTML
  provides a separate <code>progress</code> element.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>meter</code> element also does not
  represent a scalar value of arbitrary range &mdash; for example, it
  would be wrong to use this to report a weight, or height, unless
  there is a known maximum value.</p>

  <p>There are six attributes that determine the semantics of the
  gauge represented by the element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-meter-min"><code>min</code></dfn> attribute
  specifies the lower bound of the range, and the <dfn
  title="attr-meter-max"><code>max</code></dfn> attribute specifies
  the upper bound. The <dfn
  title="attr-meter-value"><code>value</code></dfn> attribute
  specifies the value to have the gauge indicate as the "measured"
  value.</p>

  <p>The other three attributes can be used to segment the gauge's
  range into "low", "medium", and "high" parts, and to indicate which
  part of the gauge is the "optimum" part. The <dfn
  title="attr-meter-low"><code>low</code></dfn> attribute specifies
  the range that is considered to be the "low" part, and the <dfn
  title="attr-meter-high"><code>high</code></dfn> attribute specifies
  the range that is considered to be the "high" part. The <dfn
  title="attr-meter-optimum"><code>optimum</code></dfn> attribute
  gives the position that is "optimum"; if that is higher than the
  "high" value  then this indicates that the higher the value, the
  better; if it's lower than the "low" mark then it indicates that
  lower values are better, and naturally if it is in between then it
  indicates that neither high nor low values are good.</p>

  <p><strong>Authoring requirements</strong>: The recommended way of
  giving the value is to include it as contents of the element, either
  as two numbers (the higher number represents the maximum, the other
  number the current value, and the minimum is assumed to be zero), or
  as a percentage or similar (using one of the characters such as
  "%"), or as a fraction. However, it is also possible to use the
  attributes to specify these values.</p>

  <p>One of the following conditions, along with all the requirements
  that are listed with that condition, must be met:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>There are exactly two numbers in the contents of the element,
   and the <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code>, <code
   title="attr-meter-min">min</code>, and <code
   title="attr-meter-max">max</code> attributes are all omitted</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If specified, the <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code>,
    <code title="attr-meter-high">high</code>, and <code
    title="attr-meter-optimum">optimum</code> attributes must have
    values greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to the
    bigger of the two numbers in the contents of the element.</p>

    <p>If both the <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code> and <code
    title="attr-meter-high">high</code> attributes are specified, then
    the <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code> attribute's value must
    be less than or equal to the value of the <code
    title="attr-meter-high">high</code> attribute.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>There is exactly one number followed by zero or more
   <span>White_Space</span> characters and a <span>valid denominator
   punctuation character</span> in the contents of the element, and
   the <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code>, <code
   title="attr-meter-min">min</code>, and <code
   title="attr-meter-max">max</code> attributes are all omitted</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If specified, the <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code>,
    <code title="attr-meter-high">high</code>, and <code

    <p>If both the <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code> and <code

    the <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code> attribute's value must
    be less than or equal to the value of the <code
    title="attr-meter-high">high</code> attribute.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>There is exactly one number in the contents of the element, and
   the <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code> attribute is
   omitted</dt>

   <dt>There are no numbers in the contents of the element, and the
   <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code> attribute is
   specified</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-min">min</code> attribute
    attribute is specified, then the <var title="">minimum</var> is
    that attribue's value; otherwise, it is 0.</p>

    <p>If the <code title="attr-meter-max">max</code> attribute
    attribute is specified, then the <var title="">maximum</var> is
    that attribue's value; otherwise, it is 1.</p>

    <p>If there is exactly one number in the contents of the element,
    then <var title="">value</var> is that number; otherwise, <var
    title="">value</var> is the value of the <code
    title="attr-meter-value">value</code> attribute.</p>

    <p>The following inequalities must hold, as applicable:</p>

    <ul class="brief">
     <li><var title="">minimum</var> &le; <var title="">value</var> &le; <var title="">maximum</var></li>
     <li><var title="">minimum</var> &le; <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code> &le; <var title="">maximum</var> (if <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code> is specified)</li>

    </ul>

    <p>If both the <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code> and <code
    title="attr-meter-high">high</code> attributes are specified, then
    the <code title="attr-meter-low">low</code> attribute's value must
    be less than or equal to the value of the <code
    title="attr-meter-high">high</code> attribute.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>For the purposes of these requirements, a number is a sequence of
  characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE
  (9), optionally including with a single U+002E FULL STOP character
  (.), and separated from other numbers by at least one character that
  isn't any of those; interpreted as a base ten number.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-meter-value">value</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-min">min</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-low">low</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-high">high</code>, <code
  title="attr-meter-max">max</code>, and <code
  title="attr-meter-optimum">optimum</code> attributes, when present,
  must have values that are <span title="valid floating point
  number">valid floating point numbers</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">If no minimum or maximum is specified, then the
  range is assumed to be 0..1, and the value thus has to be within
  that range.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following examples all represent a measurement of three
   quarters (of the maximum of whatever is being measured):</p>

   <pre>&lt;meter>75%&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter>750&#x2030;&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter>3/4&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter>6 blocks used (out of 8 total)&lt;/meter>

&lt;meter>&lt;object data="graph75.png">0.75&lt;/object>&lt;/meter>
&lt;meter min="0" max="100" value="75">&lt;/meter></pre>

   <p>The following example is incorrect use of the element, because
   it doesn't give a range (and since the default maximum is 1, both
   of the gauges would end up looking maxed out):</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;p>The grapefruit pie had a radius of &lt;meter>12cm&lt;/meter>
and a height of &lt;meter>2cm&lt;/meter>.&lt;/p> &lt;!-- <strong>BAD!</strong> --></pre>

   <p>Instead, one would either not include the meter element, or use
   the meter element with a defined range to give the dimensions in
   context compared to other pies:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The grapefruit pie had a radius of 12cm and a height of
2cm.&lt;/p>
&lt;dl>
 &lt;dt>Radius: &lt;dd> &lt;meter min=0 max=20 value=12>12cm&lt;/meter>
 &lt;dt>Height: &lt;dd> &lt;meter min=0 max=10 value=2>2cm&lt;/meter>
&lt;/dl></pre>

  </div>

  <p>There is no explicit way to specify units in the
  <code>meter</code> element, but the units may be specified in the
  <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute in free-form text.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The example above could be extended to mention the units:</p>

   <pre>&lt;dl>
 &lt;dt>Radius: &lt;dd> &lt;meter min=0 max=20 value=12 title="centimeters">12cm&lt;/meter>
 &lt;dt>Height: &lt;dd> &lt;meter min=0 max=10 value=2 title="centimeters">2cm&lt;/meter>

  steps will return nothing, one number, one number with a denominator
  punctuation character, or two numbers.</p>

  <p>User agents must then use all these numbers to obtain values for
  six points on the gauge, as follows. (The order in which these are

    if it was not specified, but either or both of the <code

  </dl>

  <p>All of which will result in the following inequalities all being
  true:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li>minimum value &le; actual value &le; maximum value</li>
   <li>minimum value &le; low boundary &le; high boundary &le; maximum value</li>
   <li>minimum value &le; optimum point &le; maximum value</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>UA requirements for regions of the gauge</strong>: If the
  optimum point is equal to the low boundary or the high boundary, or
  anywhere in between them, then the region between the low and high
  boundaries of the gauge must be treated as the optimum region, and
  the low and high parts, if any, must be treated as
  suboptimal. Otherwise, if the optimum point is less than the low
  boundary, then the region between the minimum value and the low
  boundary must be treated as the optimum region, the region between
  the low boundary and the high boundary must be treated as a
  suboptimal region, and the region between the high boundary and the
  maximum value must be treated as an even less good region. Finally,
  if the optimum point is higher than the high boundary, then the
  situation is reversed; the region between the high boundary and the
  maximum value must be treated as the optimum region, the region
  between the high boundary and the low boundary must be treated as a
  suboptimal region, and the remaining region between the low boundary
  and the minimum value must be treated as an even less good
  region.</p>

  <p><strong>UA requirements for showing the gauge</strong>: When
  representing a <code>meter</code> element to the user, the UA should
  indicate the relative position of the actual value to the minimum
  and maximum values, and the relationship between the actual value
  and the three regions of the gauge.</p>

  <p>The <code>code</code> element <span>represents</span> a fragment
  of computer code. This could be an XML element name, a filename, a
  computer program, or any other string that a computer would
  recognize.</p>

  <p>Although there is no formal way to indicate the language of
  computer code being marked up, authors who wish to mark
  <code>code</code> elements with the language used, e.g. so that
  syntax highlighting scripts can use the right rules, may do so by
  adding a class prefixed with "<code title="">language-</code>" to
  the element.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example shows how the element can be used in a
   paragraph to mark up element names and computer code, including
   punctuation.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The &lt;code>code&lt;/code> element represents a fragment of computer
code.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When you call the &lt;code>activate()&lt;/code> method on the
&lt;code>robotSnowman&lt;/code> object, the eyes glow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The example below uses the &lt;code>begin&lt;/code> keyword to indicate
the start of a statement block. It is paired with an &lt;code>end&lt;/code>
keyword, which is followed by the &lt;code>.&lt;/code> punctuation character
(full stop) to indicate the end of the program.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example shows how a block of code could be marked
   up using the <code>pre</code> and <code>code</code> elements.</p>

   <pre>&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-pascal">var i: Integer;
begin
   i := 1;
end.&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></pre>

   <p>A class is used in that example to indicate the language
   used.</p>

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>var</code> element <span>represents</span> a
  variable. This could be an actual variable in a mathematical
  expression or programming context, or it could just be a term used
  as a placeholder in prose.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>In the paragraph below, the letter "n" is being used as a
   variable in prose:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>If there are &lt;var>n&lt;/var> pipes leading to the ice
cream factory then I expect at &lt;em>least&lt;/em> &lt;var>n&lt;/var>
flavours of ice cream to be available for purchase!&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <p>For mathematics, in particular for anything beyond the simplest
  of expressions, MathML is more appropriate. However, the
  <code>var</code> element can still be used to refer to specific
  variables that are then mentioned in MathML expressions.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, an equation is shown, with a legend that
   references the variables in the equation. The expression itself is
   marked up with MathML, but the variables are mentioned in the
   figure's legend using <code>var</code>.</p>

   <pre>&lt;figure>

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>kbd</code> element <span>represents</span> user input
  (typically keyboard input, although it may also be used to represent
  other input, such as voice commands).</p>

  <p>When the <code>kbd</code> element is nested inside a
  <code>samp</code> element, it represents the input as it was echoed
  by the system.</p>

  <p>When the <code>kbd</code> element <em>contains</em> a
  <code>samp</code> element, it represents input based on system
  output, for example invoking a menu item.</p>

  <p>When the <code>kbd</code> element is nested inside another
  <code>kbd</code> element, it represents an actual key or other
  single unit of input as appropriate for the input mechanism.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Here the <code>kbd</code> element is used to indicate keys to press:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>To make George eat an apple, press &lt;kbd>&lt;kbd>Shift&lt;/kbd>+&lt;kbd>F3&lt;/kbd>&lt;/kbd>&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>In this second example, the user is told to pick a particular
   menu item. The outer <code>kbd</code> element marks up a block of
   input, with the inner <code>kbd</code> elements representing each
   individual step of the input, and the <code>samp</code> elements
   inside them indicating that the steps are input based on something
   being displayed by the system, in this case menu labels:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>To make George eat an apple, select
    &lt;kbd>&lt;kbd>&lt;samp>File&lt;/samp>&lt;/kbd>|&lt;kbd>&lt;samp>Eat Apple...&lt;/samp>&lt;/kbd>&lt;/kbd>

   <dd><span>Global attributes</span></dd>
   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>Uses <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>sup</code> element <span>represents</span> a
  superscript and the <code>sub</code> element <span>represents</span>
  a subscript.</p>

  <p>These elements must be used only to mark up typographical
  conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical
  presentation for presentation's sake. For example, it would be
  inappropriate for the <code>sub</code> and <code>sup</code> elements
  to be used in the name of the LaTeX document preparation system. In
  general, authors should use these elements only if the
  <em>absence</em> of those elements would change the meaning of the
  content.</p>

  <p>When the <code>sub</code> element is used inside a
  <code>var</code> element, it represents the subscript that
  identifies the variable in a family of variables.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <pre>&lt;p>The coordinate of the &lt;var>i&lt;/var>th point is
(&lt;var>x&lt;sub>&lt;var>i&lt;/var>&lt;/sub>&lt;/var>, &lt;var>y&lt;sub>&lt;var>i&lt;/var>&lt;/sub>&lt;/var>).
For example, the 10th point has coordinate
(&lt;var>x&lt;sub>10&lt;/sub>&lt;/var>, &lt;var>y&lt;sub>10&lt;/sub>&lt;/var>).&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <p>In certain languages, superscripts are part of the typographical
  conventions for some abbreviations.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <pre>&lt;p>The most beautiful women are
&lt;span lang="fr">&lt;abbr>M&lt;sup>lle&lt;/sup>&lt;/abbr> Gwendoline&lt;/span> and 
&lt;span lang="fr">&lt;abbr>M&lt;sup>me&lt;/sup>&lt;/abbr> Denise&lt;/span>.&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Mathematical expressions often use subscripts and superscripts.
  Authors are encouraged to use MathML for marking up mathematics, but
  authors may opt to use <code>sub</code> and <code>sup</code> if
  detailed mathematical markup is not desired. <a
  href="#refsMathML">[MathML]</a></p>

  <div class="example">
   <pre>&lt;var>E&lt;/var>=&lt;var>m&lt;/var>&lt;var>c&lt;/var>&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup></pre>
   <pre>f(&lt;var>x&lt;/var>, &lt;var>n&lt;/var>) = log&lt;sub>4&lt;/sub>&lt;var>x&lt;/var>&lt;sup>&lt;var>n&lt;/var>&lt;/sup></pre>

  <p>The <code>span</code> element doesn't mean anything on its own,
  but can be useful when used together with other attributes,
  e.g. <code title="attr-class">class</code>, <code
  title="attr-lang">lang</code>, or <code
  title="attr-dir">dir</code>. It <span>represents</span> its

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>i</code> element <span>represents</span> a span of text
  in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal
  prose, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an
  idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, or
  some other prose whose typical typographic presentation is
  italicized.</p>

  <p>Terms in languages different from the main text should be
  annotated with <code title="attr-lang">lang</code> attributes (<code
  title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code> in XML).</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The examples below show uses of the <code>i</code> element:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>The &lt;i class="taxonomy">Felis silvestris catus&lt;/i> is cute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The term &lt;i>prose content&lt;/i> is defined above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a certain &lt;i lang="fr">je ne sais quoi&lt;/i> in the air.&lt;/p></pre>
   <p>In the following example, a dream sequence is marked up using
   <code>i</code> elements.</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>Raymond tried to sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;i>The ship sailed away on Thursday&lt;/i>, he
dreamt. &lt;i>The ship had many people aboard, including a beautiful
princess called Carey. He watched her, day-in, day-out, hoping she
would notice him, but she never did.&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;i>Finally one night he picked up the courage to speak with
her&mdash;&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Raymond woke with a start as the fire alarm rang out.&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Authors are encouraged to use the <code
  title="attr-class">class</code> attribute on the <code>i</code>
  element to identify why the element is being used, so that if the
  style of a particular use (e.g. dream sequences as opposed to
  taxonomic terms) is to be changed at a later date, the author
  doesn't have to go through the entire document (or series of related
  documents) annotating each use. Similarly, authors are encouraged to
  consider whether other elements might be more applicable than the
  <code>i</code> element, for instance the <code>em</code> element for
  marking up stress emphasis, or the <code>dfn</code> element to mark
  up the defining instance of a term.</p>

  <p class="note">Style sheets can be used to format <code>i</code>
  elements, just like any other element can be restyled. Thus, it is
  not the case that content in <code>i</code> elements will
  necessarily be italicized.</p>

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>b</code> element <span>represents</span> a span of text
  to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying
  any extra importance, such as key words in a document abstract,
  product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical
  typographic presentation is boldened.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following example shows a use of the <code>b</code> element
   to highlight key words without marking them up as important:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>The &lt;b>frobonitor&lt;/b> and &lt;b>barbinator&lt;/b> components are fried.&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
   <p>In the following example, objects in a text adventure are
   highlighted as being special by use of the <code>b</code>
   element.</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>You enter a small room. Your &lt;b>sword&lt;/b> glows
brighter. A &lt;b>rat&lt;/b> scurries past the corner wall.&lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Another case where the <code>b</code> element is appropriate is
   in marking up the lede (or lead) sentence or paragraph. The
   following example shows how a <a
   href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/north_east/7101506.stm">BBC
   article about kittens adopting a rabbit as their own</a> could be
   marked up using HTML5 elements:</p>

 &lt;h2>Kittens 'adopted' by pet rabbit&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>&lt;b>Six abandoned kittens have found an unexpected new
 mother figure &mdash; a pet rabbit.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>Veterinary nurse Melanie Humble took the three-week-old
 kittens to her Aberdeen home.&lt;/p>
<i>[...]</i></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <code>b</code> element should be used as a last resort when
  no other element is more appropriate. In particular, headers should
  use the <code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code> elements, stress emphasis
  should use the <code>em</code> element, importance should be denoted
  with the <code>strong</code> element, and text marked or highlighted
  should use the <code>mark</code> element.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following would be <em>incorrect</em> usage:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;b>WARNING!&lt;/b> Do not frob the barbinator!&lt;/p></pre>
   <p>In the previous example, the correct element to use would have
   been <code>strong</code>, not <code>b</code>.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="note">Style sheets can be used to format <code>b</code>
  elements, just like any other element can be restyled. Thus, it is

  <p>Authors must specify the <code title="attr-dir">dir</code>

  <p>If the element has the <code title="attr-dir">dir</code>

  element, and a U+202C POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING at the end of the
  element.</p>

  <p>The requirements on handling the <code>bdo</code> element for the
  bidi algorithm may be implemented indirectly through the style
  layer. For example, an HTML+CSS user agent should implement these
  requirements by implementing the CSS <code>unicode-bidi</code>
  property. <a href="#refsCSS21">[CSS21]</a></p>

  <p>The <code>ruby</code> element allows one or more spans of
  phrasing content to be marked with ruby annotations. Ruby
  annotations are short runs of text presented alongside base text,
  primarily used in East Asian typography as a guide for
  pronounciation or to include other annotations. In Japanese, this
  form of typography is also known as <i>furigana</i>.</p>

  <p>A <code>ruby</code> element <span>represents</span> the spans of
  phrasing content it contains, ignoring all the child <code>rt</code>
  and <code>rp</code> elements and their descendants. Those spans of
  phrasing content have associated annotations created using the
  <code>rt</code> element.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <!-- this is the kanji for the word "kanji" ("chinese character") in japanese -->
   <!-- in japanese, ruby-like typography is called "furigana" -->

  </dl>

  <p>The <code>rt</code> element marks the ruby text component of a
  ruby annotation.</p>

  <p>An <code>rt</code> element that is a child of a <code>ruby</code>
  element <span>represents</span> an annotation (given by its
  children) for the zero or more nodes of phrasing content that
  immediately precedes it in the <code>ruby</code> element, ignoring
  <code>rp</code> elements.</p>

  <p>An <code>rt</code> element that is not a child of a
  <code>ruby</code> element represents the same thing as its
  children.</p>


  <h4>The <dfn><code>rp</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Categories</dt>
   <dd>None.</dd>
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>
   <dd>As a child of a <code>ruby</code> element, either immediately before or immediately after an <code>rt</code> element.</dd>
   <dt>Content model:</dt>
   <dd>If the <code>rp</code> element is immediately after an <code>rt</code> element that is immediately preceded by another <code>rp</code> element: a single character from Unicode character class Pe.</dd>

   <dt>Content attributes:</dt>
   <dd><span>Global attributes</span></dd>
   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>Uses <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>rp</code> element can be used to provide parentheses
  around a ruby text component of a ruby annotation, to be shown by
  user agents that don't support ruby annotations.</p>

  <p>An <code>rp</code> element that is a child of a <code>ruby</code>
  element <span>represents</span> nothing and it and its contents must
  be ignored. An <code>rp</code> element whose parent element is not a
  <code>ruby</code> element <span>represents</span> its children.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The example above, in which each ideograph in the text <span
   lang="ja">&#28450;&#23383;</span> is annotated with its kanji
   reading, could be expanded to use <code>rp</code> so that in legacy
   user agents the readings are in parentheses:</p>

   <pre lang="ja">... 
&lt;ruby>
 &#28450; &lt;rp>(&lt;/rp>&lt;rt>&#12363;&#12435;&lt;/rt>&lt;rp>)&lt;/rp>
 &#23383; &lt;rp>(&lt;/rp>&lt;rt>&#12376;&lt;/rt>&lt;rp>)&lt;/rp>
&lt;/ruby>
...</pre>

   <p>In conforming user agents the rendering would be as above, but
   in user agents that do not support ruby, the rendering would
   be:</p>

   <pre lang="ja">... &#28450; (&#12363;&#12435;) &#23383; (&#12376;) ...</pre>

  </div>


  <h4>Usage summary</h4>

  <p class="XXX">We need to summarize the various elements, in
  particular to distinguish b/i/em/strong/var/q/mark/cite.</p>

  <!-- XXX when you do this, also reorder the elements in this section
  to bring the related ones closer together. -->


  <h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4>

  <p>HTML does not have a dedicated mechanism for marking up
  footnotes. Here are the recommended alternatives.</p>

  <p>For short inline annotations, the <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute should be used.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, two parts of a dialog are annotated.</p>

   <pre>&lt;dialog>
 &lt;dt>Customer
 &lt;dd>Hello! I wish to register a complaint. Hello. Miss?
 &lt;dt>Shopkeeper
 &lt;dd>&lt;span title="Colloquial pronunciation of 'What do you'"
 >Watcha&lt;/span> mean, miss?
 &lt;dt>Customer
 &lt;dd>Uh, I'm sorry, I have a cold. I wish to make a complaint.
 &lt;dt>Shopkeeper
 &lt;dd>Sorry, &lt;span title="This is, of course, a lie.">we're
 closing for lunch&lt;/span>.
&lt;/dialog></pre>

  </div>

  <p>For longer annotations, the <code>a</code> element should be
  used, pointing to an element later in the document. The convention
  is that the contents of the link be a number in square brackets.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, a footnote in the dialog links to a paragraph
   below the dialog. The paragraph then reciprocally links back to the
   dialog, allowing the user to return to the location of the
   footnote.</p>

   <pre>&lt;dialog>
 &lt;dt>Announcer
 &lt;dd>Number 16: The &lt;i>hand&lt;/i>.
 &lt;dt>Interviewer
 &lt;dd>Good evening. I have with me in the studio tonight Mr
 Norman St John Polevaulter, who for the past few years has
 been contradicting people. Mr Polevaulter, why &lt;em>do&lt;/em>
 you contradict people?
 &lt;dt>Norman
 &lt;dd>I don't. &lt;a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]&lt;/a>
 &lt;dt>Interviewer
 &lt;dd>You told me you did!
&lt;/dialog>
&lt;section>
 &lt;p id="fn1">&lt;a href="#r1">[1]&lt;/a> This is, naturally, a lie,
 but paradoxically if it were true he could not say so without
 contradicting the interviewer and thus making it false.&lt;/p>
&lt;/section></pre>

  </div>

  <p>For side notes, longer annotations that apply to entire sections
  of the text rather than just specific words or sentences, the
  <code>aside</code> element should be used.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, a sidebar is given after a dialog, giving some
   context to the dialog.</p>

   <pre>&lt;dialog>
 &lt;dt>Customer
 &lt;dd>I will not buy this record, it is scratched.
 &lt;dt>Shopkeeper
 &lt;dd>I'm sorry?
 &lt;dt>Customer
 &lt;dd>I will not buy this record, it is scratched.
 &lt;dt>Shopkeeper
 &lt;dd>No no no, this's'a tobacconist's.
&lt;/dialog>
&lt;aside>
 &lt;p>In 1970, the British Empire lay in ruins, and foreign
 nationalists frequented the streets &mdash; many of them Hungarians
 (not the streets &mdash; the foreign nationals). Sadly, Alexander
 Yalt has been publishing incompetently-written phrase books.
&lt;/aside></pre>

  </div>



  <h3>Edits</h3>

  <p>The <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements represent
  edits to the document.</p>


  <h4>The <dfn><code>ins</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Categories</dt>
   <dd><span>Flow content</span>.</dd>
   <dd>When the element only contains <span>phrasing content</span>: <span>phrasing content</span>.</dd>
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>
   <dd>Where <span>phrasing content</span> is expected.</dd>
   <dt>Content model:</dt>
   <dd><span>Transparent</span>.</dd>
   <dt>Content attributes:</dt>
   <dd><span>Global attributes</span></dd>
   <dd><code title="attr-mod-cite">cite</code></dd>
   <dd><code title="attr-mod-datetime">datetime</code></dd>
   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>Uses the <code>HTMLModElement</code> interface.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>ins</code> element <span>represents</span> an addition
  to the document.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following represents the addition of a single paragraph:</p>

   <pre>&lt;aside>
 &lt;ins>
  &lt;p> I like fruit. &lt;/p>
 &lt;/ins>
&lt;/aside></pre>

   <p>As does this, because everything in the <code>aside</code>
   element here counts as <span>phrasing content</span> and therefore
   there is just one <span>paragraph</span>:</p>

   <pre>&lt;aside>
 &lt;ins>
  Apples are &lt;em>tasty&lt;/em>.
 &lt;/ins>
 &lt;ins>
  So are pears.
 &lt;/ins>
&lt;/aside></pre>

  </div>

  <p><code>ins</code> elements should not cross <span
  title="paragraph">implied paragraph</span> boundaries.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example represents the addition of two paragraphs,
   the second of which was inserted in two parts. The first
   <code>ins</code> element in this example thus crosses a paragraph
   boundary, which is considered poor form.</p>

   <pre>&lt;aside>
 &lt;ins datetime="2005-03-16T00:00Z">
  &lt;p> I like fruit. &lt;/p>
  Apples are &lt;em>tasty&lt;/em>.
 &lt;/ins>
 &lt;ins datetime="2007-12-19T00:00Z">
  So are pears.
 &lt;/ins>
&lt;/aside></pre>

   <p>Here is a better way of marking this up. It uses more elements,
   but none of the elements cross implied paragraph boundaries.</p>

   <pre>&lt;aside>
 &lt;ins datetime="2005-03-16T00:00Z">
  &lt;p> I like fruit. &lt;/p>
 &lt;/ins>
 &lt;ins datetime="2005-03-16T00:00Z">
  Apples are &lt;em>tasty&lt;/em>.
 &lt;/ins>
 &lt;ins datetime="2007-12-19T00:00Z">
  So are pears.
 &lt;/ins>
&lt;/aside></pre>

   <!-- Those dates aren't random. They're the start and end of
   something. Can you guess what? -->

  <h4>The <dfn><code>del</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Categories</dt>
   <dd><span>Flow content</span>.</dd>
   <dd>When the element only contains <span>phrasing content</span>: <span>phrasing content</span>.</dd>
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>

   <dd><code title="attr-mod-datetime">datetime</code></dd>
   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>Uses the <code>HTMLModElement</code> interface.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>del</code> element <span>represents</span> a removal
  from the document.</p>

  <p><code>del</code> elements should not cross <span
  title="paragraph">implied paragraph</span> boundaries.</p>


  <h4>Attributes common to <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-mod-cite"><code>cite</code></dfn> attribute
  may be used to specify the address of a document that explains the
  change. When that document is long, for instance the minutes of a
  meeting, authors are encouraged to include a fragment identifier
  pointing to the specific part of that document that discusses the
  change.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-mod-cite">cite</code> attribute is
  present, it must be a <span>valid URL</span> that explains the
  change. To obtain the corresponding citation link, the value of the
  attribute must be <span title="resolve a url">resolved</span>
  relative to the element. User agents should allow users to follow
  such citation links.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-mod-datetime"><code>datetime</code></dfn>
  attribute may be used to specify the time and date of the change.</p>

  <p>If present, the <code title="attr-mod-datetime">datetime</code>
  attribute must be a <span>valid global date and time string</span>
  value.</p>

  <p>User agents must parse the <code
  title="attr-mod-datetime">datetime</code> attribute according to the
  <span>parse a global date and time string</span> algorithm. If that
  doesn't return a time, then the modification has no associated
  timestamp (the value is non-conforming; it is not a <span>valid
  global date and time string</span>). Otherwise, the modification is
  marked as having been made at the given datetime. User agents should
  use the associated timezone information to determine which timezone
  to present the given datetime in.</p>

  <p>The <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements must implement
  the <code>HTMLModElement</code> interface:</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>HTMLModElement</dfn> : <span>HTMLElement</span> {
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-mod-cite">cite</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-mod-datetime">dateTime</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-mod-cite"><code>cite</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the element's <code
  title="attr-mod-cite">cite</code> content attribute. The <dfn
  title="dom-mod-datetime"><code>dateTime</code></dfn> DOM attribute
  must <span>reflect</span> the element's <code
  title="">datetime</code> content attribute.</p>


  <h4>Edits and paragraphs</h4>

  <p>Since the <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements do not
  affect <span title="paragraph">paragraphing</span>, it is possible,
  in some cases where paragraphs are <span
  title="paragraph">implied</span> (without explicit <code>p</code>
  elements), for an <code>ins</code> or <code>del</code> element to
  span both an entire paragraph or other non-<span>phrasing
  content</span> elements and part of another paragraph.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>

  <pre>&lt;section>
 &lt;ins>
  &lt;p>
   This is a paragraph that was inserted.
  &lt;/p>
  This is another paragraph whose first sentence was inserted
  at the same time as the paragraph above.
 &lt;/ins>
 This is a second sentence, which was there all along.
&lt;/section></pre>

  <p>By only wrapping some paragraphs in <code>p</code> elements, one
  can even get the end of one paragraph, a whole second paragraph,
  and the start of a third paragraph to be covered by the same
  <code>ins</code> or <code>del</code> element (though this is very
  confusing, and not considered good practice):</p>

  <pre>&lt;section>
 This is the first paragraph. &lt;ins>This sentence was
 inserted.
 &lt;p>This second paragraph was inserted.&lt;/p>
 This sentence was inserted too.&lt;/ins> This is the
 third paragraph in this example.
&lt;/section></pre>

  <p>However, due to the way <span title="paragraph">implied
  paragraphs</span> are defined, it is not possible to mark up the
  end of one paragraph and the start of the very next one using the
  same <code>ins</code> or <code>del</code> element. You instead have
  to use one (or two) <code>p</code> element(s) and two
  <code>ins</code> or <code>del</code> elements:

  <p>For example:</p>

  <pre>&lt;section>
 &lt;p>This is the first paragraph. &lt;del>This sentence was
 deleted.&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>&lt;del>This sentence was deleted too.&lt;/del> That
 sentence needed a separate &amp;lt;del&amp;gt; element.&lt;/p>
&lt;/section></pre>

  <p>Partly because of the confusion described above, authors are
  strongly recommended to always mark up all paragraphs with the
  <code>p</code> element, and to not have any <code>ins</code> or
  <code>del</code> elements that cross across any <span
  title="paragraph">implied paragraphs</span>.</p>


  <h4>Edits and lists</h4>

  <p>The content models of the <code>ol</code> and <code>ul</code>
  elements do not allow <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements
  as children. Lists always represent all their items, including items
  that would otherwise have been marked as deleted.</p>

  <p>To indicate that an item is inserted or deleted, an
  <code>ins</code> or <code>del</code> element can be wrapped around
  the contents of the <code>li</code> element. To indicate that an
  item has been replaced by another, a single <code>li</code> element
  can have one or more <code>del</code> elements followed by one or
  more <code>ins</code> elements.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a list that started empty had items
   added and removed from it over time. The bits in the example that
   have been emphasised show the parts that are the "current" state of
   the list. The list item numbers don't take into account the edits,
   though.</p>

  <p>The <code>figure</code> element <span>represents</span> some
  <span>flow content</span>, optionally with a caption, which can be
  moved away from the main flow of the document without affecting the
  document's meaning.</p>

  <p>The element can thus be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams,
  photos, code listings, etc, that are referred to from the main
  content of the document, but that could, without affecting the flow
  of the document, be moved away from that primary content, e.g. to
  the side of the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix.</p>

  <p>The first <code>legend</code> element child of the element, if
  any, represents the caption of the <code>figure</code> element's
  contents. If there is no child <code>legend</code> element, then
  there is no caption.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the element's contents, if any, represents the
  content.</p>

  <p>An <code>img</code> element represents an image.</p>

  <p>The image given by the <dfn
  title="attr-img-src"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute is the
  embedded content, and the value of the <dfn
  title="attr-img-alt"><code>alt</code></dfn> attribute is the
  <code>img</code> element's <span>fallback content</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute must be
  present, and must contain a <span>valid URL</span> referencing a
  non-interactive, optionally animated, image resource that is neither
  paged nor scripted. If the <i>base URI of the element</i> is the
  same as <span>the document's address</span>, then the <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute's value must not be the
  empty string.</p>

  <p class="note">Images can thus be static bitmaps (e.g. PNGs, GIFs,
  JPEGs), single-page vector documents (single-page PDFs, XML files
  with an SVG root element), animated bitmaps (APNGs, animated GIFs),
  animated vector graphics (XML files with an SVG root element that
  use declarative SMIL animation), and so forth. However, this also
  precludes SVG files with script, multipage PDF files, interactive
  MNG files, HTML documents, plain text documents, and so forth.</p>

  <p>The requirements on the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute's value are described <a href="#alt">in the next
  section</a>.</p>

  <p class="XXX">There has been some suggestion that the <code
  title="">longdesc</code> attribute from HTML4 should be
  included. This has been considered and rejected in the past, but if
  new evidence is found showing the attribute to actually help users
  rather than harm them, it may be reconsidered.</p>

  <p>The <code>img</code> must not be used as a layout tool. In
  particular, <code>img</code> elements should not be used to display
  fully transparent images, as they rarely convey meaning and rarely
  add anything useful to the document.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Unless the user agent cannot support images, or its support for
  images has been disabled, or the user agent only fetches elements on
  demand, or the element's <code title="attr-img-src">src</code>
  attribute has a value that is an <i>ignored self-reference</i>,
  then, when an <code>img</code> is created with a <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute, and whenever the <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute is set subsequently, the
  user agent must <span title="resolve a url">resolve</span> the value
  of that attribute, relative to the element, and if that is
  successful must then <span>fetch</span> that resource.</p> <!-- Note
  how this does NOT happen when the base URL changes. -->

  <p>The <code title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute's value is an
  <i>ignored self-reference</i> if its value is the empty string, and
  the <i>base URI of the element</i> is the same as <span>the
  document's address</span>.</p>

  <p>Fetching the image must <span>delay the <code
  title="event-load">load</code> event</span>.</p>

  <p class="warning">This, unfortunately, can be used to perform a
  rudimentary port scan of the user's local network (especially in
  conjunction with scripting, though scripting isn't actually
  necessary to carry out such an attack). User agents may implement
  <span title="origin">cross-origin</span> access control policies
  that mitigate this attack.</p>

  <p>If the image's type is a supported image type, and the image is a
  valid image of that type, then the image is said to be
  <i>available</i> (this affects exactly what the element represents,
  as defined below). This can be true even before the image is
  completely downloaded, if the user agent supports incremental
  rendering of images; in such cases, each <span
  title="concept-task">task</span> that is <span title="queue a
  task">queued</span> by the <span>networking task source</span> while
  the image is being <span title="fetch">fetched</span> must update
  the presentation of the image appropriately.</p>

  <p>If the image was not fetched (e.g. because the UA's image support
  is disabled, or because the <code title="attr-img-src">src</code>
  attribute's value is an <i>ignored self-reference</i>), or if the
  conditions in the previous paragraph are not met, then the image is
  <em>not</em> <i>available</i>.</p>

  <p class="note">An image might be <i>available</i> in one
  <span>view</span> but not another. For instance, a
  <code>Document</code> could be rendered by a screen reader providing
  a speech synthesis view of the output of a Web browser using the
  screen media. In this case, the image would be <i>available</i> in
  the Web browser's screen view, but <em>not</em> <i>available</i> in
  the screen reader's view.</p>

  <p>Whether the image is fetched successfully or not (e.g. whether
  the response code was a 2xx code <span
  title="concept-http-equivalent-codes">or equivalent</span>) must be
  ignored when determining the image's type and whether it is a valid
  image.</p>

  <p class="note">This allows servers to return images with error
  responses, and have them displayed.</p>

  <p>The user agents should apply the <span title="Content-Type
  sniffing: image">image sniffing rules</span> to determine the type
  of the image, with the image's <span title="Content-Type">associated
  Content-Type headers</span> giving the <var title="">official
  type</var>. If these rules are not applied, then the type of the
  image must be the type given by the image's <span
  title="Content-Type">associated Content-Type headers</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents must not support non-image resources with the
  <code>img</code> element (e.g. XML files whose root element is an
  HTML element). User agents must not run executable code
  (e.g. scripts) embedded in the image resource. User agents must only
  display the first page of a multipage resource (e.g. a PDF
  file). User agents must not allow the resource to act in an
  interactive fashion, but should honour any animation in the
  resource.</p>

  <p>This specification does not specify which image types are to be
  supported.</p>

  <p>The <span title="concept-task">task</span> that is <span
  title="queue a task">queued</span> by the <span>networking task
  source</span> once the resource has been <span
  title="fetch">fetched</span>, must, if the download was successful
  and the image is <i>available</i>, <span>queue a task</span> to
  <span>fire a <code title="event-load">load</code> event</span> on
  the <code>img</code> element (this happens after <code
  title="dom-img-complete">complete</code> starts returning true); and
  otherwise, if the fetching process fails without a response from the
  remote server, or completes but the image is not a valid or
  supported image, <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire an <code
  title="event-error">error</code> event</span> on the
  <code>img</code> element.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>What an <code>img</code> element represents depends on the <code

  <p>User agents may always provide the user with the option to

  map. This affects how events are handled on the corresponding

  <p>The <code title="attr-img-ismap">ismap</code> attribute is a
  <span>boolean attribute</span>. The attribute must not be specified

  is being rendered, and is being rendered to a visual medium; or else
  the intrinsic width and height of the image, in CSS pixels, if the
  image is <i>available</i> but not being rendered to a visual medium;

   <p>A single image can have different appropriate alternative text

   <p>In each of the following cases, the same image is used, yet the

   time. The image is the coat of arms of the Canton Geneva in
   Switzerland.</p>

   <p>Here it is used as a supplementary icon:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>I lived in &lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt=""> Carouge.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is used as an icon representing the town:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>Home town: &lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt="Carouge">&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is used as part of a text on the town:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Carouge has a coat of arms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt="The coat of arms depicts a lion, sitting in front of a tree.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is used as decoration all over the town.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is used as a way to support a similar text where the
   description is given as well as, instead of as an alternative to,
   the image:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Carouge has a coat of arms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coat of arms depicts a lion, sitting in front of a tree.
It is used as decoration all over the town.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is used as part of a story:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>He picked up the folder and a piece of paper fell out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt="Shaped like a shield, the paper had a
red background, a green tree, and a yellow lion with its tongue
hanging out and whose tail was shaped like an S.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He stared at the folder. S! The answer he had been looking for all
this time was simply the letter S! How had he not seen that before? It all
came together now. The phone call where Hector had referred to a lion's tail,
the time Marco had stuck his tongue out...&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is not known at the time of publication what the image
   will be, only that it will be a coat of arms of some kind, and thus
   no replacement text can be provided, and instead only a brief
   caption for the image is provided, in the <code
   title="attr-title">title</code> attribute:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The last user to have uploaded a coat of arms uploaded this one:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="last-uploaded-coat-of-arms.cgi" title="User-uploaded coat of arms.">&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Ideally, the author would find a way to provide real replacement
   text even in this case, e.g. by asking the previous user. Not
   providing replacement text makes the document more difficult to use
   for people who are unable to view images, e.g. blind users, or
   users or very low-bandwidth connections or who pay by the byte, or
   users who are forced to use a text-only Web browser.</p>

  <h5 id="alt">Requirements for providing text to act as an alternative for images</h5>

  <p>The requirements for the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute depend on what the image is intended to represent, as
  described in the following sections.</p>


  <h6>A link or button containing nothing but the image</h6>

  <p>When an <span>a</span> element that is a <span>hyperlink</span>,
  or a <code>button</code> element, has no textual content but
  contains one or more images, the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attributes must contain text that
  together convey the purpose of the link or button.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, a user is asked to pick his preferred color
   from a list of three. Each color is given by an image, but for
   users who have configured their user agent not to display images,
   the color names are used instead:</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1>Pick your color&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="green.html"><strong>&lt;img src="green.jpeg" alt="Green"></strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="blue.html"><strong>&lt;img src="blue.jpeg" alt="Blue"></strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="red.html"><strong>&lt;img src="red.jpeg" alt="Red"></strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, each button has a set of images to indicate the
   kind of color output desired by the user. The first image is used
   in each case to give the alternative text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;button name="rgb"><strong>&lt;img src="red" alt="RGB">&lt;img src="green" alt="">&lt;img src="blue" alt=""></strong>&lt;/button>
&lt;button name="cmyk"><strong>&lt;img src="cyan" alt="CMYK">&lt;img src="magenta" alt="">&lt;img src="yellow" alt="">&lt;img src="black" alt=""></strong>&lt;/button></pre>

   <p>Since each image represents one part of the text, it could also
   be written like this:</p>

   <pre>&lt;button name="rgb"><strong>&lt;img src="red" alt="R">&lt;img src="green" alt="G">&lt;img src="blue" alt="B"></strong>&lt;/button>
&lt;button name="cmyk"><strong>&lt;img src="cyan" alt="C">&lt;img src="magenta" alt="M">&lt;img src="yellow" alt="Y">&lt;img src="black" alt="K"></strong>&lt;/button></pre>

   <p>However, with other alternative text, this might not work, and
   putting all the alternative text into one image in each case might
   make more sense:</p>

   <pre>&lt;button name="rgb"><strong>&lt;img src="red" alt="sRGB profile">&lt;img src="green" alt="">&lt;img src="blue" alt=""></strong>&lt;/button>
&lt;button name="cmyk"><strong>&lt;img src="cyan" alt="CMYK profile">&lt;img src="magenta" alt="">&lt;img src="yellow" alt="">&lt;img src="black" alt=""></strong>&lt;/button></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A phrase or paragraph with an alternative graphical representation: charts, diagrams, graphs, maps, illustrations</h6>

  <p>Sometimes something can be more clearly stated in graphical
  form, for example as a flowchart, a diagram, a graph, or a simple
  map showing directions. In such cases, an image can be given using
  the <code>img</code> element, but the lesser textual version must
  still be given, so that users who are unable to view the image
  (e.g. because they have a very slow connection, or because they
  are using a text-only browser, or because they are listening to
  the page being read out by a hands-free automobile voice Web
  browser, or simply because they are blind) are still able to
  understand the message being conveyed.</p>

  <p>The text must be given in the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute, and must convey the
  same message as the image specified in the <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>It is important to realize that the alternative text is a
  <em>replacement</em> for the image, not a description of the
  image.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example we have <a
   href="images/parsing-model-overview.png">a flowchart</a> in image
   form, with text in the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
   attribute rephrasing the flowchart in prose form:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>In the common case, the data handled by the tokenization stage
comes from the network, but it can also come from script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt="The network
passes data to the Tokeniser stage, which passes data to the Tree
Construction stage. From there, data goes to both the DOM and to
Script Execution. Script Execution is linked to the DOM, and, using
document.write(), passes data to the Tokeniser."></strong>&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here's another example, showing a good solution and a bad
   solution to the problem of including an image in a
   description.</p>

   <p>First, here's the good solution. This sample shows how the
   alternative text should just be what you would have put in the
   prose if the image had never existed.</p>

   <pre>&lt;!-- This is the correct way to do things. -->
&lt;p>
 You are standing in an open field west of a house.
 <strong>&lt;img src="house.jpeg" alt="The house is white, with a boarded front door."></strong>
 There is a small mailbox here.
&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Second, here's the bad solution. In this incorrect way of
   doing things, the alternative text is simply a description of the
   image, instead of a textual replacement for the image. It's bad
   because when the image isn't shown, the text doesn't flow as well
   as in the first example.</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- <em>This is the wrong way to do things.</em> -->
&lt;p>
 You are standing in an open field west of a house.
 &lt;img src="house.jpeg" alt="A white house, with a boarded front door.">
 There is a small mailbox here.
&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>


  <h6>A short phrase or label with an alternative graphical representation: icons, logos</h6>

  <p>A document can contain information in iconic form. The icon is
  intended to help users of visual browsers to recognize features at
  a glance.</p>

  <p>In some cases, the icon is supplemental to a text label
  conveying the same meaning. In those cases, the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be present but must
  be empty.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here the icons are next to text that conveys the same meaning,
   so they have an empty <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
   attribute:</p>

   <pre>&lt;nav>
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="/help/"><strong>&lt;img src="/icons/help.png" alt=""></strong> Help&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="/configure/"><strong>&lt;img src="/icons/configuration.png" alt=""></strong>
 Configuration Tools&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/nav></pre>

  </div>

  <p>In other cases, the icon has no text next to it describing what
  it means; the icon is supposed to be self-explanatory. In those
  cases, an equivalent textual label must be given in the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here, posts on a news site are labeled with an icon
   indicating their topic.</p>

   <pre>&lt;body>
 &lt;article>
  &lt;header>
   &lt;h1>Ratatouille wins &lt;i>Best Movie of the Year&lt;/i> award&lt;/h1>
   &lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="movies.png" alt="Movies"></strong>&lt;/p>
  &lt;/header>
  &lt;p>Pixar has won yet another &lt;i>Best Movie of the Year&lt;/i> award,
  making this its 8th win in the last 12 years.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/article>

  &lt;header>
   &lt;h1>Latest TWiT episode is online&lt;/h1>
   &lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="podcasts.png" alt="Podcasts"></strong>&lt;/p>
  &lt;/header>
  &lt;p>The latest TWiT episode has been posted, in which we hear
  several tech news stories as well as learning much more about the
  iPhone. This week, the panelists compare how reflective their
  iPhones' Apple logos are.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/article>
&lt;/body></pre>

  </div>

  <p>Many pages include logos, insignia, flags, or emblems, which
  stand for a particular entity such as a company, organization,
  project, band, software package, country, or some such.</p>

  <p>If the logo is being used to represent the entity, e.g. as a page
  header, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must
  contain the name of the entity being represented by the logo. The
  <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must <em>not</em>
  contain text like the word "logo", as it is not the fact that it is
  a logo that is being conveyed, it's the entity itself.</p>

  <p>If the logo is being used next to the name of the entity that
  it represents, then the logo is supplemental, and its <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must instead be
  empty.</p>

  <p>If the logo is merely used as decorative material (as branding,
  or, for example, as a side image in an article that mentions the
  entity to which the logo belongs), then the entry below on purely
  decorative images applies. If the logo is actually being
  discussed, then it is being used as a phrase or paragraph (the
  description of the logo) with an alternative graphical
  representation (the logo itself), and the first entry above
  applies.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following snippets, all four of the above cases are
   present. First, we see a logo used to represent a company:</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1><strong>&lt;img src="XYZ.gif" alt="The XYZ company"></strong>&lt;/h1></pre>

   <p>Next, we see a paragraph which uses a logo right next to the
   company name, and so doesn't have any alternative text:

   <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h2>News&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>We have recently been looking at buying the <strong>&lt;img src="alpha.gif"
 alt=""> &Alpha;&Beta;&Gamma; company</strong>, a small Greek company
 specializing in our type of product.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>In this third snippet, we have a logo being used in an aside,
   as part of the larger article discussing the acquisition:</p>

<pre> <strong>&lt;aside>&lt;p>&lt;img src="alpha-large.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>&lt;/aside></strong>
 &lt;p>The &Alpha;&Beta;&Gamma; company has had a good quarter, and our
 pie chart studies of their accounts suggest a much bigger blue slice
 than its green and orange slices, which is always a good sign.&lt;/p>
&lt;/article></pre>

   <p>Finally, we have an opinion piece talking about a logo, and
   the logo is therefore described in detail in the alternative
   text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Consider for a moment their logo:&lt;/p>

<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/images/logo" alt="It consists of a green circle with a
green question mark centered inside it.">&lt;/p></strong>

&lt;p>How unoriginal can you get? I mean, oooooh, a question mark, how
&lt;em>revolutionary&lt;/em>, how utterly &lt;em>ground-breaking&lt;/em>, I'm
sure everyone will rush to adopt those specifications now! They could
at least have tried for some sort of, I don't know, sequence of
rounded squares with varying shades of green and bold white outlines,
at least that would look good on the cover of a blue book.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>This example shows how the alternative text should be written
   such that if the image isn't <i>available</i>, and the text is used
   instead, the text flows seamlessly into the surrounding text, as
   if the image had never been there in the first place.</p>

  </div>


  <h6>Text that has been rendered to a graphic for typographical effect</h6>

  <p>Sometimes, an image just consists of text, and the purpose of the
  image is not to highlight the actual typographic effects used to
  render the text, but just to convey the text itself.</p>

  <p>In such cases, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute must be present but must consist of the same text as
  written in the image itself.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Consider a graphic containing the text "Earth Day", but with the
   letters all decorated with flowers and plants. If the text is
   merely being used as a header, to spice up the page for graphical
   users, then the correct alternative text is just the same text
   "Earth Day", and no mention need be made of the decorations:</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1><strong>&lt;img src="earthdayheader.png" alt="Earth Day"></strong>&lt;/h1></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A graphical representation of some of the surrounding text</h6>

  <p>In many cases, the image is actually just supplementary, and
  its presence merely reinforces the surrounding text. In these
  cases, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be
  present but its value must be the empty string.</p>

  <p>In general, an image falls into this category if removing the
  image doesn't make the page any less useful, but including the
  image makes it a lot easier for users of visual browsers to
  understand the concept.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>A flowchart that repeats the previous paragraph in graphical form:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The network passes data to the Tokeniser stage, which
passes data to the Tree Construction stage. From there, data goes
to both the DOM and to Script Execution. Script Execution is
linked to the DOM, and, using document.write(), passes data to
the Tokeniser.&lt;/p>
<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt="">&lt;/p></strong></pre>

   <p>In these cases, it would be wrong to include alternative text
   that consists of just a caption. If a caption is to be included,
   then either the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute can
   be used, or the <code>figure</code> and <code>legend</code>
   elements can be used. In the latter case, the image would in fact
   be a phrase or paragraph with an alternative graphical
   representation, and would thus require alternative text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;!-- Using the title="" attribute -->
&lt;p>The network passes data to the Tokeniser stage, which
passes data to the Tree Construction stage. From there, data goes
to both the DOM and to Script Execution. Script Execution is

&lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt=""
        title="Flowchart representation of the parsing model."></strong>&lt;/p></pre>

&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt="The Network leads

 from which Tree Construction leads is the DOM. The DOM is related to
 the Script Execution."></strong>
 &lt;legend>Flowchart representation of the parsing model.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- This is WRONG. Do not do this. Instead, do what the above examples do. -->

<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="rendering-mode-pie-chart.png" alt="">&lt;/p></strong></pre>

  <h6>A purely decorative image that doesn't add any information</h6>

  <p>In general, if an image is decorative but isn't especially
  page-specific, for example an image that forms part of a site-wide
  design scheme, the image should be specified in the site's CSS,
  not in the markup of the document.</p>

  <p>However, a decorative image that isn't discussed by the
  surrounding text still has some relevance can be included in a page
  using the <code>img</code> element. Such images are decorative, but
  still form part of the content. In these cases, the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be present but its
  value must be the empty string.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Examples where the image is purely decorative despite being
   relevant would include things like a photo of the Black Rock City
   landscape in a blog post about an event at Burning Man, or an
   image of a painting inspired by a poem, on a page reciting that
   poem. The following snippet shows an example of the latter
   case (only the first verse is included in this snippet):</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1>The Lady of Shalott&lt;/h1>
<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="shalott.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p></strong>
&lt;p>On either side the river lie&lt;br>
Long fields of barley and of rye,&lt;br>
That clothe the wold and meet the sky;&lt;br>
And through the field the road run by&lt;br>
To many-tower'd Camelot;&lt;br>
And up and down the people go,&lt;br>
Gazing where the lilies blow&lt;br>
Round an island there below,&lt;br>
The island of Shalott.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A group of images that form a single larger picture with no links</h6>

  <p>When a picture has been sliced into smaller image files that are
  then displayed together to form the complete picture again, one of
  the images must have its <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute set as per the relevant rules that would be appropriate
  for the picture as a whole, and then all the remaining images must
  have their <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute set to
  the empty string.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a picture representing a company logo
   for <span title="">XYZ Corp</span> has been split into two pieces,
   the first containing the letters "XYZ" and the second with the word
   "Corp". The alternative text ("XYZ Corp") is all in the first
   image.</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1><strong>&lt;img src="logo1.png" alt="XYZ Corp">&lt;img src="logo2.png" alt=""></strong>&lt;/h1></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a rating is shown as three filled
   stars and two empty stars. While the alternative text could have
   been "&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2606;", the author has
   instead decided to more helpfully give the rating in the form "3
   out of 5". That is the alternative text of the first image, and the
   rest have blank alternative text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Rating: &lt;meter max=5 value=3><strong>&lt;img src="1" alt="3 out of 5"
  >&lt;img src="1" alt="">&lt;img src="1" alt="">&lt;img src="0" alt=""
  >&lt;img src="0" alt=""></strong>&lt;/meter>&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A group of images that form a single larger picture with links</h6>

  <p>Generally, <span title="image map">image maps</span> should be
  used instead of slicing an image for links.</p>

  <p>However, if an image is indeed sliced and any of the components
  of the sliced picture are the sole contents of links, then one image
  per link must have alternative text in its <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute representing the purpose
  of the link.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a picture representing the flying
   spaghetti monster emblem, with each of the left noodly appendages
   and the right noodly appendages in different images, so that the
   user can pick the left side or the right side in an adventure.</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1>The Church&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You come across a flying spaghetti monster. Which side of His
Noodliness do you wish to reach out for?&lt;/p>
<strong>&lt;p>&lt;a href="?go=left" >&lt;img src="fsm-left.png"  alt="Left side. ">&lt;/a
  >&lt;img src="fsm-middle.png" alt=""
  >&lt;a href="?go=right">&lt;img src="fsm-right.png" alt="Right side.">&lt;/a>&lt;/p></strong></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A key part of the content</h6>

  <p>In some cases, the image is a critical part of the
  content. This could be the case, for instance, on a page that is
  part of a photo gallery. The image is the whole <em>point</em> of
  the page containing it.</p>

  <p>How to provide alternative text for an image that is a key part
  of the content depends on the image's provenance.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>The general case</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When it is possible for detailed alternative text to be
    provided, for example if the image is part of a series of
    screenshots in a magazine review, or part of a comic strip, or is
    a photograph in a blog entry about that photograph, text that can
    serve as a substitute for the image must be given as the contents
    of the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A screenshot in a gallery of screenshots for a new OS, with
     some alternative text:</p>

     <pre>&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="KDE%20Light%20desktop.png"
      alt="The desktop is blue, with icons along the left hand side in
           two columns, reading System, Home, K-Mail, etc. A window is
           open showing that menus wrap to a second line if they
           cannot fit in the window. The window has a list of icons
           along the top, with an address bar below it, a list of
           icons for tabs along the left edge, a status bar on the
           bottom, and two panes in the middle. The desktop has a bar
           at the bottom of the screen with a few buttons, a pager, a
           list of open applications, and a clock."></strong>
 &lt;legend>Screenshot of a KDE desktop.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A graph in a financial report:</p>

     <pre><strong>&lt;img src="sales.gif"
     title="Sales graph"
     alt="From 1998 to 2005, sales increased by the following percentages
     with each year: 624%, 75%, 138%, 40%, 35%, 9%, 21%"></strong></pre>

     <p>Note that "sales graph" would be inadequate alternative text
     for a sales graph. Text that would be a good <em>caption</em> is
     not generally suitable as replacement text.</p>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Images that defy a complete description</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>In certain cases, the nature of the image might be such that
    providing thorough alternative text is impractical. For example,
    the image could be indistinct, or could be a complex fractal, or
    could be a detailed topographical map.</p>

    <p>In these cases, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
    attribute must contain some suitable alternative text, but it may
    be somewhat brief.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Sometimes there simply is no text that can do justice to an
     image. For example, there is little that can be said to usefully
     describe a Rorschach inkblot test. However, a description, even
     if brief, is still better than nothing:</p>

     <pre>&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="/commons/a/a7/Rorschach1.jpg" alt="A shape with left-right
 symmetry with indistinct edges, with a small gap in the center, two
 larger gaps offset slightly from the center, with two similar gaps
 under them. The outline is wider in the top half than the bottom
 half, with the sides extending upwards higher than the center, and
 the center extending below the sides."></strong>
 &lt;legend>A black outline of the first of the ten cards
 in the Rorschach inkblot test.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

     <p>Note that the following would be a very bad use of alternative
     text:</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- This example is wrong. Do not copy it. -->
&lt;figure>
 &lt;img src="/commons/a/a7/Rorschach1.jpg" alt="A black outline
 of the first of the ten cards in the Rorschach inkblot test.">
 &lt;legend>A black outline of the first of the ten cards
 in the Rorschach inkblot test.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

     <p>Including the caption in the alternative text like this isn't
     useful because it effectively duplicates the caption for users
     who don't have images, taunting them twice yet not helping them
     any more than if they had only read or heard the caption
     once.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Another example of an image that defies full description is a
     fractal, which, by definition, is infinite in complexity.</p>

     <p>The following example shows one possible way of providing
     alternative text for the full view of an image of the Mandelbrot
     set.</p>

     <pre><strong>&lt;img src="ms1.jpeg" alt="The Mandelbrot set appears as a cardioid with
its cusp on the real axis in the positive direction, with a smaller
bulb aligned along the same center line, touching it in the negative
direction, and with these two shapes being surrounded by smaller bulbs
of various sizes."></strong></pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Images whose contents are not known</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>In some unfortunate cases, there might be no alternative text
    available at all, either because the image is obtained in some
    automated fashion without any associated alternative text (e.g. a
    Webcam), or because the page is being generated by a script using
    user-provided images where the user did not provide suitable or
    usable alternative text (e.g. photograph sharing sites), or
    because the author does not himself know what the images represent
    (e.g. a blind photographer sharing an image on his blog).</p>

    <p>In such cases, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
    attribute's value may be omitted, but one of the following
    conditions must be met as well:</p>

    <ul>

     <li>The <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute is
     present and has a non-empty value.</li>

     <li>The <code>img</code> element is in a <code>figure</code>
     element that contains a <code>legend</code> element that contains
     content other than <span>inter-element whitespace</span>.</li>

     <li>The <code>img</code> element is part of the only
     <span>paragraph</span> directly in its <span
     title="concept-section">section</span>, and is the only
     <code>img</code> element without an <code
     title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute in its section, and its
     <span title="concept-section">section</span> has an associated
     heading.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="note">Such cases are to be kept to an absolute
    minimum. If there is even the slightest possibility of the author
    having the ability to provide real alternative text, then it would
    not be acceptable to omit the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
    attribute.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A photo on a photo-sharing site, if the site received the
     image with no metadata other than the caption:</p>

     <pre>&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="1100670787_6a7c664aef.jpg"></strong>
 &lt;legend>Bubbles traveled everywhere with us.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

     <p>It could also be marked up like this:</p>

     <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h1>Bubbles traveled everywhere with us.&lt;/h1>
 <strong>&lt;img src="1100670787_6a7c664aef.jpg"></strong>
&lt;/article></pre>

     <p>In either case, though, it would be better if a detailed
     description of the important parts of the image obtained from the
     user and included on the page.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A blind user's blog in which a photo taken by the user is
     shown. Initially, the user might not have any idea what the photo
     he took shows:</p>

     <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h1>I took a photo&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>I went out today and took a photo!&lt;/p>
 &lt;figure>
  <strong>&lt;img src="photo2.jpeg"></strong>
  &lt;legend>A photograph taken blindly from my front porch.&lt;/legend>
 &lt;/figure>
&lt;/article></pre>

     <p>Eventually though, the user might obtain a description of the
     image from his friends and could then include alternative text:</p>

     <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h1>I took a photo&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>I went out today and took a photo!&lt;/p>
 &lt;figure>
  <strong>&lt;img src="photo2.jpeg" alt="The photograph shows my hummingbird
  feeder hanging from the edge of my roof. It is half full, but there
  are no birds around. In the background, out-of-focus trees fill the
  shot. The feeder is made of wood with a metal grate, and it contains
  peanuts. The edge of the roof is wooden too, and is painted white
  with light blue streaks."></strong>
  &lt;legend>A photograph taken blindly from my front porch.&lt;/legend>
 &lt;/figure>
&lt;/article></pre>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Sometimes the entire point of the image is that a textual
     description is not available, and the user is to provide the
     description. For instance, the point of a CAPTCHA image is to see
     if the user can literally read the graphic. Here is one way to
     mark up a CAPTCHA (note the <code title="attr-title">title</code>
     attribute):</p>

     <pre>&lt;p>&lt;label>What does this image say?
<strong>&lt;img src="captcha.cgi?id=8934" title="CAPTCHA"></strong>
&lt;input type=text name=captcha>&lt;/label>
(If you cannot see the image, you can use an &lt;a
href="?audio">audio&lt;/a> test instead.)&lt;/p></pre>

     <p>Another example would be software that displays images and
     asks for alternative text precisely for the purpose of then
     writing a page with correct alternative text. Such a page could
     have a table of images, like this:</p>

     <pre>&lt;table>
 &lt;thead>
  &lt;tr> &lt;th> Image &lt;th> Description
 &lt;tbody>
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;td> <strong>&lt;img src="2421.png" title="Image 640 by 100, filename 'banner.gif'"></strong>
   &lt;td> &lt;input name="alt2421">
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;td> <strong>&lt;img src="2422.png" title="Image 200 by 480, filename 'ad3.gif'"></strong>
   &lt;td> &lt;input name="alt2422">
&lt;/table></pre>

     <p>Notice that even in this example, as much useful information
     as possible is still included in the <code
     title="attr-title">title</code> attribute.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="note">Since some users cannot use images at all
    (e.g. because they have a very slow connection, or because they
    are using a text-only browser, or because they are listening to
    the page being read out by a hands-free automobile voice Web
    browser, or simply because they are blind), the <code
    title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute is only allowed to be
    omitted rather than being provided with replacement text when no
    alternative text is available and none can be made available, as
    in the above examples. Lack of effort from the part of the author
    is not an acceptable reason for omitting the <code
    title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>



  <h6>An image not intended for the user</h6>

  <p>Generally authors should avoid using <code>img</code> elements
  for purposes other than showing images.</p>

  <p>If an <code>img</code> element is being used for purposes other
  than showing an image, e.g. as part of a service to count page
  views, then the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must
  be the empty string.</p>



  <h6>An image in an e-mail or document intended for a specific person who is known to be able to view images</h6>

  <p>When an image is included in a communication (such as an HTML
  e-mail) aimed at someone who is known to be able to view images,
  the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute may be
  omitted. However, even in such cases it is strongly recommended
  that alternative text be included (as appropriate according to the
  kind of image involved, as described in the above entries), so
  that the e-mail is still usable should the user use a mail client
  that does not support images, or should the e-mail be forwarded on
  to other users whose abilities might not include easily seeing
  images.</p>



  <h6>General guidelines</h6>

  <p>The most general rule for writing alternative text is that the
  intent is that replacing every image with the text of its <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute not change the meaning of
  the page.</p>

  <p>So, in general, alternative text can be written by considering
  what one would have written had one not been able to include the
  image.</p>

  <p>A corollary to this is that the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute's value should never
  contain text that could be considered the image's <em>caption</em>,
  <em>title</em>, or <em>legend</em>. It is supposed to contain
  replacement text that could be used by users <em>instead</em> of the
  image; it is not meant to supplement the image. The <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute can be used for
  supplemental information.</p>

  <p class="note">One way to think of alternative text is to think
  about how you would read the page containing the image to someone
  over the phone, without mentioning that there is an image
  present. Whatever you say instead of the image is typically a good
  start for writing the alternative text.</p>



  <h6>Guidance for markup generators</h6>

  <p>Markup generators (such as WYSIWYG authoring tools) should,
  wherever possible, obtain alternative text from their
  users. However, it is recognised that in many cases, this will not
  be possible.</p>

  <p>For images that are the sole contents of links, markup generators
  should examine the link target to determine the title of the target,
  or the URL of the target, and use information obtained in this
  manner as the alternative text.</p>

  <p>As a last resort, implementors should either set the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute to the empty string, under
  the assumption that the image is a purely decorative image that
  doesn't add any information but is still specific to the surrounding
  content, or omit the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute
  altogther, under the assumption that the image is a key part of the
  content.</p>

  <p>Markup generators should generally avoid using the image's own
  file name as the alternative text.</p>

  <p>The <code>iframe</code> element <span>represents</span> a
  <span>nested browsing context</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-iframe-src"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute
  gives the address of a page that the <span>nested browsing
  context</span> is to contain. The attribute, if present, must be a
  <span>valid URL</span>. When the browsing context is created, if the
  attribute is present, the user agent must <span title="resolve a
  url">resolve</span> the value of that attribute, relative to the
  element, and if that is successful, must then <span>navigate</span>
  the element's browsing context to the resulting <span>absolute
  URL</span>, with <span>replacement enabled</span>, and with the
  <code>iframe</code> element's document's <span>browsing
  context</span> as the <span>source browsing context</span>. If the
  user <span title="navigate">navigates</span> away from this page,
  the <code>iframe</code>'s corresponding <code>WindowProxy</code>
  object will proxy new <code>Window</code> objects for new
  <code>Document</code> objects, but the <code

  <p>Whenever the <code title="attr-iframe-src">src</code> attribute
  is set, the user agent must <span title="resolve a

  <code>iframe</code> element's document's <span>browsing
  context</span> as the <span>source browsing context</span>.</p> <!--
  It doesn't happen when the base URL is changed, though. -->

  <p>If the <code title="attr-iframe-src">src</code> attribute is not
  set when the element is created, or if its value cannot be <span
  title="resolve a url">resolved</span>, the browsing context will
  remain at the initial <code>about:blank</code> page.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-iframe-name"><code>name</code></dfn>
  attribute, if present, must be a <span>valid browsing context
  name</span>. When the browsing context is created, if the attribute
  is present, the <span>browsing context name</span> must be set to
  the value of this attribute; otherwise, the <span>browsing context
  name</span> must be set to the empty string.</p>

  <p>Whenever the <code title="attr-iframe-name">name</code> attribute
  is set, the nested <span>browsing context</span>'s <span
  title="browsing context name">name</span> must be changed to the new
  value. If the attribute is removed, the <span>browsing context
  name</span> must be set to the empty string.</p>

  <p>When content loads in an <code>iframe</code>, after any <code
  title="event-load">load</code> events are fired within the content
  itself, the user agent must <span>fire a <code
  title="event-load">load</code> event</span> at the
  <code>iframe</code> element. When content fails to load (e.g. due to
  a network error), then the user agent must <span>fire an <code

  instead.</p>

  when anything in the <code>iframe</code> that is <span title="delay

  <p class="note">If, during the handling of the <code

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-iframe-sandbox"><code>sandbox</code></dfn>

   it is affected by all the normal cross-site restrictions. In
   addition, the embedded page has scripting disabled, plugins
   disabled, forms disabled, and it cannot navigate any frames or
   windows other than itself (or any frames or windows it itself
   embeds).</p>

   <p>In this example, a gadget from another site is embedded. The

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-iframe-seamless"><code>seamless</code></dfn>
  attribute is a boolean attribute. When specified, it indicates that
  the <code>iframe</code> element's <span>browsing context</span> is
  to be rendered in a manner that makes it appear to be part of the
  containing document (seamlessly included in the parent
  document). Specifically, when the attribute is set on an element and
  while the <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>active
  document</span> has the <span>same origin</span> as the
  <code>iframe</code> element's document, or the <span>browsing
  context</span>'s <span>active document</span>'s <em><span title="the
  document's address">address</span><!-- XXX xref --></em> has the
  <span>same origin</span> as the <code>iframe</code> element's
  document, the following requirements apply:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><p>The user agent must set the <dfn>seamless browsing
   context flag</dfn> to true for that <span>browsing
   context</span>. This will <a href="#seamlessLinks">cause links to
   open in the parent browsing context</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>In a CSS-supporting user agent: the user agent must add all
   the style sheets that apply to the <code>iframe</code> element to
   the cascade of the <span>active document</span> of the
   <code>iframe</code> element's <span>nested browsing context</span>,
   at the appropriate cascade levels, before any style sheets
   specified by the document itself.</p></li>

   <li><p>In a CSS-supporting user agent: the user agent must, for the
   purpose of CSS property inheritance only, treat the root element of
   the <span>active document</span> of the <code>iframe</code>
   element's <span>nested browsing context</span> as being a child of
   the <code>iframe</code> element. (Thus inherited properties on the
   root element of the document in the <code>iframe</code> will
   inherit the computed values of those properties on the
   <code>iframe</code> element instead of taking their initial
   values.)</p></li>

   <li><p>In visual media, in a CSS-supporting user agent: the user agent
   should set the intrinsic width of the <code>iframe</code> to the
   width that the element would have if it was a non-replaced
   block-level element with 'width: auto'.</p></li>

   <li><p>In visual media, in a CSS-supporting user agent: the user agent
   should set the intrinsic height of the <code>iframe</code> to the
   height of the bounding box around the content rendered in the
   <code>iframe</code> at its current width.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>In visual media, in a CSS-supporting user agent: the user agent
    must force the height of the initial containing block of the
    <span>active document</span> of the <span>nested browsing
    context</span> of the <code>iframe</code> to zero.</p>

    <p class="note">This is intended to get around the otherwise
    circular dependency of percentage dimensions that depend on the
    height of the containing block, thus affecting the height of the
    document's bounding box, thus affecting the height of the
    viewport, thus affecting the size of the initial containing
    block.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>In speech media, the user agent should render the <span>nested
   browsing context</span> without announcing that it is a separate
   document.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>User agents should, in general, act as if the <span>active
    document</span> of the <code>iframe</code>'s <span>nested browsing
    context</span> was part of the document that the
    <code>iframe</code> is in.</p>

    <p class="example">For example if the user agent supports listing
    all the links in a document, links in "seamlessly" nested
    documents would be included in that list without being
    significantly distinguished from links in the document itself.</p>

   </li>

  </ul>

  <p class="XXX">Parts of the above might get moved into the
  rendering section at some point.</p>

  <p>If the attribute is not specified, or if the <span>origin</span>
  conditions listed above are not met, then the user agent should
  render the <span>nested browsing context</span> in a manner that is
  clearly distinguishable as a separate <span>browsing context</span>,
  and the <span>seamless browsing context flag</span> must be set to
  false for that <span>browsing context</span>.</p>

  <p class="warning">It is important that user agents recheck the
  above conditions whenever the <span>active document</span> of the
  <span>nested browsing context</span> of the <code>iframe</code>
  changes, such that the <span>seamless browsing context flag</span>
  gets unset if the <span>nested browsing context</span> is <span
  title="navigate">navigated</span> to another origin.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, the site's navigation is embedded using a

   legacy user agents, the site could also include a <code>base</code>
   element with a <code title="attr-base-target">target</code>
   attribute with the value <code title="">_parent</code>. Similarly,
   in new user agents the styles of the parent page will be
   automatically applied to the contents of the frame, but to support

   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>embed</code> element <span>represents</span> an
  integration point for an external (typically non-HTML) application
  or interactive content.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-embed-src"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute
  gives the address of the resource being embedded. The attribute, if
  present, must contain a <span>valid URL</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-embed-type"><code>type</code></dfn>
  attribute, if present, gives the MIME type of the plugin to
  instantiate.  The value must be a valid MIME type, optionally with
  parameters. If both the <code title="attr-embed-type">type</code>
  attribute and the <code title="attr-embed-src">src</code> attribute
  are present, then the <code title="attr-embed-type">type</code>
  attribute must specify the same type as the <span
  title="Content-Type">explicit Content-Type metadata</span> of the
  resource given by the <code title="attr-embed-src">src</code>
  attribute. <a href="#refsRFC2046">[RFC2046]</a></p>

  <p>When the element is created with neither a <code
  title="attr-embed-src">src</code> attribute nor a <code
  title="attr-embed-type">type</code> attribute, and when attributes
  are removed such that neither attribute is present on the element
  anymore, any plugins instantiated for the element must be removed,
  and the <code>embed</code> element represents nothing.</p>

  <p id="sandboxPluginEmbed">When the <span>sandboxed plugins browsing
  context flag</span> is set on the <span>browsing context</span> for
  which the <code>embed</code> element's document is the <span>active
  document</span>, then the user agent must render the
  <code>embed</code> element in a manner that conveys that the
  <span>plugin</span> was disabled. The user agent may offer the user
  the option to override the sandbox and instantiate the
  <span>plugin</span> anyway; if the user invokes such an option, the
  user agent must act as if the <span>sandboxed plugins browsing
  context flag</span> was not set for the purposes of this
  element.</p>

  <p class="warning">Plugins are disabled in sandboxed browsing
  contexts because they might not honor the restrictions imposed by
  the sandbox (e.g. they might allow scripting even when scripting in
  the sandbox is disabled). User agents should convey the danger of
  overriding the sandbox to the user if an option to do so is
  provided.</p>

  <p>When the element is created with a <code
  title="attr-embed-src">src</code> attribute, and whenever the <code
  title="attr-embed-src">src</code> attribute is subsequently set, and
  whenever the <code title="attr-embed-type">type</code> attribute is
  set or removed while the element has a <code
  title="attr-embed-src">src</code> attribute, if the element is not
  in a sandboxed browsing context, user agents must <span
  title="resolve a url">resolve</span> the value of the attribute,
  relative to the element, and if that is successful, should
  <span>fetch</span> the resulting <span>absolute URL</span>, find and
  instantiate an appropriate <span>plugin</span> based on the <span
  title="concept-embed-type">content's type</span>, and hand that
  <span>plugin</span> the content of the resource, replacing any
  previously instantiated plugin for the element. <!-- Note that this
  doesn't happen when the base URL changes. --></p>

  <p>Fetching the resource must <span>delay the <code
  title="event-load">load</code> event</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-embed-type">type of the content</dfn>
  being embedded is defined as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the element has a <code
   title="attr-embed-type">type</code> attribute, and that attribute's
   value is a type that a <span>plugin</span> supports, then the value
   of the <code title="attr-embed-type">type</code> attribute is the
   <span>content's type</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, if the <span title="url-path">&lt;path&gt;</span>
    component of the <span>URL</span> of the specified resource <!--
    XXX before or after redirects? --> matches a pattern that a
    <span>plugin</span> supports, then the <span>content's type</span>
    is the type that that plugin can handle.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, a plugin might say that it can
    handle resources with <span title="url-path">&lt;path&gt;</span>
    components that end with the four character string "<code
    title="">.swf</code>".</p>

    <p class="XXX">It would be better if browsers didn't do
    extension sniffing like this, and only based their decision on the
    actual contents of the resource. Couldn't we just apply the
    <span>sniffed type of a resource</span> steps?</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the specified resource has <span
   title="Content-Type">explicit Content-Type metadata</span>, then
   that is the <span>content's type</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, the content has no type and there can be no
   appropriate <span>plugin</span> for it.</p></li>

   <!-- This algorithm is a monument to bad design. Go legacy! -->

  </ol>

  <p>Whether the resource is fetched successfully or not (e.g. whether
  the response code was a 2xx code <span
  title="concept-http-equivalent-codes">or equivalent</span>) must be
  ignored when determining the resource's type and when handing the
  resource to the plugin.</p>

  <p class="note">This allows servers to return data for plugins even
  with error responses (e.g. HTTP 500 Internal Server Error codes can
  still contain plugin data).</p>

  <p>When the element is created with a <code
  title="attr-embed-type">type</code> attribute and no <code
  title="attr-embed-src">src</code> attribute, and whenever the <code
  title="attr-embed-type">type</code> attribute is subsequently set,
  so long as no <code title="attr-embed-src">src</code> attribute is
  set, and whenever the <code title="attr-embed-src">src</code>
  attribute is removed when the element has a <code
  title="attr-embed-type">type</code> attribute, if the element is not
  in a sandboxed browsing context, user agents should find and
  instantiate an appropriate <span>plugin</span> based on the value of
  the <code title="attr-embed-type">type</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>Any (namespace-less) attribute may be specified on the
  <code>embed</code> element, so long as its name is
  <span>XML-compatible</span> and contains no characters in the range
  U+0041 .. U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
  Z).</p>

  <p class="note">All attributes in <span>HTML documents</span> get
  lowercased automatically, so the restriction on uppercase letters
  doesn't affect such documents.</p>

  <p>The user agent should pass the names and values of all the
  attributes of the <code>embed</code> element that have no namespace
  to the <span>plugin</span> used, when it is instantiated.</p>

  <p>If the <span>plugin</span> instantiated for the
  <code>embed</code> element supports a scriptable interface, the
  <code>HTMLEmbedElement</code> object representing the element should
  expose that interface while the element is instantiated.</p>

  <p>The <code>embed</code> element has no <span>fallback
  content</span>. If the user agent can't find a suitable plugin, then
  the user agent must use a default plugin. (This default could be as
  simple as saying "Unsupported Format".)</p>

  <p>The <code>embed</code> element supports <span>dimension
  attributes</span>.</p>

  <p>The DOM attributes <dfn
  title="dom-embed-src"><code>src</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="dom-embed-type"><code>type</code></dfn> each must
  <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the same

  <p>A <code>video</code> element represents a video or movie.</p>

  <p>Content may be provided inside the <code>video</code>
  element. User agents should not show this content to the user; it is
  intended for older Web browsers which do not support
  <code>video</code>, so that legacy video plugins can be tried, or to
  show text to the users of these older browser informing them of how
  to access the video contents.</p>

  <p class="note">In particular, this content is not <i>fallback
  content</i> intended to address accessibility concerns. To make
  video content accessible to the blind, deaf, and those with other
  physical or cognitive disabilities, authors are expected to provide
  alternative media streams and/or to embed accessibility aids (such
  as caption or subtitle tracks) into their media streams.</p>

  <p>The <code>video</code> element is a <span>media element</span>
  whose <span>media data</span> is ostensibly video data, possibly
  with associated audio data.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-media-src">src</code>, <code
  title="attr-media-autoplay">autoplay</code>, <code
  title="attr-media-loop">loop</code>, and <code
  title="attr-media-controls">controls</code> attributes are <span
  title="media element attributes">the attributes common to all media
  elements</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-video-poster"><code>poster</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the address of an image file that the user agent can
  show while no video data is available. The attribute, if present,
  must contain a <span>valid URL</span>. If the specified resource is
  to be used, then, when the element is created or when the <code
  title="attr-video-poster">poster</code> attribute is set, its value
  must be <span title="resolve a url">resolved</span> relative to the
  element, and if that is successful, the resulting <span>absolute
  URL</span> must be <span title="fetch">fetched</span>. The
  <dfn>poster frame</dfn> is then the image obtained from that
  resource, if any.</p> <!-- thus it is unaffected by changes to the
  base URL. -->

  <p class="note">The image given by the <code
  title="attr-video-poster">poster</code> attribute, the <i>poster
  frame</i>, is intended to be a representative frame of the video
  (typically one of the first non-blank frames) that gives the user an
  idea of what the video is like.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-video-poster"><code>poster</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-video-poster">poster</code> content attribute.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When no video data is available (the element's <code
  title="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is either
  <code title="dom-media-HAVE_NOTHING">HAVE_NOTHING</code> or <code
  title="dom-media-HAVE_METADATA">HAVE_METADATA</code>), the
  <code>video</code> element <span>represents</span> either the
  <span>poster frame</span>, or nothing.</p>

  <p>When a <code>video</code> element is <span
  title="dom-media-paused">paused</span> and the <span title="current
  playback position">current playback position</span> is the first
  frame of video, the element <span>represents</span> either the frame
  of video corresponding to the <span title="current playback
  position">current playback position</span> or the <span>poster
  frame</span>, at the discretion of the user agent.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the above, the <span>poster frame</span> should
  be preferred over nothing, but the <span>poster frame</span> should
  not be shown again after a frame of video has been shown.</p>

  <p>When a <code>video</code> element is <span
  title="dom-media-paused">paused</span> at any other position, the
  element <span>represents</span> the frame of video corresponding to
  the <span title="current playback position">current playback
  position</span>, or, if that is not yet available (e.g. because the
  video is seeking or buffering), the last frame of the video to have
  been rendered.</p>

  <p>When a <code>video</code> element is <span>potentially
  playing</span>, it <span>represents</span> the frame of video at the
  continuously increasing <span title="current playback
  position">"current" position</span>. When the <span>current playback
  position</span> changes such that the last frame rendered is no
  longer the frame corresponding to the <span>current playback
  position</span> in the video, the new frame must be
  rendered. Similarly, any audio associated with the video must, if
  played, be played synchronized with the <span>current playback
  position</span>, at the specified <span
  title="dom-media-volume">volume</span> with the specified <span
  title="dom-media-muted">mute state</span>.</p>

  <p>When a <code>video</code> element is neither <span>potentially
  playing</span> nor <span title="dom-media-paused">paused</span>
  (e.g. when seeking or stalled), the element <span>represents</span>
  the last frame of the video to have been rendered.</p>

  <p class="note">Which frame in a video stream corresponds to a
  particular playback position is defined by the video stream's
  format.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, the user agent may provide messages to
  the user (such as "buffering", "no video loaded", "error", or more
  detailed information) by overlaying text or icons on the video or
  other areas of the element's playback area, or in another
  appropriate manner.</p>

  <p>User agents that cannot render the video may instead make the
  element <span title="represents">represent</span> a link to an
  external video playback utility or to the video data itself.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-video-intrinsic-width">intrinsic
  width</dfn> and <dfn
  title="concept-video-intrinsic-height">intrinsic height</dfn> of the
  <span>media resource</span> are the dimensions of the resource in
  CSS pixels after taking into account the resource's dimensions,
  aspect ratio, clean aperture, resolution, and so forth, as defined
  for the format used by the resource.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-video-videoWidth"><code>videoWidth</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return the <span
  title="concept-video-intrinsic-width">intrinsic width</span> of the
  video in CSS pixels. The <dfn
  title="dom-video-videoHeight"><code>videoHeight</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return the <span
  title="concept-video-intrinsic-height">intrinsic height</span> of
  the video in CSS pixels. If the element's <code
  title="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is <code
  title="dom-media-HAVE_NOTHING">HAVE_NOTHING</code>, then the
  attributes must return 0.</p>

  <p>The <code>video</code> element supports <span>dimension
  attributes</span>.</p>

  <p>Video content should be rendered inside the element's playback
  area such that the video content is shown centered in the playback
  area at the largest possible size that fits completely within it,
  with the video content's aspect ratio being preserved. Thus, if the
  aspect ratio of the playback area does not match the aspect ratio of
  the video, the video will be shown letterboxed or pillarboxed. Areas
  of the element's playback area that do not contain the video
  represent nothing.</p>

  <p>The intrinsic width of a <code>video</code> element's playback
  area is the <span title="concept-video-intrinsic-width">intrinsic
  width</span> of the video resource, if that is available; otherwise
  it is the intrinsic width of the <span>poster frame</span>, if that
  is available; otherwise it is 300 CSS pixels.</p>

  <p>The intrinsic height of a <code>video</code> element's playback
  area is the <span title="concept-video-intrinsic-height">intrinsic
  height</span> of the video resource, if that is available; otherwise
  it is the intrinsic height of the <span>poster frame</span>, if that
  is available; otherwise it is 150 CSS pixels.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- XXX
   default activation behavior is to do the play() if paused, pause()
   otherwise
  -->

  <p>User agents should provide controls to enable or disable the
  display of closed captions associated with the video stream, though
  such features should, again, not interfere with the page's normal
  rendering.</p>

  <p>User agents may allow users to view the video content in manners
  more suitable to the user (e.g. full-screen or in an independent
  resizable window). As for the other user interface features,
  controls to enable this should not interfere with the page's normal
  rendering unless the user agent is <span title="expose a user
  interface to the user">exposing a user interface</span>. In such an
  independent context, however, user agents may make full user
  interfaces visible, with, e.g., play, pause, seeking, and volume
  controls, even if the <code
  title="attr-media-controls">controls</code> attribute is absent.</p>

  <p>User agents may allow video playback to affect system features
  that could interfere with the user's experience; for example, user
  agents could disable screensavers while video playback is in
  progress.</p>

  <!-- XXX rendering section should mention that resizing a video
  should in no way interrupt playback -->

  <p class="warning">User agents should not provide a public API to
  cause videos to be shown full-screen. A script, combined with a
  carefully crafted video file, could trick the user into thinking a
  system-modal dialog had been shown, and prompt the user for a
  password. There is also the danger of "mere" annoyance, with pages
  launching full-screen videos when links are clicked or pages
  navigated. Instead, user-agent specific interface features may be
  provided to easily allow the user to obtain a full-screen playback
  mode.</p>

  <p class="XXX">The spec does not currently define the
  interaction of the "controls" attribute with the "height" and
  "width" attributes. This will likely be defined in the rendering
  section based on implementation experience. So far, browsers seem to
  be making the controls overlay-only, thus somewhat sidestepping the
  issue.</p>



  <h5>Video and audio codecs for <code>video</code> elements</h5>

  <p>User agents may support any video and audio codecs and container
  formats.</p>

  <p class="XXX">It would be helpful for interoperability if all
  browsers could support the same codecs. However, there are no known
  codecs that satisfy all the current players: we need a codec that is
  known to not require per-unit or per-distributor licensing, that is
  compatible with the open source development model, that is of
  sufficient quality as to be usable, and that is not an additional
  submarine patent risk for large companies. This is an ongoing issue
  and this section will be updated once more information is
  available.</p>

  <!-- XXX mention that this spec doesn't require native support or
  plugin support, either is fine -->

  <p class="note">Certain user agents might support no codecs at all,
  e.g. text browsers running over SSH connections.</p>

  <p><span title="media element">Media elements</span> are used to
  present audio data, or video and audio data, to the user. This is
  referred to as <dfn>media data</dfn> in this section, since this
  section applies equally to <span title="media element">media
  elements</span> for audio or for video. The term <dfn>media
  resource</dfn> is used to refer to the complete set of media data,
  e.g. the complete video file, or complete audio file.</p>

  <p><span title="media element">Media elements</span> use two <span
  title="task queue">task queues</span>, the <dfn>media element event
  task source</dfn> for asynchronous events and callbacks, and the
  <dfn>media element new resource task source</dfn> for handling
  implicit loads. Unless otherwise specified, the <span>task
  source</span> for all the tasks <span title="queue a
  task">queued</span> in this section and its subsections is the
  <span>media element event task source</span>.</p>


  <h5>Error codes</h5>

  <p>All <span title="media element">media elements</span> have an
  associated error status, which records the last error the element
  encountered since the <code title="dom-media-load">load()</code>
  method was last invoked. The <dfn
  title="dom-media-error"><code>error</code></dfn> attribute, on
  getting, must return the <code>MediaError</code> object created for
  this last error, or null if there has not been an error.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>MediaError</dfn> {
  const unsigned short <span title="dom-MediaError-MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED">MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED</span> = 1;
  const unsigned short <span title="dom-MediaError-MEDIA_ERR_NETWORK">MEDIA_ERR_NETWORK</span> = 2;
  const unsigned short <span title="dom-MediaError-MEDIA_ERR_DECODE">MEDIA_ERR_DECODE</span> = 3;
  const unsigned short <span title="dom-MediaError-MEDIA_ERR_NONE_SUPPORTED">MEDIA_ERR_NONE_SUPPORTED</span> = 4;
  readonly attribute unsigned short <span title="dom-MediaError-code">code</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-MediaError-code"><code>code</code></dfn>
  attribute of a <code>MediaError</code> object must return the code
  for the error, which must be one of the following:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-MediaError-MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED"><code>MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED</code></dfn> (numeric value 1)</dt>

   <dd>The fetching process for the <span>media resource</span> was
   aborted by the user agent at the user's request.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-MediaError-MEDIA_ERR_NETWORK"><code>MEDIA_ERR_NETWORK</code></dfn> (numeric value 2)</dt>

   <dd>A network error of some description caused the user agent to
   stop fetching the <span>media resource</span>, after the resource
   was established to be usable.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-MediaError-MEDIA_ERR_DECODE"><code>MEDIA_ERR_DECODE</code></dfn> (numeric value 3)</dt>

   <dd>An error of some description occurred while decoding the
   <span>media resource</span>, after the resource was established to
   be usable.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-MediaError-MEDIA_ERR_NONE_SUPPORTED"><code>MEDIA_ERR_NONE_SUPPORTED</code></dfn> (numeric value 4)</dt>

   <dd>No suitable <span>media resource</span> could be found.</dd>

  </dl>



  <h5>Location of the media resource</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-media-src"><code>src</code></dfn> content
  attribute on <span title="media element">media elements</span> gives
  the address of the media resource (video, audio) to show. The
  attribute, if present, must contain a <span>valid URL</span>.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-media-src">src</code> attribute of a
  <span>media element</span> that is already in a document and whose
  <code title="dom-media-networkState">networkState</code> is in the
  <code title="dom-media-NETWORK_EMPTY">NETWORK_EMPTY</code> state is
  added, changed, or removed, the user agent must <span>queue a
  task</span> that implicitly invokes the <code
  title="dom-media-load">load()</code> method on the <span>media
  element</span>, and ignores any resulting exceptions. The <span>task
  source</span> for this task is the <span>media element</span>'s own
  <span>media element new resource task source</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">If a <code title="attr-media-src">src</code>
  attribute is specified, the resource it specifies is the <span>media
  resource</span> that will be used. Otherwise, the resource specified
  by the first suitable <code>source</code> element child of the
  <span>media element</span> is the one used.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-src"><code>src</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute on <span title="media element">media elements</span> must
  <span>reflect</span> the respective content attribute of the same
  name.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-media-currentSrc"><code>currentSrc</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute is initially the empty string. Its value is changed by the
  algorithm for the <code title="dom-media-load">load()</code> method
  defined below.</p>

  <p>To <dfn>generate the list of potential media resources</dfn> for
  a <span>media element</span>, a user agent must use the following
  steps. These steps return a list of <span title="absolute
  URL">absolute URLs</span> giving a resource's address.</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the <span>media element</span> has a <code
    title="attr-media-src">src</code> attribute, then run these
    substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p><span title="resolve a url">Resolve</span> the
     <span>URL</span> given in that attribute, relative to the
     <span>media element</span>.</p>

     <li><p>If that is successful, then return a list consisting of
     only one entry, the resulting <span>absolute URL</span> as the
     resource's address.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, return the empty list.</p></li>

     <li><p>Abort the algorithm.</p></li>

    </ol>

    <p>Otherwise, the <code>source</code> elements will be used.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the <span>media element</span> has no <code>source</code>
   element children, then return the empty the list and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">result</var> be an empty list.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">candidate</var> be the first
   <code>source</code> element child in the <span>media
   element</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Loop</i>: this is the start of the loop that looks at the
   <code>source</code> elements.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If all the following conditions are true:</p>

    <ul>

     <li>The <var title="">candidate</var> element has a <code
     title="attr-source-src">src</code> attribute.</li>

     <li><span title="resolve a url">Resolving</span> the
     <span>URL</span> given by the <var title="">candidate</var>
     element's <code title="attr-source-src">src</code> attribute
     relative to <var title="">candidate</var> does not fail.</li>

     <li>The <var title="">candidate</var> element either has no <code
     title="attr-source-type">type</code> attribute, or its <code
     title="attr-source-type">type</code> attribute's value, when
     parsed as a MIME type (including any codecs described by the
     <code title="">codec</code> parameter), does not represent
     <span>a type that the user agent knows it cannot
     render</span>.</li>

     <li>The <var title="">candidate</var> element either has no <code
     title="attr-source-media">media</code> attribute, or its <code
     title="attr-source-media">media</code> attribute's value, when
     processed according to the rules for <a href="#mq">media
     queries</a>, matches the current environment. <a
     href="#refsMQ">[MQ]</a></li>

    </ul>

    <p>...then append the <span>absolute URL</span> resulting from
    <span title="resolve a url">resolving</span> the <span>URL</span>
    given in that <var title="">candidate</var> element's <code
    title="attr-source-src">src</code> attribute relative to <var
    title="">candidate</var> to the <var title="">result</var>
    list.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">candidate</var> be the next
   <code>source</code> element child in the <span>media
   element</span>, or null if there are no more such
   children.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">candidate</var> is not null, return to the
   step labeled <i>loop</i>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return <var title="">result</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>



  <h5>Media types</h5>

  <p>A <span>media resource</span> can be described in terms of its
  <em>type</em>, specifically a MIME type, optionally with a <code
  title="">codecs</code> parameter. <a
  href="#refsRFC2046">[RFC2046]</a> <a
  href="#refsRFC4281">[RFC4281]</a>.</p>

  <p>Types are usually somewhat incomplete descriptions; for example
  "<code title="">video/mpeg</code>" doesn't say anything except what
  the container type is, and even a type like "<code
  title="">video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.42E01E,
  mp4a.40.2&quot;</code>" doesn't include information like the actual
  bitrate (only the maximum bitrate). Thus, given a type, a user agent
  can often only know whether it <em>might</em> be able to play
  media of that type (with varying levels of confidence), or whether
  it definitely <em>cannot</em> play media of that type.</p>

  <p><dfn>A type that the user agent knows it cannot render</dfn> is
  one that describes a resource that the user agent definitely does
  not support, for example because it doesn't recognise the container
  type, or it doesn't support the listed codecs.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-navigator-canPlayType"><code>canPlayType(<var
  title="">type</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the string
  "<code title="">no</code>" if <var title="">type</var> is <span>a
  type that the user agent knows it cannot render</span>; it must
  return "<code title="">probably</code>" if the user agent is
  confident that the type represents a <span>media resource</span>
  that it can render if used in with this <code>audio</code> or
  <code>video</code> element; and it must return "<code
  title="">maybe</code>" otherwise. Implementors are encouraged to
  return "<code title="">maybe</code>" unless the type can be
  confidently established as being supported or not. Generally, a user
  agent should never return "<code title="">probably</code>" if the
  type doesn't have a <code title="">codecs</code> parameter.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This script tests to see if the user agent supports a
   (fictional) new format to dynamically decide whether to use a
   <code>video</code> element or a plugin:</p>

   <pre>&lt;section id="video">
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="playing-cats.nfv">Download video&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/section>
&lt;script>
 var videoSection = document.getElementById('video');
 var videoElement = document.createElement('video');
 var support = videoElement.canPlayType('video/x-new-fictional-format;codecs="kittens,bunnies"');
 if (support != "probably" &amp;&amp; "New Fictional Video Plug-in" in navigator.plugins) {
   // not confident of browser support
   // but we have a plugin
   // so use plugin instead
   videoElement = document.createElement("embed");
 } else if (support == "no") {
   // no support from browser and no plugin
   // do nothing
   videoElement = null;
 }
 if (videoElement) {
   while (videoSection.hasChildNodes())
     videoSection.removeChild(videoSection.firstChild);
   videoElement.setAttribute("src", "playing-cats.nfv");
   videoSection.appendChild(videoElement);
 }
&lt;/script></pre>

  </div>

  <p class="note">To express the type of a <span>media resource</span>
  to allow the user agent to avoid downloading resources it can't
  render, authors can use the <code>source</code> element's <code
  title="attr-source-type">type</code> attribute.</p>


  <h5>Network states</h5>

  <p>As <span title="media element">media elements</span> interact
  with the network, their current network activity is represented by
  the <dfn
  title="dom-media-networkState"><code>networkState</code></dfn>
  attribute. On getting, it must return the current network state of
  the element, which must be one of the following values:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-media-NETWORK_EMPTY"><code>NETWORK_EMPTY</code></dfn> (numeric value 0)</dt>

   <dd>The element has not yet been initialized. All attributes are in
   their initial states.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-media-NETWORK_IDLE"><code>NETWORK_IDLE</code></dfn> (numeric value 1)</dt>

   <dd>The element's <code title="dom-media-load">load()</code> method
   algorithm is active, but it is not actually using the network at
   this time.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-media-NETWORK_LOADING"><code>NETWORK_LOADING</code></dfn> (numeric value 2)</dt>

   <dd>The user agent is actively trying to download data.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-media-NETWORK_LOADED"><code>NETWORK_LOADED</code></dfn> (numeric value 3)</dt>

   <dd>The entire <span>media resource</span> has been obtained and is
   available to the user agent locally. Network connectivity could be
   lost without affecting the media playback.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>The algorithm for the <code title="dom-media-load">load()</code>
  method defined below describes exactly when the <code
  title="dom-media-networkState">networkState</code> attribute changes
  value and what events fire to indicate changes in this state.</p>

  <p class="note">Some resources, e.g. streaming Web radio, can never
  reach the <code
  title="dom-media-NETWORK_LOADED">NETWORK_LOADED</code> state.</p>


  <h5>Loading the media resource</h5>

  <p>All <span title="media element">media elements</span> have a
  <dfn>begun flag</dfn>, which must begin in the false state, and an
  <dfn>autoplaying flag</dfn>, which must begin in the true state.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn title="dom-media-load"><code>load()</code></dfn>
  method on a <span>media element</span> is invoked, the user agent
  must run the following steps. Note that this algorithm might get
  aborted, e.g. if the <code title="dom-media-load">load()</code>
  method itself is invoked again.</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If there are any <span title="concept-task">tasks</span> from
    the <span>media element</span>'s <span>media element new resource
    task source</span> or its <span>media element event task
    source</span> in one of the <span title="task queue">task
    queues</span>, then remove those tasks.</p>

    <p class="note">Basically, pending events, callbacks, and loads
    for the media element are discarded when the media element starts
    loading a new resource.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Abort any already-running instance of this algorithm for
   this element. If those method calls have not yet returned, they
   must finish the step they are on, and then immediately return. This
   is not blocking; this algorithm must not wait for the earlier
   instances to abort before continuing.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element's <span>begun flag</span> is true, then set
   the <span>begun flag</span> to false, set the <code
   title="dom-media-error">error</code> attribute to a new
   <code>MediaError</code> object whose <code
   title="dom-MediaError-code">code</code> attribute is set to <code
   title="dom-MediaError-MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED">MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED</code>,
   and <span>fire a progress event</span> called <code
   title="event-abort">abort</code> at the <span>media
   element</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <code title="dom-media-error">error</code> attribute
   to null and the <span>autoplaying flag</span> to true.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <code
   title="dom-media-playbackRate">playbackRate</code> attribute to the
   value of the <code
   title="dom-media-defaultPlaybackRate">defaultPlaybackRate</code>
   attribute.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>media element</span>'s <code

      <p>User agents may allow users to selectively block or slow
      <span>media data</span> downloads. When a <span>media
      element</span>'s download has been blocked altogether, the user
      agent must act as if it was stalled (as opposed to acting as if
      the connection was closed). The rate of the download may also be
      throttled automatically by the user agent, e.g. to balance the
      download with other connections sharing the same bandwidth.</p>

      <p>User agents may decide to not download more content at any
      time, e.g. after buffering five minutes of a one hour media
      resource, while waiting for the user to decide whether to play
      the resource or not, or while waiting for user input in an
      interactive resource. When a <span>media element</span>'s
      download has been suspended, the user agent must set the <code

      <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a progress event</span>

      title="dom-media-networkState">networkState</code> to <code
      title="dom-media-NETWORK_LOADING">NETWORK_LOADING</code>.</p>

      <p>The user agent may use whatever means necessary to fetch the
      resource (within the constraints put forward by this and other
      specifications); for example, reconnecting to the server in the
      face of network errors, using HTTP partial range requests, or
      switching to a streaming protocol. The user agent must consider a
      resource erroneous only if it has given up trying to fetch it.</p>

      <p>The <span>networking task source</span> <span
      title="concept-task">tasks</span> to process the data as it is
      being fetched must, when appropriate, include the relevant

  <code title="dom-media-NETWORK_EMPTY">NETWORK_EMPTY</code> is <span
  title="insert an element into a document">inserted into a
  document</span>, the user agent must <span>queue a task</span> that
  implicitly invokes the <code title="dom-media-load">load()</code>
  method on the <span>media element</span>, and ignores any resulting
  exceptions. The <span>task source</span> for this task is the
  <span>media element</span>'s own <span>media element new resource
  task source</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-media-bufferingRate"><code>bufferingRate</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the average number of bits received per second
  for the current download over the past few seconds. If there is no
  download in progress, the attribute must return 0.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-media-bufferingThrottled"><code>bufferingThrottled</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if the user agent is intentionally
  throttling the bandwidth used by the download (including when
  throttling to zero to pause the download altogether), and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-buffered"><code>buffered</code></dfn>
  attribute must return a new static <span>normalized
  <code>TimeRanges</code> object</span> that represents the ranges of
  the <span>media resource</span>, if any, that the user agent has
  buffered, at the time the attribute is evaluated. Users agents must
  accurately determine the ranges available, even for media streams
  where this can only be determined by tedious inspection.</p>

  <p class="note">Typically this will be a single range anchored at
  the zero point, but if, e.g. the user agent uses HTTP range requests
  in response to seeking, then there could be multiple ranges.</p>

  <p>User agents may discard previously buffered data.</p>

  <p class="note">Thus, a time position included within a range of the
  objects return by the <code
  title="dom-media-buffered">buffered</code> attribute at one time can
  end up being not included in the range(s) of objects returned by the
  same attribute at later times.</p>



  <h5>Offsets into the media resource</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-duration"><code>duration</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the length of the <span>media resource</span>,
  in seconds. If no <span>media data</span> is available, then the
  attributes must return the Not-a-Number (NaN) value. If the
  <span>media resource</span> is known to be unbounded (e.g. a
  streaming radio), then the attribute must return the positive
  Infinity value.</p>

  <p>The user agent must determine the duration of the <span>media
  resource</span> before playing any part of the <span>media
  data</span> and before setting <code
  title="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> to a value equal to
  or greater than <code
  title="dom-media-HAVE_METADATA">HAVE_METADATA</code>, even if doing
  so requires seeking to multiple parts of the resource.</p>

  <p id="durationChange">When the length of the <span>media
  resource</span> changes (e.g. from being unknown to known, or from a
  previously established length to a new length) the user agent must
  <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple event</span> called
  <code title="event-durationchange">durationchange</code> at the
  <span>media element</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">If an "infinite" stream ends for some reason,
  then the duration would change from positive Infinity to the time of
  the last frame or sample in the stream, and the <code
  title="event-durationchange">durationchange</code> event would be
  fired. Similarly, if the user agent initially estimated the
  <span>media resource</span>'s duration instead of determining it
  precisely, and later revises the estimate based on new information,
  then the duration would change and the <code
  title="event-durationchange">durationchange</code> event would be
  fired.</p>

  <p><span title="media element">Media elements</span> have a
  <dfn>current playback position</dfn>, which must initially be
  zero. The current position is a time.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-media-currentTime"><code>currentTime</code></dfn>
  attribute must, on getting, return the <span>current playback
  position</span>, expressed in seconds. On setting, the user agent
  must <span title="dom-media-seek">seek</span> to the new value
  (which might raise an exception).</p>

  <p>If the <span>media resource</span> is a streaming resource, then
  the user agent might be unable to obtain certain parts of the
  resource after it has expired from its buffer. The
  <dfn><var>earliest possible position</var></dfn> is the earliest
  position in the stream that the user agent can ever obtain
  again.</p>

  <p>When the <var>earliest possible position</var> changes, if the
  the <span>current playback position</span> is before the
  <var>earliest possible position</var>, the user agent must <span
  title="dom-media-seek">seek</span> to the <var>earliest possible
  position</var>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-media-loop"><code>loop</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span> that, if specified,
  indicates that the <span>media element</span> is to seek back to the
  start of the <span>media resource</span> upon reaching the end.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-loop"><code>loop</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the content attribute of the
  same name.</p>



  <h5>The ready states</h5>

  <p><span title="media element">Media elements</span> have a
  <i>ready state</i>, which describes to what degree they are ready
  to be rendered at the <span>current playback position</span>. The
  possible values are as follows; the ready state of a media element
  at any particular time is the greatest value describing the state of
  the element:</p>

  <h5>Playing the media resource</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-paused"><code>paused</code></dfn>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> is said to be <dfn>potentially

  <p>The <dfn

  attribute gives the speed at which the <span>media resource</span>
  plays, as a multiple of its intrinsic speed. If it is not equal to
  the <code

  then the implication is that the user is using a feature such as
  fast forward or slow motion playback. The attribute is mutable: on
  getting it must return the last value it was set to, or 1.0 if it
  hasn't yet been set; on setting the attribute must be set to the new
  value, and the playback must change speed (if the element is
  <span>potentially playing</span>).</p>

  <p>The "play" function in a user agent's interface must set the

  to the value of the <code
  title="dom-media-defaultPlaybackRate">defaultPlaybackRate</code>
  attribute before invoking the <code
  title="dom-media-play">play()</code> method's steps. Features such

  time per unit time of wall clock time.</p>

  <p class="note">This specification doesn't define how the user agent
  achieves the appropriate playback rate &mdash; depending on the

  could negotiate with the server to have the server provide the media

  playback rate) the client doesn't actually have to drop or

   <li><p>If the time was reached through the usual monotonic increase
   of the current playback position during normal playback, and if the
   user agent has not fired a <code
   title="event-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> event at the element in

   task</span> to <span>fire a simple event</span> called <code
   title="event-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> at the element. (In the
   other cases, such as explicit seeks, relevant events get fired as
   part of the overall process of changing the current playback
   position.)</p>

   <p class="note">The event thus is not to be fired faster than about
   66Hz or slower than 4Hz. User agents are encouraged to vary the

  <p class="note">If the <span>media element</span>'s
  <code>Document</code> stops being an active document, then the

  <h5>Seeking</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-seeking"><code>seeking</code></dfn>
  attribute must initially have the value false.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is required to <dfn
  title="dom-media-seek">seek</dfn> to a particular <var title="">new
  playback position</var> in the <span>media resource</span>, it means
  that the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <span>media element</span>'s <code
   title="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> is <code
   title="dom-media-HAVE_NOTHING">HAVE_NOTHING</code>, then the user
   agent must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception (if
   the seek was in response to a DOM method call or setting of a DOM
   attribute), and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var title="">new playback position</var> is later
   than the end of the <span>media resource</span>, then let it be the
   end of the <span>media resource</span> instead.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var title="">new playback position</var> is less
   than the <var>earliest possible position</var>, let it be that
   position instead.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the (possibly now changed) <var title="">new playback
   position</var> is not in one of the ranges given in the <code
   title="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code> attribute, then the user
   agent must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception (if the
   seek was in response to a DOM method call or setting of a DOM
   attribute), and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <span>current playback position</span> must be set to
   the given <var title="">new playback position</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <code title="dom-media-seeking">seeking</code> DOM
   attribute must be set to true.</p></li>

   <li id="seekUpdate"><p>The user agent must <span>queue a
   task</span> to <span>fire a simple event</span> called <code
   title="event-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> at the element.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>media element</span> was <span>potentially
   playing</span> immediately before it started seeking, but seeking
   caused its <code title="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code>
   attribute to change to a value lower than <code
   title="dom-media-HAVE_FUTURE_DATA">HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code>, the
   user agent must <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple
   event</span> called <code title="event-waiting">waiting</code> at
   the element.</p></li>

   <li><p>If, when it reaches this step, the user agent has still not
   established whether or not the <span>media data</span> for the <var
   title="">new playback position</var> is available, and, if it is,
   decoded enough data to play back that position, the user agent must
   <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple event</span>
   called <code title="event-seeking">seeking</code> at the
   element.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the seek was in response to a DOM method call or setting
   of a DOM attribute, then continue the script. The remainder of
   these steps must be run asynchronously.</p></li>

   <li><p>The user agent must wait until it has established whether or
   not the <span>media data</span> for the <var title="">new playback
   position</var> is available, and, if it is, until it has decoded
   enough data to play back that position.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <code title="dom-media-seeking">seeking</code> DOM
   attribute must be set to false.</p></li>

   <li><p>The user agent must <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire
   a simple event</span> called <code
   title="event-seeked">seeked</code> at the element.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-seekable"><code>seekable</code></dfn>
  attribute must return a new static <span>normalized
  <code>TimeRanges</code> object</span> that represents the ranges of
  the <span>media resource</span>, if any, that the user agent is able
  to seek to, at the time the attribute is evaluated.</p>

  <p class="note">If the user agent can seek to anywhere in the
  <span>media resource</span>, e.g. because it a simple movie file and
  the user agent and the server support HTTP Range requests, then the
  attribute would return an object with one range, whose start is the
  time of the first frame (typically zero), and whose end is the same
  as the time of the first frame plus the <code
  title="dom-media-duration">duration</code> attribute's value (which
  would equal the time of the last frame).</p>

  <p class="note">The range might be continuously changing, e.g. if
  the user agent is buffering a sliding window on an infinite
  stream. This is the behavior seen with DVRs viewing live TV, for
  instance.</p>

  <p><span title="media resource">Media resources</span> might be
  internally scripted or interactive. Thus, a <span>media
  element</span> could play in a non-linear fashion. If this happens,
  the user agent must act as if the algorithm for <span
  title="dom-media-seek">seeking</span> was used whenever the
  <span>current playback position</span> changes in a discontinuous
  fashion (so that the relevant events fire).</p>



  <h5>User interface</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-media-controls"><code>controls</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>. If the attribute is
  present, or if <span title="concept-n-noscript">scripting is
  disabled</span> for the <span>media element</span>, then the user
  agent should <dfn>expose a user interface to the user</dfn>. This
  user interface should include features to begin playback, pause
  playback, seek to an arbitrary position in the content (if the
  content supports arbitrary seeking), change the volume, and show the
  media content in manners more suitable to the user (e.g. full-screen
  video or in an independent resizable window). Other controls may
  also be made available.</p>

  <p>If the attribute is absent, then the user agent should avoid
  making a user interface available that could conflict with an
  author-provided user interface. User agents may make the following
  features available, however, even when the attribute is absent:</p>

  <p>User agents may provide controls to affect playback of the media
  resource (e.g. play, pause, seeking, and volume controls), but such
  features should not interfere with the page's normal rendering. For
  example, such features could be exposed in the <span>media
  element</span>'s context menu.</p>

  <p>Where possible (specifically, for starting, stopping, pausing,
  and unpausing playback, for muting or changing the volume of the
  audio, and for seeking), user interface features exposed by the user
  agent must be implemented in terms of the DOM API described above,
  so that, e.g., all the same events fire.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-controls"><code>controls</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must <span>reflect</span> the content attribute of the
  same name.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-volume"><code>volume</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the playback volume of any audio portions of
  the <span>media element</span>, in the range 0.0 (silent) to 1.0
  (loudest). Initially, the volume must be 1.0, but user agents may
  remember the last set value across sessions, on a per-site basis or
  otherwise, so the volume may start at other values. On setting, if
  the new value is in the range 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive, the attribute
  must be set to the new value and the playback volume must be
  correspondingly adjusted as soon as possible after setting the
  attribute, with 0.0 being silent, and 1.0 being the loudest setting,
  values in between increasing in loudness. The range need not be
  linear. The loudest setting may be lower than the system's loudest
  possible setting; for example the user could have set a maximum
  volume. If the new value is outside the range 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive,
  then, on setting, an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception must be
  raised instead.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-media-muted"><code>muted</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if the audio channels are muted and false
  otherwise. Initially, the audio channels should not be muted
  (false), but user agents may remember the last set value across
  sessions, on a per-site basis or otherwise, so the muted state may
  start as muted (true). On setting, the attribute must be set to the
  new value; if the new value is true, audio playback for this
  <span>media resource</span> must then be muted, and if false, audio
  playback must then be enabled.</p>

  <p>Whenever either the <code title="dom-media-muted">muted</code> or
  <code title="dom-media-volume">volume</code> attributes are changed,
  the user agent must <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple
  event</span> called <code
  title="event-volumechange">volumechange</code> at the <span>media
  element</span>.</p>



  <h5>Time ranges</h5>

  <p>Objects implementing the <code>TimeRanges</code> interface
  represent a list of ranges (periods) of time.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>TimeRanges</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-TimeRanges-length">length</span>;
  float <span title="dom-TimeRanges-start">start</span>(in unsigned long index);
  float <span title="dom-TimeRanges-end">end</span>(in unsigned long index);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-TimeRanges-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must return the number of ranges represented by the object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-TimeRanges-start"><code>start(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the position
  of the start of the <var title="">index</var>th range represented by
  the object, in seconds measured from the start of the timeline that
  the object covers.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-TimeRanges-end"><code>end(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the position
  of the end of the <var title="">index</var>th range represented by
  the object, in seconds measured from the start of the timeline that
  the object covers.</p>

  <p>These methods must raise <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exceptions
  if called with an <var title="">index</var> argument greater than or
  equal to the number of ranges represented by the object.</p>

  <p>When a <code>TimeRanges</code> object is said to be a
  <dfn>normalized <code>TimeRanges</code> object</dfn>, the ranges it
  represents must obey the following criteria:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The start of a range must be greater than the end of all
   earlier ranges.</li>

   <li>The start of a range must be less than the end of that same
   range.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>In other words, the ranges in such an object are ordered, don't
  overlap, aren't empty, and don't touch (adjacent ranges are folded
  into one bigger range).</p>

  <p>The timelines used by the objects returned by the <code
  title="dom-media-buffered">buffered</code>, <code
  title="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code> and <code
  title="dom-media-played">played</code> DOM attributes of <span
  title="media element">media elements</span> must be the same as that
  element's <span>media resource</span>'s timeline.</p>

  document when a more suitable element is available. For example, it
  is inappropriate to use a <code>canvas</code> element to render a
  page heading: if the desired presentation of the heading is
  graphically intense, it should be marked up using appropriate
  elements (typically <code>h1</code>) and then styled using CSS and
  supporting technologies such as XBL.</p>

  <p>When authors use the <code>canvas</code> element, they should
  also provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys
  essentially the same function or purpose as the bitmap canvas. This
  content may be placed as content of the <code>canvas</code>
  element. The contents of the <code>canvas</code> element, if any,
  are the element's <span>fallback content</span>.</p>

  <p>In interactive visual media, if <span
  title="concept-n-script">scripting is enabled</span> for the
  <code>canvas</code> element, the <code>canvas</code> element
  represents an embedded element with a dynamically created image.</p>

  <p>In non-interactive, static, visual media, if the
  <code>canvas</code> element has been previously painted on (e.g. if
  the page was viewed in an interactive visual medium and is now being
  printed, or if some script that ran during the page layout process
  painted on the element), then the <code>canvas</code> element
  represents <span>embedded content</span> with the current image and
  size. Otherwise, the element represents its <span>fallback
  content</span> instead.</p>

  <p>In non-visual media, and in visual media if <span
  title="concept-n-noscript">scripting is disabled</span> for the
  <code>canvas</code> element, the <code>canvas</code> element
  represents its <span>fallback content</span> instead.</p>

  <p>The <code>canvas</code> element has two attributes to control the
  size of the coordinate space: <dfn
  title="attr-canvas-width"><code>width</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="attr-canvas-height"><code>height</code></dfn>. These
  attributes, when specified, must have values that are <span
  title="valid non-negative integer">valid non-negative
  integers</span>. The <span>rules for parsing non-negative
  integers</span> must be used to obtain their numeric values. If an
  attribute is missing, or if parsing its value returns an error, then
  the default value must be used instead. The <code
  title="attr-canvas-width">width</code> attribute defaults to 300,
  and the <code title="attr-canvas-height">height</code> attribute
  defaults to 150.</p>

  <p>The intrinsic dimensions of the <code>canvas</code> element equal
  the size of the coordinate space, with the numbers interpreted in
  CSS pixels. However, the element can be sized arbitrarily by a
  style sheet. During rendering, the image is scaled to fit this layout
  size.</p>

  <p>The size of the coordinate space does not necessarily represent
  the size of the actual bitmap that the user agent will use
  internally or during rendering. On high-definition displays, for
  instance, the user agent may internally use a bitmap with two device
  pixels per unit in the coordinate space, so that the rendering
  remains at high quality throughout.</p>

  <p>Whenever the <code title="attr-canvas-width">width</code> and
  <code title="attr-canvas-height">height</code> attributes are set
  (whether to a new value or to the previous value), the bitmap and
  any associated contexts must be cleared back to their initial state
  and reinitialized with the newly specified coordinate space
  dimensions.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-canvas-width"><code>width</code></dfn> and
  <dfn title="dom-canvas-height"><code>height</code></dfn> DOM
  attributes must <span>reflect</span> the respective content
  attributes of the same name.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Only one square appears to be drawn in the following example:</p>
   <pre>
  // canvas is a reference to a &lt;canvas> element
  var context = canvas.getContext('2d');
  context.fillRect(0,0,50,50);
  canvas.setAttribute('width', '300'); // clears the canvas
  context.fillRect(0,100,50,50);
  canvas.width = canvas.width; // clears the canvas
  context.fillRect(100,0,50,50); // only this square remains</pre>
  </div>


  <p>When the canvas is initialized it must be set to fully
  transparent black.</p>


  <p>To draw on the canvas, authors must first obtain a reference to a
  <dfn>context</dfn> using the <dfn
  title="dom-canvas-getContext"><code>getContext(<var
  title="">contextId</var>)</code></dfn> method of the
  <code>canvas</code> element.</p>

  <p>This specification only defines one context, with the name "<code
  title="canvas-context-2d">2d</code>". If <code
  title="dom-canvas-getContext">getContext()</code> is called with
  that exact string for its <var title="">contextId</var> argument,
  then the UA must return a reference to an object implementing
  <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code>. Other specifications may
  define their own contexts, which would return different objects.</p>

  <p>Vendors may also define experimental contexts using the syntax
  <code><var title="">vendorname</var>-<var
  title="">context</var></code>, for example, <code>moz-3d</code>.</p>

  <p>When the UA is passed an empty string or a string specifying a
  context that it does not support, then it must return null. String
  comparisons must be <span>case-sensitive</span>.</p>

  <p>Arguments other than the <var title="">contextId</var> must be
  ignored.</p>

  <p class="note">A future version of this specification will probably
  define a <code>3d</code> context (probably based on the OpenGL ES
  API).</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-canvas-toDataURL"><code>toDataURL()</code></dfn> method
  must, when called with no arguments, return a <code
  title="">data:</code> URL containing a representation of the image
  as a PNG file. <a href="#refsPNG">[PNG]</a>.</p>

  <p>If the canvas has no pixels (i.e. either its horizontal dimension
  or its vertical dimension is zero) then the method must return the
  string "<code title="">data:,</code>". (This is the shortest <code
  title="">data:</code> URL; it represents the empty string in a <code
  title="">text/plain</code> resource.)</p>

  <p>When the <code title="dom-canvas-toDataURL">toDataURL(<var
  title="">type</var>)</code> method, when called with one
  <em>or more</em> arguments, must return a <code
  title="">data:</code> URL containing a representation of the image
  in the format given by <var title="">type</var>. The possible values
  are MIME types with no parameters, for example
  <code>image/png</code>, <code>image/jpeg</code>, or even maybe
  <code>image/svg+xml</code> if the implementation actually keeps
  enough information to reliably render an SVG image from the
  canvas.</p>

  <p>For image types that do not support an alpha channel, the image
  must be composited onto a solid black background using the
  source-over operator, and the resulting image must be the one used
  to create the <code title="">data:</code> URL.</p>

  <p>Only support for <code>image/png</code> is required. User agents
  may support other types. If the user agent does not support the
  requested type, it must return the image using the PNG format.</p>

  <p>User agents must <span title="converted to lowercase">convert the
  provided type to lower case</span> before establishing if they
  support that type and before creating the <code
  title="">data:</code> URL.</p>

  <p class="note">When trying to use types other than
  <code>image/png</code>, authors can check if the image was really
  returned in the requested format by checking to see if the returned
  string starts with one the exact strings "<code
  title="">data:image/png,</code>" or "<code
  title="">data:image/png;</code>". If it does, the image is PNG, and
  thus the requested type was not supported. (The one exception to
  this is if the canvas has either no height or no width, in which
  case the result might simply be "<code title="">data:,</code>".)</p>

  <p>If the method is invoked with the first argument giving a type
  corresponding to one of the types given in the first column of the
  following table, and the user agent supports that type, then the
  subsequent arguments, if any, must be treated as described in the
  second cell of that row.</p>

  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr> <th> Type <th> Other arguments
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td> image/jpeg
     <td> The second argument, if it is a number between 0.0 and 1.0,
     must be treated as the desired quality level. If it is not a
     number or is outside that range, the user agent must use its
     default value, as if the argument had been omitted.
  </table>

  <p>Other arguments must be ignored and must not cause the user agent
  to raise an exception. A future version of this specification will
  probably define other parameters to be passed to <code
  title="dom-canvas-toDataURL">toDataURL()</code> to allow authors to
  more carefully control compression settings, image metadata,
  etc.</p>


  <h5>The 2D context</h5>
  <!-- v2: we're on v3. suggestions for next version are marked v4. -->

  <p>When the <code title="dom-canvas-getContext">getContext()</code>
  method of a <code>canvas</code> element is invoked with <dfn
  title="canvas-context-2d"><code>2d</code></dfn> as the argument, a
  <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> object is returned.</p>

  <p>There is only one <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> object
  per canvas, so calling the <code
  title="dom-canvas-getContext">getContext()</code> method with the
  <code title="canvas-context-2d">2d</code> argument a second time
  must return the same object.</p>

  <p>The 2D context represents a flat Cartesian surface whose origin
  (0,0) is at the top left corner, with the coordinate space having
  <var title="">x</var> values increasing when going right, and <var
  title="">y</var> values increasing when going down.</p>

  <p>Whenever the CSS value <code title="">currentColor</code> is used
  as a color in this API, the "computed value of the 'color' property"
  for the purposes of determining the computed value of the <code
  title="">currentColor</code> keyword is the computed value of the
  'color' property on the element in question at the time that the
  color is specified (e.g. when the appropriate attribute is set, or
  when the method is called; not when the color is rendered or
  otherwise used). If the computed value of the 'color' property is
  undefined for a particular case (e.g. because the element is not in
  a document), then the "computed value of the 'color' property" for
  the purposes of determining the computed value of the <code
  title="">currentColor</code> keyword is fully opaque black. <a
  href="#refsCSS3COLOR">[CSS3COLOR]</a></p>




  <h6>The canvas state</h6>

  <p>Each context maintains a stack of drawing states. <dfn
  title="drawing state">Drawing states</dfn> consist of:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li>The current <span title="dom-context-2d-transformation">transformation matrix</span>.</li>
   <li>The current <span>clipping region</span>.</li>
   <li>The current values of the following attributes: <code

  <p class="note">The current path and the current bitmap are not part

  <h6><dfn title="dom-context-2d-transformation">Transformations</dfn></h6>

  <p>The transformation matrix is applied to coordinates when creating
  shapes and paths.</p> <!-- conformance criteria for actual drawing
  are described in the various sections below -->

  <p>When the context is created, the transformation matrix must
  initially be the identity transform. It may then be adjusted using
  the transformation methods.</p>

  <p>The transformations must be performed in reverse order. For
  instance, if a scale transformation that doubles the width is
  applied, followed by a rotation transformation that rotates drawing
  operations by a quarter turn, and a rectangle twice as wide as it is
  tall is then drawn on the canvas, the actual result will be a
  square.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-scale"><code>scale(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>)</code></dfn> method must
  add the scaling transformation described by the arguments to the
  transformation matrix. The <var title="">x</var> argument represents
  the scale factor in the horizontal direction and the <var
  title="">y</var> argument represents the scale factor in the
  vertical direction. The factors are multiples.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-rotate"><code>rotate(<var
  title="">angle</var>)</code></dfn> method must add the rotation
  transformation described by the argument to the transformation
  matrix. The <var title="">angle</var> argument represents a
  clockwise rotation angle expressed in radians.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-translate"><code>translate(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>)</code></dfn> method must
  add the translation transformation described by the arguments to the
  transformation matrix. The <var title="">x</var> argument represents
  the translation distance in the horizontal direction and the <var
  title="">y</var> argument represents the translation distance in the
  vertical direction. The arguments are in coordinate space units.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-transform"><code>transform(<var
  title="">m11</var>, <var title="">m12</var>, <var
  title="">m21</var>, <var title="">m22</var>, <var title="">dx</var>,

  current transformation matrix with the matrix described by:</p>

  <table class="matrix">

  title="">m21</var>, <var title="">m22</var>, <var title="">dx</var>,

  transform to the identity matrix, and then invoke the <code><span
  title="dom-context-2d-transform">transform</span>(<var
  title="">m11</var>, <var title="">m12</var>, <var
  title="">m21</var>, <var title="">m22</var>, <var title="">dx</var>,
  <var title="">dy</var>)</code> method with the same arguments.</p>


  <h6>Compositing</h6>

  <p>All drawing operations are affected by the global compositing
  attributes, <code
  title="dom-context-2d-globalAlpha">globalAlpha</code> and <code
  title="dom-context-2d-globalCompositeOperation">globalCompositeOperation</code>.</p>

  <!-- conformance criteria for painting are described in the "drawing
  model" section below -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-globalAlpha"><code>globalAlpha</code></dfn>
  attribute gives an alpha value that is applied to shapes and images
  before they are composited onto the canvas. The value must be in the
  range from 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (no additional
  transparency). If an attempt is made to set the attribute to a value
  outside this range, the attribute must retain its previous
  value. When the context is created, the <code

  initially have the value 1.0.</p>

  <p>The <dfn

  attribute sets how shapes and images are drawn onto the existing
  bitmap, once they have had <code

  <p>On setting, if the user agent does not recognize the specified

  <p>When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-globalCompositeOperation">globalCompositeOperation</code>
  attribute must initially have the value
  <code>source-over</code>.</p>


  <h6>Colors and styles</h6>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-strokeStyle"><code>strokeStyle</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the color or style to use for the lines around
  shapes, and the <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-fillStyle"><code>fillStyle</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the color or style to use inside the
  shapes.</p>

  <p>Both attributes can be either strings,
  <code>CanvasGradient</code>s, or <code>CanvasPattern</code>s. On
  setting, strings must be parsed as CSS &lt;color&gt; values and the
  color assigned, and <code>CanvasGradient</code> and
  <code>CanvasPattern</code> objects must be assigned themselves. <a
  href="#refsCSS3COLOR">[CSS3COLOR]</a> If the value is a string but
  is not a valid color, or is neither a string, a
  <code>CanvasGradient</code>, nor a <code>CanvasPattern</code>, then
  it must be ignored, and the attribute must retain its previous
  value.</p>

  <p>On getting, if the value is a color, then the <span
  title="serialization of a color">serialization of the color</span>
  must be returned. Otherwise, if it is not a color but a
  <code>CanvasGradient</code> or <code>CanvasPattern</code>, then the
  respective object must be returned. (Such objects are opaque and
  therefore only useful for assigning to other attributes or for
  comparison to other gradients or patterns.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn>serialization of a color</dfn> for a color value is a
  string, computed as follows: if it has alpha equal to 1.0, then the
  string is a lowercase six-digit hex value, prefixed with a "#"
  character (U+0023 NUMBER SIGN), with the first two digits
  representing the red component, the next two digits representing the
  green component, and the last two digits representing the blue
  component, the digits being in the range 0-9 a-f (U+0030 to U+0039
  and U+0061 to U+0066). Otherwise, the color value has alpha less
  than 1.0, and the string is the color value in the CSS <code
  title="">rgba()</code> functional-notation format: the literal
  string <code title="">rgba</code> (U+0072 U+0067 U+0062 U+0061)
  followed by a U+0028 LEFT PARENTHESIS, a base-ten integer in the
  range 0-255 representing the red component (using digits 0-9, U+0030
  to U+0039, in the shortest form possible), a literal U+002C COMMA
  and U+0020 SPACE, an integer for the green component, a comma and a
  space, an integer for the blue component, another comma and space, a
  U+0030 DIGIT ZERO, a U+002E FULL STOP (representing the decimal
  point), one or more digits in the range 0-9 (U+0030 to U+0039)
  representing the fractional part of the alpha value, and finally a
  U+0029 RIGHT PARENTHESIS.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-strokeStyle">strokeStyle</code> and <code
  title="dom-context-2d-fillStyle">fillStyle</code> attributes must
  initially have the string value <code title="">#000000</code>.</p>


  <p>There are two types of gradients, linear gradients and radial
  gradients, both represented by objects implementing the opaque
  <code>CanvasGradient</code> interface.</p>

  <p id="interpolation">Once a gradient has been created (see below),
  stops are placed along it to define how the colors are distributed
  along the gradient. The color of the gradient at each stop is the
  color specified for that stop. Between each such stop, the colors
  and the alpha component must be linearly interpolated over the RGBA
  space without premultiplying the alpha value to find the color to
  use at that offset. Before the first stop, the color must be the
  color of the first stop. After the last stop, the color must be the
  color of the last stop. When there are no stops, the gradient is
  transparent black.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-canvasgradient-addColorStop"><code>addColorStop(<var
  title="">offset</var>, <var title="">color</var>)</code></dfn>
  method on the <code>CanvasGradient</code> interface adds a new stop
  to a gradient. If the <var title="">offset</var> is less than 0,
  greater than 1, infinite, or NaN, then an
  <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception must be raised. If the <var
  title="">color</var> cannot be parsed as a CSS color, then a
  <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception must be raised.  Otherwise, the
  gradient must have a new stop placed, at offset <var
  title="">offset</var> relative to the whole gradient, and with the
  color obtained by parsing <var title="">color</var> as a CSS
  &lt;color&gt; value. If multiple stops are added at the same offset
  on a gradient, they must be placed in the order added, with the
  first one closest to the start of the gradient, and each subsequent
  one infinitesimally further along towards the end point (in effect
  causing all but the first and last stop added at each point to be
  ignored).</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-createLinearGradient"><code>createLinearGradient(<var
  title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>, <var title="">x1</var>,
  <var title="">y1</var>)</code></dfn> method takes four arguments
  that represent the start point (<var title="">x0</var>, <var
  title="">y0</var>) and end point (<var title="">x1</var>, <var
  title="">y1</var>) of the gradient. If any of the arguments to <code
  title="dom-context-2d-createLinearGradient">createLinearGradient()</code>
  are infinite or NaN, the method must raise a
  <code>NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR</code> exception. Otherwise, the method must
  return a linear <code>CanvasGradient</code> initialized with the
  specified line.</p>

  <p>Linear gradients must be rendered such that all points on a line
  perpendicular to the line that crosses the start and end points have
  the color at the point where those two lines cross (with the colors
  coming from the <a href="#interpolation">interpolation and
  extrapolation</a> described above). The points in the linear
  gradient must be transformed as described by the <span
  title="dom-context-2d-transformation">current transformation
  matrix</span> when rendering.</p>

  <p>If <span><var title="">x<sub>0</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var
  title="">x<sub>1</sub></var></span> and <span><var
  title="">y<sub>0</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var
  title="">y<sub>1</sub></var></span>, then the linear gradient must
  paint nothing.</p> <!-- XXX could make this paint the start color,
  or the end color, or raise an exception -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-createRadialGradient"><code>createRadialGradient(<var
  title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>, <var title="">r0</var>,
  <var title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>, <var
  title="">r1</var>)</code></dfn> method takes six arguments, the
  first three representing the start circle with origin (<var
  title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) and radius <var
  title="">r0</var>, and the last three representing the end circle
  with origin (<var title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>) and
  radius <var title="">r1</var>. The values are in coordinate space
  units. If any of the arguments are infinite or NaN, a
  <code>NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR</code> exception must be raised. If either
  of <var title="">r0</var> or <var title="">r1</var> are negative, an
  <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception must be raised.  Otherwise,
  the method must return a radial <code>CanvasGradient</code>
  initialized with the two specified circles.</p>

  <p>Radial gradients must be rendered by following these steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If <span><var title="">x<sub>0</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var
   title="">x<sub>1</sub></var></span> and <span><var
   title="">y<sub>0</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var
   title="">y<sub>1</sub></var></span> and <span><var
   title="">r<sub>0</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var
   title="">r<sub>1</sub></var></span>, then the radial gradient must
   paint nothing. Abort these steps.</p> <!-- XXX could make this
   paint the start color, or the end color, or a circle of one in
   the other, or raise an exception --> </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <span>x(<var title="">&omega;</var>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var
    title="">x<sub>1</sub></var>-<var

    title="">r<sub>0</sub></var></span></p>

    <p>Let the color at <var title="">&omega;</var> be the color at
    that position on the gradient (with the colors coming from the <a
    href="#interpolation">interpolation and extrapolation</a>
    described above).</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>For all values of <var title="">&omega;</var> where

   canvas that have not yet been painted on by earlier circles in this
   step for this rendering of the gradient.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">This effectively creates a cone, touched by the two
  circles defined in the creation of the gradient, with the part of
  the cone before the start circle (0.0) using the color of the first
  offset, the part of the cone after the end circle (1.0) using the
  color of the last offset, and areas outside the cone untouched by
  the gradient (transparent black).</p>

  <p>Gradients must be painted only where the relevant stroking or
  filling effects requires that they be drawn.</p>

  <p>The points in the radial gradient must be transformed as
  described by the <span title="dom-context-2d-transformation">current
  transformation matrix</span> when rendering.</p>

<!--
  <p>Support for actually painting gradients is optional. Instead of
  painting the gradients, user agents may instead just paint the first
  stop's color. However, <code
  title="dom-context-2d-createLinearGradient">createLinearGradient()</code>
  and <code
  title="dom-context-2d-createRadialGradient">createRadialGradient()</code>
  must always return objects when passed valid arguments.</p>
-->


  <p>Patterns are represented by objects implementing the opaque
  <code>CanvasPattern</code> interface.</p>

  <p>To create objects of this type, the <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-createPattern"><code>createPattern(<var
  title="">image</var>, <var title="">repetition</var>)</code></dfn>
  method is used. The first argument gives the image to use as the
  pattern (either an <code>HTMLImageElement</code> or an
  <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code>). Modifying this image after calling
  the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-createPattern">createPattern()</code> method
  must not affect the pattern. The second argument must be a string
  with one of the following values: <code title="">repeat</code>,
  <code title="">repeat-x</code>, <code title="">repeat-y</code>,
  <code title="">no-repeat</code>. If the empty string or null is
  specified, <code title="">repeat</code> must be assumed. If an
  unrecognized value is given, then the user agent must raise a
  <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception. User agents must recognize the
  four values described above exactly (e.g. they must not do case
  folding). The method must return a <code>CanvasPattern</code> object
  suitably initialized.</p>

  <p>The <var title="">image</var> argument must be an instance of an
  <code>HTMLImageElement</code> or <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code>. If
  the <var title="">image</var> is of the wrong type or null, the
  implementation must raise a <code>TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>
  <!-- drawImage() has an equivalent paragraph -->

  <p>If the <var title="">image</var> argument is an
  <code>HTMLImageElement</code> object whose <code
  title="dom-img-complete">complete</code> attribute is false, then
  the implementation must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>
  <!-- drawImage() has an equivalent paragraph -->

  <p>If the <var title="">image</var> argument is an
  <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code> object with either a horizontal
  dimension or a vertical dimension equal to zero, then the
  implementation must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>
  <!-- drawImage() has an equivalent paragraph -->

  <p>Patterns must be painted so that the top left of the first image
  is anchored at the origin of the coordinate space, and images are
  then repeated horizontally to the left and right (if the
  <code>repeat-x</code> string was specified) or vertically up and
  down (if the <code>repeat-y</code> string was specified) or in all
  four directions all over the canvas (if the <code>repeat</code>
  string was specified). The images are not scaled by this process;
  one CSS pixel of the image must be painted on one coordinate space
  unit. Of course, patterns must actually be painted only where the
  stroking or filling effect requires that they be drawn, and are
  affected by the current transformation matrix.</p>

  <p>When the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-createPattern">createPattern()</code> method
  is passed, as its <var title="">image</var> argument, an animated
  image, the poster frame of the animation, or the first frame of the
  animation if there is no poster frame, must be used.</p>
  <!-- drawImage() has an equivalent paragraph -->

  <!--
   XXXv4 Requests for v4 features:
    * apply transforms to patterns, so you don't have to create
      transformed patterns manually by rendering them to an off-screen
      canvas then using that canvas as the pattern.

  <h6>Line styles</h6>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-lineWidth"><code>lineWidth</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the width of lines, in coordinate space units. On
  setting, zero, negative, infinite, and NaN values must be ignored,
  leaving the value unchanged.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-lineWidth">lineWidth</code> attribute must
  initially have the value <code>1.0</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-lineCap"><code>lineCap</code></dfn> attribute
  defines the type of endings that UAs will place on the end of
  lines. The three valid values are <code>butt</code>,
  <code>round</code>, and <code>square</code>. The <code>butt</code>
  value means that the end of each line has a flat edge perpendicular
  to the direction of the line (and that no additional line cap is
  added). The <code>round</code> value means that a semi-circle with
  the diameter equal to the width of the line must then be added on to
  the end of the line. The <code>square</code> value means that a
  rectangle with the length of the line width and the width of half
  the line width, placed flat against the edge perpendicular to the
  direction of the line, must be added at the end of each line. On
  setting, any other value than the literal strings <code>butt</code>,
  <code>round</code>, and <code>square</code> must be ignored, leaving
  the value unchanged.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-lineCap">lineCap</code> attribute must
  initially have the value <code>butt</code>.</p>


  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-lineJoin"><code>lineJoin</code></dfn>
  attribute defines the type of corners that UAs will place where two
  lines meet. The three valid values are <code>bevel</code>,
  <code>round</code>, and <code>miter</code>.</p>

  <p>On setting, any other value than the literal strings
  <code>bevel</code>, <code>round</code>, and <code>miter</code> must
  be ignored, leaving the value unchanged.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-lineJoin">lineJoin</code> attribute must
  initially have the value <code>miter</code>.</p>

  <p>A join exists at any point in a subpath shared by two consecutive
  lines. When a subpath is closed, then a join also exists at its
  first point (equivalent to its last point) connecting the first and
  last lines in the subpath.</p>

  <p>In addition to the point where the join occurs, two additional
  points are relevant to each join, one for each line: the two corners
  found half the line width away from the join point, one
  perpendicular to each line, each on the side furthest from the other
  line.</p>

  <p>A filled triangle connecting these two opposite corners with a
  straight line, with the third point of the triangle being the join
  point, must be rendered at all joins. The <code
  title="dom-context-2d-lineJoin">lineJoin</code> attribute controls
  whether anything else is rendered. The three aforementioned values
  have the following meanings:</p>

  <p>The <code>bevel</code> value means that this is all that is
  rendered at joins.</p>

  <p>The <code>round</code> value means that a filled arc connecting
  the two aforementioned corners of the join, abutting (and not
  overlapping) the aforementioned triangle, with the diameter equal to
  the line width and the origin at the point of the join, must be
  rendered at joins.</p>

  <p>The <code>miter</code> value means that a second filled triangle
  must (if it can given the miter length) be rendered at the join,
  with one line being the line between the two aforementioned corners,
  abutting the first triangle, and the other two being continuations of
  the outside edges of the two joining lines, as long as required to
  intersect without going over the miter length.</p>

  <p>The miter length is the distance from the point where the lines
  touch on the inside of the join to the intersection of the line
  edges on the outside of the join. The miter limit ratio is the
  maximum allowed ratio of the miter length to half the line width. If
  the miter length would cause the miter limit ratio to be exceeded,
  this second triangle must not be rendered.</p>


  <p>The miter limit ratio can be explicitly set using the <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-miterLimit"><code>miterLimit</code></dfn>
  attribute. On setting, zero, negative, infinite, and NaN values must
  be ignored, leaving the value unchanged.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-miterLimit">miterLimit</code> attribute must
  initially have the value <code>10.0</code>.</p>


  <!-- XXX this section doesn't say what these attributes return or
  what they do on setting. not a big deal; it's pretty obvious. but if
  anyone complains, we'll have to add it -->

  <!--
XXXv4 dashed lines have been requested.  Philip Taylor provides these
notes on what would need to be defined for dashed lines:

  <h6><dfn>Shadows</dfn></h6>

  <p>All drawing operations are affected by the four global shadow
  attributes.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-shadowColor"><code>shadowColor</code></dfn>
  attribute sets the color of the shadow.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-shadowColor">shadowColor</code> attribute
  initially must be fully-transparent black.</p>

  <p>On getting, the <span title="serialization of a
  color">serialization of the color</span> must be returned.</p>

  <p>On setting, the new value must be parsed as a CSS &lt;color&gt;
  value and the color assigned. If the value is not a valid color,
  then it must be ignored, and the attribute must retain its previous
  value.  <a href="#refsCSS3COLOR">[CSS3COLOR]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-shadowOffsetX"><code>shadowOffsetX</code></dfn>
  and <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-shadowOffsetY"><code>shadowOffsetY</code></dfn>
  attributes specify the distance that the shadow will be offset in
  the positive horizontal and positive vertical distance
  respectively. Their values are in coordinate space units. They are
  not affected by the current transformation matrix.</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the shadow offset attributes must
  initially have the value <code>0</code>.</p>

  <p>On getting, they must return their current value. On setting, the
  attribute being set must be set to the new value, except if the
  value is infinite or NaN, in which case the new value must be
  ignored.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-shadowBlur"><code>shadowBlur</code></dfn>
  attribute specifies the size of the blurring effect. (The units do
  not map to coordinate space units, and are not affected by the
  current transformation matrix.)</p>

  <p>When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-shadowBlur">shadowBlur</code> attribute must
  initially have the value <code>0</code>.</p>

  <p>On getting, the attribute must return its current value. On
  setting the attribute must be set to the new value, except if the
  value is negative, infinite or NaN, in which case the new value must

  <p>When shadows are drawn, they must be rendered as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li> <p>Let <var title="">A</var> be the source image for which a
   shadow is being created.</p> </li>

   <li> <p>Let <var title="">B</var> be an infinite transparent black
   bitmap, with a coordinate space and an origin identical to <var
   title="">A</var>.</p> </li>

   <li> <p>Copy the alpha channel of <var title="">A</var> to <var
   title="">B</var>, offset by <code
   title="dom-context-2d-shadowOffsetX">shadowOffsetX</code> in the
   positive <var title="">x</var> direction, and <code

   <li> <p>If <code

   0:</p>

    <ol>

     <li> <p>If <code

     let <var title="">&sigma;</var> be the square root of multiplying
     the value of <code

     2.</p></li>

     <li> <p>Perform a 2D Gaussian Blur on <var title="">B</var>,
     using <var title="">&sigma;</var> as the standard
     deviation. </li> <!-- need a reference for this XXX -->

    </ol>

    <p>User agents may limit values of <var title="">&sigma;</var> to

  <h6>Simple shapes (rectangles)</h6>

  <p>There are three methods that immediately draw rectangles to the
  bitmap. They each take four arguments; the first two give the <var
  title="">x</var> and <var title="">y</var> coordinates of the top
  left of the rectangle, and the second two give the width <var
  title="">w</var> and height <var title="">h</var> of the rectangle,
  respectively.</p>

  <p>The <span title="dom-context-2d-transformation">current
  transformation matrix</span> must be applied to the following four
  coordinates, which form the path that must then be closed to get the
  specified rectangle: <span>(<var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>)</span>, <span>(<span><var title="">x</var>+<var
  title="">w</var></span>, <var title="">y</var>)</span>,
  <span>(<span><var title="">x</var>+<var title="">w</var></span>,
  <span><var title="">y</var>+<var title="">h</var></span>)</span>,
  <span>(<var title="">x</var>, <span><var title="">y</var>+<var
  title="">h</var></span>)</span>.</p>

  <p>Shapes are painted without affecting the current path, and are
  subject to the <span title="clipping region">clipping region</span>,
  and, with the exception of <code
  title="dom-context-2d-clearRect">clearRect()</code>, also <span
  title="shadows">shadow effects</span>, <span
  title="dom-context-2d-globalAlpha">global alpha</span>, and <span
  title="dom-context-2d-globalCompositeOperation">global composition
  operators</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-clearRect"><code>clearRect(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>, <var title="">w</var>, <var
  title="">h</var>)</code></dfn> method must clear the pixels in the
  specified rectangle that also intersect the current clipping region
  to a fully transparent black, erasing any previous image. If either
  height or width are zero, this method has no effect.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-fillRect"><code>fillRect(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>, <var title="">w</var>, <var
  title="">h</var>)</code></dfn> method must paint the specified
  rectangular area using the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-fillStyle">fillStyle</code>. If either height
  or width are zero, this method has no effect.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-strokeRect"><code>strokeRect(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>, <var title="">w</var>, <var
  title="">h</var>)</code></dfn> method must stroke the specified
  rectangle's path using the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-strokeStyle">strokeStyle</code>, <code
  title="dom-context-2d-lineWidth">lineWidth</code>, <code
  title="dom-context-2d-lineJoin">lineJoin</code>, and (if
  appropriate) <code
  title="dom-context-2d-miterLimit">miterLimit</code> attributes. If
  both height and width are zero, this method has no effect, since
  there is no path to stroke (it's a point). If only one of the two is
  zero, then the method will draw a line instead (the path for the
  outline is just a straight line along the non-zero dimension).</p>


  <h6>Complex shapes (paths)</h6>

  <p>The context always has a current path. There is only one current
  path, it is not part of the <span title="dom-context-2d-">drawing
  state</span>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>path</dfn> has a list of zero or more subpaths. Each
  subpath consists of a list of one or more points, connected by
  straight or curved lines, and a flag indicating whether the subpath
  is closed or not. A closed subpath is one where the last point of
  the subpath is connected to the first point of the subpath by a
  straight line. Subpaths with fewer than two points are ignored when
  painting the path.</p>

  <p>Initially, the context's path must have zero subpaths.</p>

  <p>The points and lines added to the path by these methods must be
  transformed according to the <span
  title="dom-context-2d-transformation">current transformation
  matrix</span> as they are added.</p>


  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-beginPath"><code>beginPath()</code></dfn>
  method must empty the list of subpaths so that the context once
  again has zero subpaths.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-moveTo"><code>moveTo(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>)</code></dfn> method must
  create a new subpath with the specified point as its first (and
  only) point.</p>


  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-closePath"><code>closePath()</code></dfn>
  method must do nothing if the context has no subpaths. Otherwise, it
  must mark the last subpath as closed, create a new subpath whose
  first point is the same as the previous subpath's first point, and
  finally add this new subpath to the path. (If the last subpath had
  more than one point in its list of points, then this is equivalent
  to adding a straight line connecting the last point back to the
  first point, thus "closing" the shape, and then repeating the last
  <code title="dom-context-2d-moveTo">moveTo()</code> call.)</p>


  <p>New points and the lines connecting them are added to subpaths
  using the methods described below. In all cases, the methods only
  modify the last subpath in the context's paths.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-lineTo"><code>lineTo(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>)</code></dfn> method must do
  nothing if the context has no subpaths. Otherwise, it must connect
  the last point in the subpath to the given point (<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>) using a straight line, and
  must then add the given point (<var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>) to the subpath.</p>


  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-quadraticCurveTo"><code>quadraticCurveTo(<var
  title="">cpx</var>, <var title="">cpy</var>, <var title="">x</var>,
  <var title="">y</var>)</code></dfn> method must do nothing if the
  context has no subpaths. Otherwise it must connect the last point in
  the subpath to the given point (<var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>) using a quadratic B&eacute;zier curve with control
  point (<var title="">cpx</var>, <var title="">cpy</var>), and must
  then add the given point (<var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>) to the subpath. <a href="#refsBEZIER">[BEZIER]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-arcTo"><code>arcTo(<var
  title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>, <var title="">x2</var>,
  <var title="">y2</var>, <var title="">radius</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must do nothing if the context has no subpaths. If the
  context <em>does</em> have a subpath, then the behavior depends on
  the arguments and the last point in the subpath.</p>

  <p>Negative values for <var title="">radius</var> must cause the
  implementation to raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p>Let the point (<var title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) be
  the last point in the subpath.</p>

  <p>If the point (<var title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) is
  equal to the point (<var title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>),
  or if the point (<var title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>) is
  equal to the point (<var title="">x2</var>, <var title="">y2</var>),
  or if the radius <var title="">radius</var> is zero, then the method
  must add the point (<var title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>)
  to the subpath, and connect that point to the previous point (<var
  title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) by a straight line.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the points (<var title="">x0</var>, <var
  title="">y0</var>), (<var title="">x1</var>, <var
  title="">y1</var>), and (<var title="">x2</var>, <var
  title="">y2</var>) all lie on a single straight line, then: if the
  direction from (<var title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) to
  (<var title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>) is the same as the
  direction from (<var title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>) to
  (<var title="">x2</var>, <var title="">y2</var>), then the method
  must add the point (<var title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>)
  to the subpath, and connect that point to the previous point (<var
  title="">x0</var>, <var title="">y0</var>) by a straight line;
  otherwise, the direction from (<var title="">x0</var>, <var
  title="">y0</var>) to (<var title="">x1</var>, <var
  title="">y1</var>) is the opposite of the direction from (<var
  title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>) to (<var
  title="">x2</var>, <var title="">y2</var>), and the method must add
  a point (<var title="">x<sub>&infin;</sub></var>, <var
  title="">y<sub>&infin;</sub></var>) to the subpath, and connect that
  point to the previous point (<var title="">x0</var>, <var
  title="">y0</var>) by a straight line, where (<var
  title="">x<sub>&infin;</sub></var>, <var
  title="">y<sub>&infin;</sub></var>) is the point that is infinitely
  far away from (<var title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>), that
  lies on the same line as (<var title="">x0</var>, <var
  title="">y0</var>), (<var title="">x1</var>, <var
  title="">y1</var>), and (<var title="">x2</var>, <var
  title="">y2</var>), and that is on the same side of (<var
  title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>) on that line as (<var
  title="">x2</var>, <var title="">y2</var>).</p>

  <p>Otherwise, let <var title="">The Arc</var> be the shortest arc
  given by circumference of the circle that has radius <var
  title="">radius</var>, and that has one point tangent to the
  half-infinite line that crosses the point (<var title="">x0</var>,
  <var title="">y0</var>) and ends at the point (<var
  title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>), and that has a different
  point tangent to the half-infinite line that ends at the point (<var
  title="">x1</var>, <var title="">y1</var>) and crosses the point
  (<var title="">x2</var>, <var title="">y2</var>). The points at
  which this circle touches these two lines are called the start and
  end tangent points respectively.</p>

  <p>The method must connect the point (<var title="">x0</var>, <var
  title="">y0</var>) to the start tangent point by a straight line,
  adding the start tangent point to the subpath, and then must connect
  the start tangent point to the end tangent point by <var
  title="">The Arc</var>, adding the end tangent point to the
  subpath.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-arc"><code>arc(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>, <var title="">radius</var>,
  <var title="">startAngle</var>, <var title="">endAngle</var>, <var
  title="">anticlockwise</var>)</code></dfn> method draws an arc. If
  the context has any subpaths, then the method must add a straight
  line from the last point in the subpath to the start point of the
  arc. In any case, it must draw the arc between the start point of
  the arc and the end point of the arc, and add the start and end
  points of the arc to the subpath. The arc and its start and end
  points are defined as follows:</p>

  <p>Consider a circle that has its origin at (<var title="">x</var>,
  <var title="">y</var>) and that has radius <var
  title="">radius</var>. The points at <var title="">startAngle</var>
  and <var title="">endAngle</var> along this circle's circumference,
  measured in radians clockwise from the positive x-axis, are the
  start and end points respectively.</p>

  <p>If the <var title="">anticlockwise</var> argument is false and
  <span><var title="">endAngle</var>-<var
  title="">startAngle</var></span> is equal to or greater than
  <span>2&pi;</span>, or, if the <var title="">anticlockwise</var>
  argument is <em>true</em> and <span><var
  title="">startAngle</var>-<var title="">endAngle</var></span> is
  equal to or greater than <span>2&pi;</span>, then the arc is the
  whole circumference of this circle.</p>

  <!--alternatively (this is not equivalent, but might make more
  sense, if browsers are willing to change to it: <p>If the absolute
  magnitude of the difference between the <var
  title="">startAngle</var> and <var title="">endAngle</var> angles is
  equal to or greater than <span>2&pi;</span>, then the arc is the
  whole circumference of this circle.</p>-->

  <p>Otherwise, the arc is the path along the circumference of this
  circle from the start point to the end point, going anti-clockwise
  if the <var title="">anticlockwise</var> argument is true, and
  clockwise otherwise. Since the points are on the circle, as opposed
  to being simply angles from zero, the arc can never cover an angle
  greater than <span>2&pi;</span> radians. If the two points are the
  same, or if the radius is zero, then the arc is defined as being of
  zero length in both directions.</p>

  <p>Negative values for <var title="">radius</var> must cause the
  implementation to raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-rect"><code>rect(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>, <var title="">w</var>, <var
  title="">h</var>)</code></dfn> method must create a new subpath
  containing just the four points (<var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>), (<var title="">x</var>+<var title="">w</var>,
  <var title="">y</var>), (<var title="">x</var>+<var
  title="">w</var>, <var title="">y</var>+<var title="">h</var>),
  (<var title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>+<var
  title="">h</var>), with those four points connected by straight
  lines, and must then mark the subpath as closed. It must then create
  a new subpath with the point (<var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>) as the only point in the subpath.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-fill"><code>fill()</code></dfn>
  method must fill all the subpaths of the current path, using
  <code title="dom-context-2d-fillStyle">fillStyle</code>, and using
  the non-zero winding number rule. Open subpaths must be implicitly
  closed when being filled (without affecting the actual
  subpaths).</p>

  <p class="note">Thus, if two overlapping but otherwise independent
  subpaths have opposite windings, they cancel out and result in no
  fill. If they have the same winding, that area just gets painted
  once.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-stroke"><code>stroke()</code></dfn> method
  must calculate the strokes of all the subpaths of the current path,
  using the <code title="dom-context-2d-lineWidth">lineWidth</code>,
  <code title="dom-context-2d-lineCap">lineCap</code>, <code
  title="dom-context-2d-lineJoin">lineJoin</code>, and (if
  appropriate) <code
  title="dom-context-2d-miterLimit">miterLimit</code> attributes, and
  then fill the combined stroke area using the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-strokeStyle">strokeStyle</code>
  attribute.</p>

  <p class="note">Since the subpaths are all stroked as one,
  overlapping parts of the paths in one stroke operation are treated
  as if their union was what was painted.</p>

  <p>Paths, when filled or stroked, must be painted without affecting
  the current path, and must be subject to <span
  title="shadows">shadow effects</span>, <span
  title="dom-context-2d-globalAlpha">global alpha</span>, the <span
  title="clipping region">clipping region</span>, and <span
  title="dom-context-2d-globalCompositeOperation">global composition
  operators</span>. (Transformations affect the path when the path is
  created, not when it is painted, though the stroke <em>style</em> is
  still affected by the transformation during painting.)</p>

  <p>Zero-length line segments must be pruned before stroking a
  path. Empty subpaths must be ignored.</p>


  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-clip"><code>clip()</code></dfn>
  method must create a new <dfn>clipping region</dfn> by calculating
  the intersection of the current clipping region and the area
  described by the current path, using the non-zero winding number
  rule. Open subpaths must be implicitly closed when computing the
  clipping region, without affecting the actual subpaths. The new
  clipping region replaces the current clipping region.</p>

  <p>When the context is initialized, the clipping region must be set
  to the rectangle with the top left corner at (0,0) and the width and
  height of the coordinate space.</p>

  <!-- XXXv4
   Jordan OSETE suggests:
    * support ways of extending the clipping region (union instead of intersection)
       - also "add", "subtract", "replace", "intersect" and "xor"
    * support ways of resetting the clipping region without save/restore
  -->


  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-isPointInPath"><code>isPointInPath(<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>)</code></dfn> method must
  return true if the point given by the <var title="">x</var> and <var
  title="">y</var> coordinates passed to the method, when treated as
  coordinates in the canvas coordinate space unaffected by the current
  transformation, is inside the current path as determined by the
  non-zero winding number rule; and must return false
  otherwise. Points on the path itself are considered to be inside the
  path. If either of the arguments is infinite or NaN, then the method
  must return false.</p>


  <h6>Text</h6> <!-- a v3 feature -->

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-context-2d-font"><code>font</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, on setting, must be parsed the same way as the 'font'
  property of CSS (but without supporting property-independent
  stylesheet syntax like 'inherit'), and the resulting font must be
  assigned to the context, with the 'line-height' component forced to
  'normal'. If the new value is syntactically incorrect, then it must
  be ignored, without assigning a new font value. <a
  href="#refsCSS">[CSS]</a><!-- XXX generic version-independent
  reference --></p>

  <p>Font names must be interpreted in the context of the
  <code>canvas</code> element's stylesheets; any fonts embedded using
  <code title="">@font-face</code> must therefore be available. <a
  href="#refsCSSWEBFONTS">[CSSWEBFONTS]</a></p>

  <p>Only vector fonts should be used by the user agent; if a user
  agent were to use bitmap fonts then transformations would likely
  make the font look very ugly.</p>

  <p>On getting, the <code title="dom-context-2d-font">font</code>
  attribute must return the serialized form of the current font of the
  context. <a href="#refsCSSOM">[CSSOM]</a><!-- XXX ensure that this
  defines serialization of 'font' --></p>

  <p>When the context is created, the font of the context must be set
  to 10px sans-serif. When the 'font-size' component is set to lengths
  using percentages, 'em' or 'ex' units, or the 'larger' or 'smaller'
  keywords, these must be interpreted relative to the computed value
  of the 'font-size' property of the corresponding <code>canvas</code>
  element at the time that the attribute is set. When the
  'font-weight' component is set to the relative values 'bolder' and
  'lighter', these must be interpreted relative to the computed value
  of the 'font-weight' property of the corresponding
  <code>canvas</code> element at the time that the attribute is
  set. If the computed values are undefined for a particular case
  (e.g. because the <code>canvas</code> element is not in a document),
  then the relative keywords must be interpreted relative to the
  normal-weight 10px sans-serif default.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-textAlign"><code>textAlign</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, on getting, must return the current value. On setting, if
  the value is one of <code title="">start</code>, <code
  title="">end</code>, <code title="">left</code>, <code
  title="">right</code>, or <code title="">center</code>, then the
  value must be changed to the new value. Otherwise, the new value
  must be ignored. When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-textAlign">textAlign</code> attribute must
  initially have the value <code title="">start</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-textBaseline"><code>textBaseline</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute, on getting, must return the current value. On

  title="dom-context-2d-textBaseline-middle">middle</code>, <code

  <code
  title="dom-context-2d-textBaseline-ideographic">ideographic</code>,
  or <code title="dom-context-2d-textBaseline-bottom">bottom</code>,
  then the value must be changed to the new value. Otherwise, the new
  value must be ignored. When the context is created, the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-textBaseline">textBaseline</code> attribute
  must initially have the value <code title="">alphabetic</code>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-context-2d-textBaseline">textBaseline</code>
  attribute's allowed keywords correspond to alignment points in the
  font:</p>

  <p><img src="images/baselines.png" alt="The top of the em square is

  the alphabetic baseline is where characters like &#x00C1;, &#x00FF;,
  &#x0066;, and &#x03A9; are anchored, the ideographic baseline is
  where glyphs like &#x79C1; and &#x9054; are anchored, and the bottom
  of the em square is roughly at the bottom of the glyphs in a
  font. The top and bottom of the bounding box can be far from these
  baselines, due to glyphs extending far outside the em square."></p>

XXXDVT (also check for '- -' bits in the part above) -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-measureText"><code>measureText()</code></dfn>
  method takes one argument, <var title="">text</var>. When the method
  is invoked, the user agent must replace all the <span title="space
  character">space characters</span> in <var title="">text</var> with
  U+0020 SPACE characters, and then must form a hypothetical
  infinitely wide CSS line box containing a single inline box
  containing the text <var title="">text</var>, with all the
  properties at their initial values except the 'font' property of the
  inline element set to the current font of the context, as given by
  the <code title="dom-context-2d-font">font</code> attribute, and
  must then return a new <code>TextMetrics</code> object with its
  <code title="dom-textmetrics-width">width</code> attribute set to
  the width of that inline box, in CSS pixels. <a
  href="#refsCSS">[CSS]</a></p>

  <p>The <code>TextMetrics</code> interface is used for the objects
  returned from <code
  title="dom-context-2d-measureText">measureText()</code>. It has one
  attribute, <dfn
  title="dom-textmetrics-width"><code>width</code></dfn>, which is set
  by the <code title="dom-context-2d-measureText">measureText()</code>
  method.</p>

  <p class="note">Glyphs rendered using <code
  title="dom-context-2d-fillText">fillText()</code> and <code
  title="dom-context-2d-strokeText">strokeText()</code> can spill out
  of the box given by the font size (the em square size) and the width
  returned by <code
  title="dom-context-2d-measureText">measureText()</code> (the text
  width). This version of the specification does not provide a way to
  obtain the bounding box dimensions of the text. If the text is to be
  rendered and removed, care needs to be taken to replace the entire
  area of the canvas that the clipping region covers, not just the box
  given by the em square height and measured text width.</p>

  way to render fragments of documents, rendered using CSS, straight
  to the canvas. This would be provided in preference to a dedicated
  way of doing multiline layout.</p>


  <h6>Images</h6>

  <p>To draw images onto the canvas, the <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-drawImage"><code>drawImage</code></dfn> method
  can be used.</p>

  <p>This method is overloaded with three variants: <code
  title="">drawImage(<var title="">image</var>, <var
  title="">dx</var>, <var title="">dy</var>)</code>, <code
  title="">drawImage(<var title="">image</var>, <var
  title="">dx</var>, <var title="">dy</var>, <var title="">dw</var>,
  <var title="">dh</var>)</code>, and <code title="">drawImage(<var
  title="">image</var>, <var title="">sx</var>, <var
  title="">sy</var>, <var title="">sw</var>, <var title="">sh</var>,
  <var title="">dx</var>, <var title="">dy</var>, <var
  title="">dw</var>, <var title="">dh</var>)</code>. (Actually it is
  overloaded with six; each of those three can take either an
  <code>HTMLImageElement</code> or an <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code>
  for the <var title="">image</var> argument.)  If not specified, the
  <var title="">dw</var> and <var title="">dh</var> arguments must
  default to the values of <var title="">sw</var> and <var
  title="">sh</var>, interpreted such that one CSS pixel in the image
  is treated as one unit in the canvas coordinate space. If the <var
  title="">sx</var>, <var title="">sy</var>, <var title="">sw</var>,
  and <var title="">sh</var> arguments are omitted, they must default
  to 0, 0, the image's intrinsic width in image pixels, and the
  image's intrinsic height in image pixels, respectively.</p>

  <p>The <var title="">image</var> argument must be an instance of an
  <code>HTMLImageElement</code> or <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code>. If
  the <var title="">image</var> is of the wrong type or null, the
  implementation must raise a <code>TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>
  <!-- createPattern() has an equivalent paragraph -->

  <p>If the <var title="">image</var> argument is an
  <code>HTMLImageElement</code> object whose <code
  title="dom-img-complete">complete</code> attribute is false, then
  the implementation must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>
  <!-- createPattern() has an equivalent paragraph -->

  <!-- handled by the next paragraph
  <p>If the <var title="">image</var> argument is an
  <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code> object with either a horizontal
  dimension or a vertical dimension equal to zero, then the
  implementation must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>
  -->
  <!-- createPattern() has an equivalent paragraph -->

  <p>The source rectangle is the rectangle whose corners are the four
  points (<var title="">sx</var>, <var title="">sy</var>), (<span><var
  title="">sx</var>+<var title="">sw</var></span>, <var
  title="">sy</var>), (<span><var title="">sx</var>+<var
  title="">sw</var></span>, <span><var title="">sy</var>+<var
  title="">sh</var></span>), (<var title="">sx</var>, <span><var
  title="">sy</var>+<var title="">sh</var></span>).</p>

  <p>If the source rectangle is not entirely within the source image,
  or if one of the <var title="">sw</var> or <var title="">sh</var>
  arguments is zero, the implementation must raise an
  <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <p>The destination rectangle is the rectangle whose corners are the
  four points (<var title="">dx</var>, <var title="">dy</var>),
  (<span><var title="">dx</var>+<var title="">dw</var></span>, <var
  title="">dy</var>), (<span><var title="">dx</var>+<var
  title="">dw</var></span>, <span><var title="">dy</var>+<var
  title="">dh</var></span>), (<var title="">dx</var>, <span><var
  title="">dy</var>+<var title="">dh</var></span>).</p>

  <p>When <code title="dom-context-2d-drawImage">drawImage()</code> is
  invoked, the region of the image specified by the source rectangle
  must be painted on the region of the canvas specified by the
  destination rectangle, after applying the <span
  title="dom-context-2d-transformation">current transformation
  matrix</span> to the points of the destination rectangle.</p>

  <p><img src="images/drawImage.png" alt=""></p> <!-- no alt="" text
  since the image is just repeating what was stated in the previous
  paragraph. -->

  <p class="note">When a canvas is drawn onto itself, the drawing
  model requires the source to be copied before the image is drawn
  back onto the canvas, so it is possible to copy parts of a canvas
  onto overlapping parts of itself.</p>

  <p>When the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-drawImage">drawImage()</code> method is
  passed, as its <var title="">image</var> argument, an animated
  image, the poster frame of the animation, or the first frame of the
  animation if there is no poster frame, must be used.</p>
  <!-- createPattern() has an equivalent paragraph -->

  <p>Images are painted without affecting the current path, and are
  subject to <span title="shadows">shadow effects</span>, <span
  title="dom-context-2d-globalAlpha">global alpha</span>, the <span
  title="clipping region">clipping region</span>, and <span
  title="dom-context-2d-globalCompositeOperation">global composition
  operators</span>.</p>

  <!-- XXX should somehow say that the image used is the actual image
  of the target element, not the rendered image (e.g. height/width
  attributes don't affect it -->



  <h6><dfn>Pixel manipulation</dfn></h6>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-createImageData"><code>createImageData(<var
  title="">sw</var>, <var title="">sh</var>)</code></dfn> method must
  return an <code>ImageData</code> object representing a rectangle
  with a width in CSS pixels equal to the absolute magnitude of <var
  title="">sw</var> and a height in CSS pixels equal to the absolute
  magnitude of <var title="">sh</var>, filled with transparent
  black.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-context-2d-getImageData"><code>getImageData(<var
  title="">sx</var>, <var title="">sy</var>, <var title="">sw</var>,
  <var title="">sh</var>)</code></dfn> method must return an
  <code>ImageData</code> object representing the underlying pixel data
  for the area of the canvas denoted by the rectangle whose corners are
  the four points (<var title="">sx</var>, <var title="">sy</var>),
  (<span><var title="">sx</var>+<var title="">sw</var></span>, <var
  title="">sy</var>), (<span><var title="">sx</var>+<var
  title="">sw</var></span>, <span><var title="">sy</var>+<var
  title="">sh</var></span>), (<var title="">sx</var>, <span><var
  title="">sy</var>+<var title="">sh</var></span>), in canvas
  coordinate space units. Pixels outside the canvas must be returned
  as transparent black. Pixels must be returned as non-premultiplied
  alpha values.</p>

  <p>If any of the arguments to <code
  title="dom-context-2d-createImageData">createImageData()</code> or
  <code title="dom-context-2d-getImageData">getImageData()</code> are
  infinite or NaN, the method must instead raise a
  <code>NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR</code> exception. If either the <var
  title="">sw</var> or <var title="">sh</var> arguments are zero, the
  method must instead raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p><code>ImageData</code> objects must be initialized so that their
  <dfn title="dom-imagedata-width"><code>width</code></dfn> attribute
  is set to <var title="">w</var>, the number of physical device
  pixels per row in the image data, their <dfn
  title="dom-imagedata-height"><code>height</code></dfn> attribute is
  set to <var title="">h</var>, the number of rows in the image data,
  and their <dfn title="dom-imagedata-data"><code>data</code></dfn>
  attribute is initialized to a <code>CanvasPixelArray</code> object
  holding the image data. At least one pixel's worth of image data
  must be returned.</p>

  <p>The <code>CanvasPixelArray</code> object provides ordered,
  indexed access to the color components of each pixel of the image
  data. The data must be represented in left-to-right order, row by
  row top to bottom, starting with the top left, with each pixel's
  red, green, blue, and alpha components being given in that order for
  each pixel. Each component of each device pixel represented in this
  array must be in the range 0..255, representing the 8 bit value for
  that component. The components must be assigned consecutive indices
  starting with 0 for the top left pixel's red component.</p>

  <p>The <code>CanvasPixelArray</code> object thus represents <var
  title="">h</var>&times;<var title="">w</var>&times;4 integers. The
  <dfn title="dom-canvaspixelarray-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute of a <code>CanvasPixelArray</code> object must return this
  number.</p>

  <p>The object's <span>indices of the supported indexed
  properties</span> are the numbers in the range 0 .. <span><var
  title="">h</var>&times;<var title="">w</var>&times;4-1</span>.</p>

  <p>When a <code>CanvasPixelArray</code> object is <dfn
  title="dom-CanvasPixelArray-get">indexed to retrieve an indexed
  property</dfn> <var title="">index</var>, the value returned must be
  the value of the <var title="">index</var>th component in the
  array.</p>

  <p>When a <code>CanvasPixelArray</code> object is <dfn
  title="dom-CanvasPixelArray-set">indexed to modify an indexed
  property</dfn> <var title="">index</var> with value <var
  title="">value</var>, the value of the <var title="">index</var>th
  component in the array must be set to <var title="">value</var>. JS
  <code>undefined</code> values must be converted to zero. Other
  values must first be converted to numbers using JavaScript's
  ToNumber algorithm, and if the result is a NaN value, then the value
  must be converted to zero. If the result is less than 0, it must be
  clamped to zero. If the result is more than 255, it must be clamped
  to 255. If the number is not an integer, it should be rounded to the
  nearest integer using the IEEE 754r
  <i>convertToIntegerTiesToEven</i> rounding mode. <a
  href="#refsECMA262">[ECMA262]</a> <a
  href="#refsIEEE754r">[IEEE754R]</a></p>

  <p class="note">The width and height (<var title="">w</var> and <var
  title="">h</var>) might be different from the <var title="">sw</var>
  and <var title="">sh</var> arguments to the above methods, e.g. if
  the canvas is backed by a high-resolution bitmap, or if the <var
  title="">sw</var> and <var title="">sh</var> arguments are
  negative.</p>

  <p>The handling of pixel rounding when the specified coordinates do
  not exactly map to the device coordinate space is not defined by
  this specification, except that the following must result in no

  <pre>context.putImageData(context.getImageData(x, y, w, h), x, y);</pre>

  <p>...for any value of <var title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>,
  <var title="">w</var>, and <var title="">h</var>, and the following
  two calls:</p>

  <pre>context.createImageData(w, h);
context.getImageData(0, 0, w, h);</pre>

  <p>...must return <code>ImageData</code> objects with the same
  dimensions, for any value of <var title="">w</var> and <var
  title="">h</var>. In other words, while user agents may round the
  arguments of these methods so that they map to device pixel
  boundaries, any rounding performed must be performed consistently
  for all of the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-getImageData">createImageData()</code>, <code
  title="dom-context-2d-getImageData">getImageData()</code> and <code
  title="dom-context-2d-putImageData">putImageData()</code>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The data returned by <code

   <p>In the following example, the script generates an

  <h5>Color spaces and color correction</h5>

  <p>The <code>canvas</code> APIs must perform color correction at
  only two points: when rendering images with their own gamma
  correction and color space information onto the canvas, to convert
  the image to the color space used by the canvas (e.g. using the
  <code title="dom-context-2d-drawImage">drawImage()</code> method
  with an <code>HTMLImageElement</code> object), and when rendering
  the actual canvas bitmap to the output device.</p>

  <p class="note">Thus, in the 2D context, colors used to draw shapes
  onto the canvas will exactly match colors obtained through the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-getImageData">getImageData()</code>
  method.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-canvas-toDataURL">toDataURL()</code> method
  must not include color space information in the resource
  returned. Where the output format allows it, the color of pixels in
  resources created by <code
  title="dom-canvas-toDataURL">toDataURL()</code> must match those
  returned by the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-getImageData">getImageData()</code>
  method.</p>

  <p>In user agents that support CSS, the color space used by a
  <code>canvas</code> element must match the color space used for
  processing any colors for that element in CSS.</p>

  <p>The gamma correction and color space information of images must
  be handled in such a way that an image rendered directly using an
  <code>img</code> element would use the same colors as one painted on
  a <code>canvas</code> element that is then itself
  rendered. Furthermore, the rendering of images that have no color
  correction information (such as those returned by the <code
  title="dom-canvas-toDataURL">toDataURL()</code> method) must be
  rendered with no color correction.</p>

  <p class="note">Thus, in the 2D context, calling the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-drawImage">drawImage()</code> method to render
  the output of the <code
  title="dom-canvas-toDataURL">toDataURL()</code> method to the
  canvas, given the appropriate dimensions, has no visible effect.</p>


  <h5>Security with <code>canvas</code> elements</h5>

  <p><strong>Information leakage</strong> can occur if scripts from
  one <span>origin</span> can access information (e.g. read pixels)
  from images from another origin (one that isn't the <span
  title="same origin">same</span>).</p>

  <p>To mitigate this, <code>canvas</code> elements are defined to
  have a flag indicating whether they are <i>origin-clean</i>. All
  <code>canvas</code> elements must start with their
  <i>origin-clean</i> set to true. The flag must be set to false if
  any of the following actions occur:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><p>The element's 2D context's <code
   title="dom-context-2d-drawImage">drawImage()</code> method is
   called with an <code>HTMLImageElement</code> whose
   <span>origin</span> is not the <span title="same
   origin">same</span> as that of the <code>Document</code> object
   that owns the <code>canvas</code> element.</p></li>

   <li><p>The element's 2D context's <code
   title="dom-context-2d-drawImage">drawImage()</code> method is
   called with an <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code> whose
   <i>origin-clean</i> flag is false.</p></li>

   <li><p>The element's 2D context's <code
   title="dom-context-2d-fillStyle">fillStyle</code> attribute is set
   to a <code>CanvasPattern</code> object that was created from an
   <code>HTMLImageElement</code> whose <span>origin</span> was not the
   <span title="same origin">same</span> as that of the
   <code>Document</code> object that owns the <code>canvas</code>
   element when the pattern was created.</p></li>

   <li><p>The element's 2D context's <code
   title="dom-context-2d-fillStyle">fillStyle</code> attribute is set
   to a <code>CanvasPattern</code> object that was created from an
   <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code> whose <i>origin-clean</i> flag was
   false when the pattern was created.</p></li>

   <li><p>The element's 2D context's <code
   title="dom-context-2d-strokeStyle">strokeStyle</code> attribute is
   set to a <code>CanvasPattern</code> object that was created from an
   <code>HTMLImageElement</code> whose <span>origin</span> was not the
   <span title="same origin">same</span> as that of the
   <code>Document</code> object that owns the <code>canvas</code>
   element when the pattern was created.</p></li>

   <li><p>The element's 2D context's <code
   title="dom-context-2d-strokeStyle">strokeStyle</code> attribute is
   set to a <code>CanvasPattern</code> object that was created from an
   <code>HTMLCanvasElement</code> whose <i>origin-clean</i> flag was
   false when the pattern was created.</p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>Whenever the <code
  title="dom-canvas-toDataURL">toDataURL()</code> method of a
  <code>canvas</code> element whose <i>origin-clean</i> flag is set to
  false is called, the method must raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p>Whenever the <code
  title="dom-context-2d-getImageData">getImageData()</code> method of
  the 2D context of a <code>canvas</code> element whose
  <i>origin-clean</i> flag is set to false is called with otherwise
  correct arguments, the method must raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p class="note">Even resetting the canvas state by changing its
  <code title="attr-canvas-width">width</code> or <code
  title="attr-canvas-height">height</code> attributes doesn't reset
  the <i>origin-clean</i> flag.</p>

  <p>If the <code>area</code> element has an <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute, then the
  <code>area</code> element represents a <span>hyperlink</span>. In
  this case, the <dfn title="attr-area-alt"><code>alt</code></dfn>
  attribute must be present. It specifies the text of the
  hyperlink. Its value must be text that, when presented with the
  texts specified for the other hyperlinks of the <span>image
  map</span>, and with the alternative text of the image, but without
  the image itself, provides the user with the same kind of choice as
  the hyperlink would when used without its text but with its shape
  applied to the image. The <code title="attr-area-alt">alt</code>
  attribute may be left blank if there is another <code>area</code>
  element in the same <span>image map</span> that points to the same

  <p>If the <code>area</code> element has no <code

  to the center of the circle, the second integer must be the distance
  in CSS pixels from the top edge of the image to the center of the
  circle, and the third integer must be the radius of the circle,
  again in CSS pixels.</p>

  <p>In the <dfn title="attr-area-shape-default">default state</dfn>
  state, <code>area</code> elements must not have a <code
  title="attr-area-coords">coords</code> attribute. (The area is the
  whole image.)</p>

  <p>In the <dfn title="attr-area-shape-poly">polygon state</dfn>,
  <code>area</code> elements must have a <code
  title="attr-area-coords">coords</code> attribute with at least six
  integers, and the number of integers must be even. Each pair of
  integers must represent a coordinate given as the distances from the
  left and the top of the image in CSS pixels respectively, and all
  the coordinates together must represent the points of the polygon,
  in order.</p>

  <p>In the <dfn title="attr-area-shape-rect">rectangle state</dfn>,
  <code>area</code> elements must have a <code
  title="attr-area-coords">coords</code> attribute with exactly four
  integers, the first of which must be less than the third, and the
  second of which must be less than the fourth. The four points must
  represent, respectively, the distance from the left edge of the
  image to the left side of the rectangle, the distance from the
  top edge to the top side, the distance from the left edge to the
  right side, and the distance from the top edge to the bottom side,
  all in CSS pixels.</p>

  <p>When user agents allow users to <span title="following
  hyperlinks">follow hyperlinks</span> created using the
  <code>area</code> element, as described in the next section, the
  <code title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code>,
  <code title="attr-hyperlink-target">target</code> and <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attributes decide how the
  link is followed. The <code title="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code>,
  <code title="attr-hyperlink-media">media</code>, <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-hreflang">hreflang</code>, and <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code> attributes may be used to
  indicate to the user the likely nature of the target resource before
  the user follows the link.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-hyperlink-target">target</code>, <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code>, <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code>, <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-media">media</code>, <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-hreflang">hreflang</code>, and <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code> attributes must be omitted
  if the <code title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute is
  not present.</p>

  <p>The <span>activation behavior</span> of <code>area</code>
  elements is to run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the <code title="event-DOMActivate">DOMActivate</code> event
   in question is not <span
   title="concept-events-trusted">trusted</span> (i.e. a <code
   title="dom-click">click()</code> method call was the reason for the
   event being dispatched), and the <code>area</code> element's <code
   title="attr-area-target">target</code> attribute is <span
   class="XXX">...</span> then raise an
   <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, the user agent must <span title="following
   hyperlinks">follow the hyperlink</span> defined by the
   <code>area</code> element, if any.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The DOM attributes <dfn
  title="dom-area-alt"><code>alt</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-area-coords"><code>coords</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-area-href"><code>href</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-area-target"><code>target</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-area-ping"><code>ping</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-area-rel"><code>rel</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-area-media"><code>media</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-area-hreflang"><code>hreflang</code></dfn>, and <dfn
  title="dom-area-type"><code>type</code></dfn>, each must
  <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the same
  name.</p>

  <p>The DOM attribute <dfn
  title="dom-area-shape"><code>shape</code></dfn> must
  <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-area-shape">shape</code>
  content attribute, <span>limited to only known values</span>.</p>

  <p>The DOM attribute <dfn
  title="dom-area-rellist"><code>relList</code></dfn> must
  <span>reflect</span> the <code title="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code>
  content attribute.</p>

  <h5>Authoring</h5>

  <p>An <dfn>image map</dfn> allows geometric areas on an image to be
  associated with <span title="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span>.</p>

  <p>An image, in the form of an <code>img</code> element or an
  <code>object</code> element representing an image, may be associated
  with an image map (in the form of a <code>map</code> element) by
  specifying a <dfn
  title="attr-hyperlink-usemap"><code>usemap</code></dfn> attribute on
  the <code>img</code> or <code>object</code> element. The <code
  title="attr-area-usemap">usemap</code> attribute, if specified, must
  be a <span>valid hash-name reference</span> to a <code>map</code>
  element.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Consider an image that looks as follows:</p>

   <p><img src="images/sample-usemap.png" alt="A line with four shapes in it, equally spaced: a red hollow box, a green circle, a blue triangle, and a yellow four-pointed star."></p>

   <p>If we wanted just the coloured areas to be clickable, we could
   do it as follows:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>
 Please select a shape:
 &lt;img src="shapes.png" usemap="#shapes"
      alt="Four shapes are available: a red hollow box, a green circle, a blue triangle, and a yellow four-pointed star.">
 &lt;map name="shapes">
  &lt;area shape=rect coords="50,50,100,100"> &lt;!-- the hole in the red box -->
  &lt;area shape=rect coords="25,25,125,125" href="red.html" alt="Red box.">
  &lt;area shape=circle coords="200,75,50" href="green.html" alt="Green circle.">
  &lt;area shape=poly coords="325,25,262,125,388,125" href="blue.html" alt="Blue triangle.">
  &lt;area shape=poly coords="450,25,435,60,400,75,435,90,450,125,465,90,500,75,465,60"
        href="yellow.html" alt="Yellow star.">
 &lt;/map>
&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>


  <h5>Processing model</h5>

  <p>If an <code>img</code> element or an <code>object</code> element
  representing an image has a <code
  title="attr-area-usemap">usemap</code> attribute specified, user
  agents must process it as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>First, <span>rules for parsing a hash-name reference</span>
   to a <code>map</code> element must be followed. This will return
   either an element (the <var title="">map</var>) or null.</p></li>

   <li><p>If that returned null, then abort these steps. The image is
   not associated with an image map after all.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, the user agent must collect all the
   <code>area</code> elements that are descendants of the <var
   title="">map</var>. Let those be the <var
   title="">areas</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>Having obtained the list of <code>area</code> elements that form
  the image map (the <var title="">areas</var>), interactive user
  agents must process the list in one of two ways.</p>

  <p>If the user agent intends to show the text that the
  <code>img</code> element represents, then it must use the following
  steps.</p>

  <p class="note">In user agents that do not support images, or that
  have images disabled, <code>object</code> elements cannot represent
  images, and thus this section never applies (the <span>fallback
  content</span> is shown instead). The following steps therefore only
  apply to <code>img</code> elements.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Remove all the <code>area</code> elements in <var
   title="">areas</var> that have no <code
   title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute.</p></li>

   <li><p>Remove all the <code>area</code> elements in <var
   title="">areas</var> that have no <code
   title="attr-area-alt">alt</code> attribute, or whose <code
   title="attr-area-alt">alt</code> attribute's value is the empty
   string, <em>if</em> there is another <code>area</code> element in
   <var title="">areas</var> with the same value in the <code
   title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute and with a
   non-empty <code title="attr-area-alt">alt</code> attribute.</li>

   <li><p>Each remaining <code>area</code> element in <var
   title="">areas</var> represents a <span>hyperlink</span>. Those
   hyperlinks should all be made available to the user in a manner
   associated with the text of the <code>img</code>.</p>

   <p>In this context, user agents may represent <code>area</code> and
   <code>img</code> elements with no specified <code
   title="">alt</code> attributes, or whose <code title="">alt</code>
   attributes are the empty string or some other non-visible text, in
   a user-agent-defined fashion intended to indicate the lack of
   suitable author-provided text.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>If the user agent intends to show the image and allow interaction
  with the image to select hyperlinks, then the image must be
  associated with a set of layered shapes, taken from the
  <code>area</code> elements in <var title="">areas</var>, in reverse
  tree order (so the last specified <code>area</code> element in the
  <var title="">map</var> is the bottom-most shape, and the first
  element in the <var title="">map</var>, in tree order, is the
  top-most shape).</p>

  <p>Each <code>area</code> element in <var title="">areas</var> must
  be processed as follows to obtain a shape to layer onto the
  image:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Find the state that the element's <code
   title="attr-area-shape">shape</code> attribute represents.</p></li>

   <li><p>Use the <span>rules for parsing a list of integers</span> to
   parse the element's <code title="attr-area-coords">coords</code>
   attribute, if it is present, and let the result be the <var
   title="">coords</var> list. If the attribute is absent, let the
   <var title="">coords</var> list be the empty list.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the number of items in the <var title="">coords</var>
   list is less than the minimum number given for the
   <code>area</code> element's current state, as per the following
   table, then the shape is empty; abort these steps.</p>
    <table>
     <thead>
      <tr>
       <th>State
       <th>Minimum number of items
     <tbody>
      <tr>
       <td><span title="attr-area-shape-circle">Circle state</span>
       <td>3
      <tr>
       <td><span title="attr-area-shape-default">Default state</span>
       <td>0
      <tr>
       <td><span title="attr-area-shape-poly">Polygon state</span>
       <td>6
      <tr>
       <td><span title="attr-area-shape-rect">Rectangle state</span>
       <td>4
    </table>
   </li>

   <li><p>Check for excess items in the <var title="">coords</var>
   list as per the entry in the following list corresponding to the
   <code title="attr-area-shape">shape</code> attribute's state:</p>
    <dl class="switch">
     <dt><span title="attr-area-shape-circle">Circle state</span></dt>
     <dd>Drop any items in the list beyond the third.</dd>
     <dt><span title="attr-area-shape-default">Default state</span></dt>
     <dd>Drop all items in the list.</dd>
     <dt><span title="attr-area-shape-poly">Polygon state</span></dt>
     <dd>Drop the last item if there's an odd number of items.</dd>
     <dt><span title="attr-area-shape-rect">Rectangle state</span></dt>
     <dd>Drop any items in the list beyond the fourth.</dd>
    </dl>
   </li>

   <li><p>If the <code title="attr-area-shape">shape</code> attribute
   represents the <span title="attr-area-shape-rect">rectangle
   state</span>, and the first number in the list is numerically less
   than the third number in the list, then swap those two numbers
   around.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <code title="attr-area-shape">shape</code> attribute
   represents the <span title="attr-area-shape-rect">rectangle
   state</span>, and the second number in the list is numerically less
   than the fourth number in the list, then swap those two numbers
   around.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <code title="attr-area-shape">shape</code> attribute
   represents the <span title="attr-area-shape-circle">circle
   state</span>, and the third number in the list is less than or
   equal to zero, then the shape is empty; abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Now, the shape represented by the element is the one
   described for the entry in the list below corresponding to the
   state of the <code title="attr-area-shape">shape</code>
   attribute:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

      <p>The shape is a circle whose center is <var title="">x</var>
      CSS pixels from the left edge of the image and <var
      title="">x</var> CSS pixels from the top edge of the image, and
      whose radius is <var title="">r</var> pixels.</p>
     </dd>

     <dt><span title="attr-area-shape-default">Default state</span></dt>
     <dd>
      <p>The shape is a rectangle that exactly covers the entire

      title="">i</var>+1)</span>th entry in <var title="">coords</var>
      (the first entry in <var title="">coords</var> being the one
      with index 0).</p>

      <p>Let <var title="">the coordinates</var> be (<var
      title="">x<sub title=""><var title="">i</var></sub></var>, <var

      <p>The shape is a polygon whose vertices are given by <var

      <p>Let <var title="">x1</var> be the first number in <var
      title="">coords</var>, <var title="">y1</var> be the second
      number, <var title="">x2</var> be the third number, and <var
      title="">y2</var> be the fourth number.</p>

      <p>The shape is a rectangle whose top-left corner is given by

      and whose bottom right corner is given by the coordinate (<var

      being interpreted as CSS pixels from the top left corner of the
      image.</p>

     </dd>

    </dl>

    <p>For historical reasons, the coordinates must be interpreted
    relative to the <em>displayed</em> image, even if it stretched

    <code title="">height</code> attributes.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>Mouse clicks on an image associated with a set of layered shapes
  per the above algorithm must be dispatched to the top-most shape
  covering the point that the pointing device indicated (if any), and
  then, must be dispatched again (with a new <code>Event</code>
  object) to the image element itself. User agents may also allow
  individual <code>area</code> elements representing <span
  title="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span> to be selected and activated
  (e.g. using a keyboard); events from this are not also propagated to
  the image.</p>

  <p class="note">Because a <code>map</code> element (and its
  <code>area</code> elements) can be associated with multiple
  <code>img</code> and <code>object</code> elements, it is possible
  for an <code>area</code> element to correspond to multiple focusable
  areas of the document.</p>

  <p>Image maps are <em>live</em>; if the DOM is mutated, then the
  user agent must act as if it had rerun the algorithms for image
  maps.</p>



  <h4>MathML</h4>

  <p>The <code>math</code> element from the <span>MathML
  namespace</span> falls into the <span>embedded content</span>
  category for the purposes of the content models in this
  specification.</p>

  <!-- apparently we get to define error handling, so: -->

  <p>User agents must handle text other than <span>inter-element
  whitespace</span> found in MathML elements whose content models do
  not allow raw text by pretending for the purposes of MathML content
  models, layout, and rendering that that text is actually wrapped in
  an <code title="">mtext</code> element in the <span>MathML
  namespace</span>. (Such text is not, however, conforming.)</p>

  <p>User agents must act as if any MathML element whose contents does
  not match the element's content model was replaced, for the purposes
  of MathML layout and rendering, by an <code title="">merror</code>
  element in the <span>MathML namespace</span> containing some
  appropriate error message.</p>

  <p>To enable authors to use MathML tools that only accept MathML in
  its XML form, interactive HTML user agents are encouraged to
  provide a way to export any MathML fragment as a
  namespace-well-formed XML fragment.</p>


  <h4>SVG</h4>

  <p>The <code>svg</code> element from the <span>SVG namespace</span>
  falls into the <span>embedded content</span> category for the
  purposes of the content models in this specification.</p>

  <p>To enable authors to use SVG tools that only accept SVG in its
  XML form, interactive HTML user agents are encouraged to provide a
  way to export any SVG fragment as a namespace-well-formed XML
  fragment.</p>

  <p>When the SVG <code>foreignObject</code> element contains elements
  from the HTML namespace, such elements must all be <span>flow
  content</span> and must not be interleaved with non-HTML
  elements. <a href="#refsSVG">[SVG]</a></p>


  <h4><dfn>Dimension attributes</dfn></h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-dim-width"><code>width</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="attr-dim-height"><code>height</code></dfn> attributes on
  <code>img</code>, <code>iframe</code>, <code>embed</code>,
  <code>object</code>, <code>video</code>, and, when their <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state,
  <code>input</code> elements may be specified to give the dimensions
  of the visual content of the element (the width and height
  respectively, relative to the nominal direction of the output
  medium), in CSS pixels. The attributes, if specified, must have
  values that are <span title="valid non-negative integer">valid
  non-negative integers</span> greater than zero.</p>

  <p>The specified dimensions given may differ from the dimensions
  specified in the resource itself, since the resource may have a
  resolution that differs from the CSS pixel resolution. (On screens,
  CSS pixels have a resolution of 96ppi, but in general the CSS pixel
  resolution depends on the reading distance.) If both attributes are
  specified, then one of the following statements must be true:</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-table-createTBody"><code>createTBody()</code></dfn>
  method must create a new <code>tbody</code> element, insert it
  immediately after the last <code>tbody</code> element in the
  <code>table</code> element, if any, or at the end of the
  <code>table</code> element if the <code>table</code> element has no
  <code>tbody</code> element children, and then must return the new

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-table-rows"><code>rows</code></dfn> attribute
  must return an <code>HTMLCollection</code> rooted at the

  elements that are either children of the <code>table</code> element,
  or children of <code>thead</code>, <code>tbody</code>, or
  <code>tfoot</code> elements that are themselves children of the
  <code>table</code> element. The elements in the collection must be

  in tree order.</p>

  <p>The behavior of the <dfn
  title="dom-table-insertRow"><code>insertRow(<var

  the table. When it is called, the method must act as required by the
  first item in the following list of conditions that describes the
  state of the table and the <var title="">index</var> argument:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If <var title="">index</var> is less than &#x2212;1 or greater than
   the number of elements in <code title="dom-table-rows">rows</code>
   collection:</dt>

   <dd>The method must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
   exception.</dd>

   <dt>If the <code title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection has
   zero elements in it, and the <code>table</code> has no
   <code>tbody</code> elements in it:</dt>

   <dd>The method must create a <code>tbody</code> element, then
   create a <code>tr</code> element, then append the <code>tr</code>
   element to the <code>tbody</code> element, then append the
   <code>tbody</code> element to the <code>table</code> element, and
   finally return the <code>tr</code> element.</dd>

   <dt>If the <code title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection has
   zero elements in it:</dt>

   <dd>The method must create a <code>tr</code> element, append it to
   the last <code>tbody</code> element in the table, and return the
   <code>tr</code> element.</dd>

   <dt>If <var title="">index</var> is missing, equal to &#x2212;1, or
   equal to the number of items in <code
   title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection:</dt>

   <dd>The method must create a <code>tr</code> element, and append it
   to the parent of the last <code>tr</code> element in the <code
   title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection. Then, the newly
   created <code>tr</code> element must be returned.</dd>

   <dt>Otherwise:</dt>

   <dd>The method must create a <code>tr</code> element, insert it
   immediately before the <var title="">index</var>th <code>tr</code>
   element in the <code title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection,
   in the same parent, and finally must return the newly created
   <code>tr</code> element.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>When the <dfn title="dom-table-deleteRow"><code>deleteRow(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method is called, the user agent
  must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If <var title="">index</var> is equal to &#x2212;1, then
   <var title="">index</var> must be set to the number if items in the
   <code title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection, minus
   one.</p></li>

   <li><p>Now, if <var title="">index</var> is less than zero, or
   greater than or equal to the number of elements in the <code
   title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection, the method must
   instead raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception, and these
   steps must be aborted.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, the method must remove the <var
   title="">index</var>th element in the <code
   title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection from its parent.</p>

  title="concept-row">row</span> of <span
  title="concept-cell">cells</span> in a <span
  title="concept-table">table</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code>tr</code> element takes part in the <span>table
  model</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tr-rowIndex"><code>rowIndex</code></dfn>
  attribute must, if the element has a parent <code>table</code>
  element, or a parent <code>tbody</code>, <code>thead</code>, or
  <code>tfoot</code> element and a <em>grandparent</em>
  <code>table</code> element, return the index of the <code>tr</code>
  element in that <code>table</code> element's <code
  title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection. If there is no such
  <code>table</code> element, then the attribute must return
  &#x2212;1.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-tr-sectionRowIndex"><code>sectionRowIndex</code></dfn>
  attribute must, if the element has a parent <code>table</code>,
  <code>tbody</code>, <code>thead</code>, or <code>tfoot</code>
  element, return the index of the <code>tr</code> element in the
  parent element's <code title="">rows</code> collection (for tables,
  that's the <code title="dom-table-rows">rows</code> collection; for
  table sections, that's the <code title="dom-tbody-rows">rows</code>
  collection). If there is no such parent element, then the attribute
  must return &#x2212;1.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tr-cells"><code>cells</code></dfn> attribute
  must return an <code>HTMLCollection</code> rooted at the
  <code>tr</code> element, whose filter matches only <code>td</code>
  and <code>th</code> elements that are children of the
  <code>tr</code> element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tr-insertCell"><code>insertCell(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must act as follows:</p>

  <p>If <var title="">index</var> is less than &#x2212;1 or greater than the
  number of elements in the <code title="dom-tr-cells">cells</code>
  collection, the method must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p>If <var title="">index</var> is missing, equal to &#x2212;1, or
  equal to the number of items in <code
  title="dom-tr-cells">cells</code> collection, the method must create
  a <code>td</code> element, append it to the <code>tr</code> element,
  and return the newly created <code>td</code> element.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the method must create a <code>td</code> element,
  insert it as a child of the <code>tr</code> element, immediately
  before the <var title="">index</var>th <code>td</code> or
  <code>th</code> element in the <code
  title="dom-tr-cells">cells</code> collection, and finally must
  return the newly created <code>td</code> element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tr-deleteCell"><code>deleteCell(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must remove the <var
  title="">index</var>th element in the <code
  title="dom-tr-cells">cells</code> collection from its parent. If
  <var title="">index</var> is less than zero or greater than or equal
  to the number of elements in the <code
  title="dom-tr-cells">cells</code> collection, the method must
  instead raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>The <dfn title="attr-th-scope-row"><code>row</code></dfn>

  <h4>Attributes common to <code>td</code> and <code>th</code> elements</h4>

  <p>The <code>td</code> and <code>th</code> elements may have a <dfn
  title="attr-tdth-colspan"><code>colspan</code></dfn> content
  attribute specified, whose value must be a <span>valid non-negative
  integer</span> greater than zero.</p>

  <p>The <code>td</code> and <code>th</code> elements may also have a

  integer</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code>td</code> and <code>th</code> element may have a <dfn
  title="attr-tdth-headers"><code>headers</code></dfn> content
  attribute specified. The <code
  title="attr-tdth-headers">headers</code> attribute, if specified,
  must contain a string consisting of an <span>unordered set of unique
  space-separated tokens</span>, each of which must have the value of
  an ID of a <code>th</code> element taking part in the same <span
  title="concept-table">table</span> as the <code>td</code> or

  model</span>).</p>

  <p class="note">The <code title="attr-tdth-colspan">colspan</code>,

  readonly attribute long <span title="dom-tdth-cellIndex">cellIndex</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tdth-colSpan"><code>colSpan</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the content attribute of the
  same name. The value must be <span>limited to only positive non-zero
  numbers</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tdth-rowSpan"><code>rowSpan</code></dfn> DOM

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tdth-cellIndex"><code>cellIndex</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must, if the element has a parent <code>tr</code>
  element, return the index of the cell's element in the parent
  element's <code title="dom-tr-cells">cells</code> collection. If
  there is no such parent element, then the attribute must return
  0.</p>


  <h4>Processing model</h4>

  <p>The various table elements and their content attributes together
  define the <dfn>table model</dfn>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-table">table</dfn> consists of cells
  aligned on a two-dimensional grid of <dfn
  title="concept-slots">slots</dfn> with coordinates (<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>). The grid is finite, and is
  either empty or has one or more slots. If the grid has one or more
  slots, then the <var title="">x</var> coordinates are always in the
  range <span>0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var
  title="">x</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var title="">x<sub
  title="">width</sub></var></span>, and the <var title="">y</var>
  coordinates are always in the range <span>0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var
  title="">y</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var title="">y<sub
  title="">height</sub></var></span>. If one or both of <var
  title="">x<sub title="">width</sub></var> and <var title="">y<sub
  title="">height</sub></var> are zero, then the table is empty (has
  no slots). Tables correspond to <code>table</code> elements.</p>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-cell">cell</dfn> is a set of slots anchored
  at a slot (<var title="">cell<sub title="">x</sub></var>, <var
  title="">cell<sub title="">y</sub></var>), and with a particular
  <var title="">width</var> and <var title="">height</var> such that
  the cell covers all the slots with coordinates (<var
  title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>) where <span><var
  title="">cell<sub title="">x</sub></var>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var
  title="">x</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var title="">cell<sub
  title="">x</sub></var>+<var title="">width</var></span> and
  <span><var title="">cell<sub
  title="">y</sub></var>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var
  title="">y</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var title="">cell<sub
  title="">y</sub></var>+<var title="">height</var></span>. Cells can
  either be <em>data cells</em> or <em>header cells</em>. Data cells
  correspond to <code>td</code> elements, and header cells correspond
  to <code>th</code> elements. Cells of both types can have zero or
  more associated header cells.</p>

  <p>It is possible, in certain error cases, for two cells to occupy
  the same slot.</p>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-row">row</dfn> is a complete set of slots
  from <span><var title="">x</var>=0</span> to <span><var
  title="">x</var>=<var title="">x<sub
  title="">width</sub></var>-1</span>, for a particular value of <var
  title="">y</var>. Rows correspond to <code>tr</code> elements.</p>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-column">column</dfn> is a complete set of
  slots from <span><var title="">y</var>=0</span> to <span><var
  title="">y</var>=<var title="">y<sub
  title="">height</sub></var>-1</span>, for a particular value of <var
  title="">x</var>. Columns can correspond to <code>col</code>
  elements, but in the absence of <code>col</code> elements are
  implied.</p>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-row-group">row group</dfn> is a set of
  <span title="concept-row">rows</span> anchored at a slot (0, <var
  title="">group<sub title="">y</sub></var>) with a particular <var
  title="">height</var> such that the row group covers all the slots
  with coordinates (<var title="">x</var>, <var title="">y</var>)
  where <span>0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var
  title="">x</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var title="">x<sub
  title="">width</sub></var></span> and <span><var
  title="">group<sub title="">y</sub></var>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var
  title="">y</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var title="">group<sub
  title="">y</sub></var>+<var title="">height</var></span>. Row groups
  correspond to <code>tbody</code>, <code>thead</code>, and
  <code>tfoot</code> elements. Not every row is necessarily in a row
  group.</p>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-column-group">column group</dfn> is a set
  of <span title="concept-column">columns</span> anchored at a slot
  (<var title="">group<sub title="">x</sub></var>, 0) with a
  particular <var title="">width</var> such that the column group
  covers all the slots with coordinates (<var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>) where <span><var title="">group<sub
  title="">x</sub></var>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var
  title="">x</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var title="">group<sub
  title="">x</sub></var>+<var title="">width</var></span> and
  <span>0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var title="">y</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var
  title="">y<sub title="">height</sub></var></span>. Column groups
  correspond to <code>colgroup</code> elements. Not every column is
  necessarily in a column group.</p>

  <p><span title="concept-row-group">Row groups</span> cannot overlap
  each other. Similarly, <span title="concept-column-group">column
  groups</span> cannot overlap each other.</p>

  <p>A <span title="concept-cell">cell</span> cannot cover slots that
  are from two or more <span title="concept-row-group">row
  groups</span>. It is, however, possible for a cell to be in multiple
  <span title="concept-column-group">column groups</span>. All the
  slots that form part of one cell are part of zero or one <span
  title="concept-row-group">row groups</span> and zero or more <span
  title="concept-column-group">column groups</span>.</p>

  <p>In addition to <span title="concept-cell">cells</span>, <span
  title="concept-column">columns</span>, <span
  title="concept-row">rows</span>, <span title="concept-row-group">row
  groups</span>, and <span title="concept-column-group">column
  groups</span>, <span title="concept-table">tables</span> can have a
  <code>caption</code> element associated with them. This gives the
  table a heading, or legend.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>table model error</dfn> is an error with the data
  represented by <code>table</code> elements and their
  descendants. Documents must not have table model errors.</p>


  <h5>Forming a table</h5>

  <p>To determine which elements correspond to which slots in a <span
  title="concept-table">table</span> associated with a
  <code>table</code> element, to determine the dimensions of the table
  (<var title="">x<sub title="">width</sub></var> and <var
  title="">y<sub title="">height</sub></var>), and to determine if
  there are any <span title="table model error">table model
  errors</span>, user agents must use the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>
    <p>Let <var title="">x<sub title="">width</sub></var> be zero.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>Let <var title="">y<sub title="">height</sub></var> be zero.</p>
   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">pending <code>tfoot</code> elements</var> be
    a list of <code>tfoot</code> elements, initially empty.</p>

   </li>

   <li>
    <p>Let <var title="">the table</var> be the <span
    title="concept-table">table</span> represented by the
    <code>table</code> element. The <var title="">x<sub
    title="">width</sub></var> and <var title="">y<sub
    title="">height</sub></var> variables give <var title="">the
    table</var>'s dimensions. <var title="">The table</var> is
    initially empty.</p>
   </li>

   <li>

    <!-- this step is here just so that we can be sure to have a first
    element in the next step, so that we can set up the "advance"
    exception-handling thingy below; otherwise it'd be more
    complicated. it's not a perf optimization per se. -->

    <p>If the <code>table</code> element has no children elements,
    then return <var title="">the table</var> (which will be empty),
    and abort these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Associate the first <code>caption</code> element child of the
    <code>table</code> element with <var title="">the table</var>. If
    there are no such children, then it has no associated
    <code>caption</code> element.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let the <var title="">current element</var> be the first
    element child of the <code>table</code> element.</p>

    <p>If a step in this algorithm ever requires the <var
    title="">current element</var> to be <dfn
    title="concept-table-advance">advanced to the next child of the
    <code>table</code></dfn> when there is no such next child, then
    the user agent must jump to the step labeled <i>end</i>, near the
    end of this algorithm.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>While the <var title="">current element</var> is not one of the
    following elements, <span
    title="concept-table-advance">advance</span> the <var
    title="">current element</var> to the next child of the

  <h3 id="forms">Forms</h3>

  <p>Forms allow unscripted client-server interaction: given a form, a
  user can provide data, submit it to the server, and have the server
  act on it accordingly (e.g. returning the results of a search or
  calculation). The elements used in forms can also be used for user
  interaction with no associated submission mechanism, in conjunction
  with scripts.</p>

  <p>Mostly for historical reasons, elements in this section fall into
  several overlapping (but subtly different) categories in addition to
  the usual ones like <span>flow content</span>, <span>phrasing
  content</span>, and <span>interactive content</span>.</p>

  <p>A number of the elements are <dfn title="form-associated
  element">form-associated elements</dfn>, which means they can have a
  <span>form owner</span> and, to expose this, have a <code
  title="attr-fae-form">form</code> content attribute with a matching
  <code title="dom-fae-form">form</code> DOM attribute.</p>

  <p>The <span title="form-associated element">form-associated
  elements</span> fall into several subcategories:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="category-submit">Submittable elements</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Denotes elements that can be used for <a
   href="#constructing-form-data-set">constructing the form data
   set</a> when a <code>form</code> element is <span
   title="concept-form-submit">submitted</span>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="category-reset">Resettable elements</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Denotes elements that can be affected when a <code>form</code>
   element is <span title="concept-form-reset">reset</span>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="category-listed">Listed</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Denotes elements that are listed in the <code
   title="dom-form-elements"><var title="">form</var>.elements</code>
   and <code title="dom-fieldset-elements"><var
   title="">fieldset</var>.elements</code> APIs.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="category-label">Labelable</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Denotes elements that can be associated with <code>label</code>
   elements.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>In addition, some <span title="category-submit">submittable
  elements</span> can be, depending on their attributes, <dfn
  title="concept-button">buttons</dfn>. The prose below defines when
  an element is a button. Some buttons are specifically <dfn
  title="concept-submit-button">submit buttons</dfn>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>object</code> element is also a
  <span>form-associated element</span> and can, with the use of a
  suitable <span>plugin</span>, partake in <span>form
  submission</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code>form</code> element <span>represents</span> a

  elements</span>, some of which can represent editable values that
  can be submitted to a server for processing.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-form-accept-charset"><code>accept-charset</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the character encodings that are to be used for the
  submission. If specified, the value must be an <span>ordered set of
  unique space-separated tokens</span>, and each token must be the
  preferred name of an <span>ASCII-compatible character
  encoding</span>. <a href="#refsIANACHARSET">[IANACHARSET]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-form-name"><code>name</code></dfn> attribute

  empty string, and the value must be unique amongst the
  <code>form</code> elements in the <code
  title="dom-forms">forms</code> collection that it is in, if any.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-form-autocomplete"><code>autocomplete</code></dfn>
  attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span>. The attribute has
  two states. The <code title="attr-form-autocomplete-on">on</code>
  keyword maps to the <dfn

  <code title="attr-form-autocomplete-off">off</code> keyword maps to
  the <dfn title="attr-form-autocomplete-off-state">off</dfn>
  state. The attribute may also be omitted. The <i>missing value
  default</i> is the <span
  title="attr-form-autocomplete-on-state">on</span> state. The <span
  title="attr-form-autocomplete-off-state">off</span> state indicates
  that by default, <code>input</code> elements in the form will have
  their <span>resulting autocompletion state</span> set to <i
  title="">off</i>; the <span
  title="attr-form-autocomplete-on-state">on</span> state indicates

  <p>The <dfn

  title="attr-form-accept-charset">accept-charset</code> content
  attribute.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-form-elements"><code>elements</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must return an <code>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code>
  rooted at the <code>Document</code> node, whose filter matches <span

  <p>The

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-form-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the value
  returned by the method of the same name on the <code
  title="dom-form-elements">elements</code> collection, when invoked
  with the same argument.</p>

  <p>Each <code>form</code> element has a mapping of names to elements
  called the <dfn>past names map</dfn>. It is used to persist names of
  controls even when they change names.</p>

  <p>The <span>names of the supported named properties</span> are the
  union of the names currently supported by the object returned by the
  <code title="dom-form-elements">elements</code> attribute, and the
  names currently in the <span>past names map</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-form-namedItem"><code>namedItem(<var

  following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">name</var> is one of the <span>names of the
    supported named properties</span> of the object returned by the
    <code title="dom-form-elements">elements</code> attribute, then
    run these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var title="">candidate</var> be the object returned
     by the <code
     title="dom-HTMLFormControlsCollection-namedItem">namedItem()</code>
     method on the object returned by the <code
     title="dom-form-elements">elements</code> attribute when passed
     the <var title="">name</var> argument.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var title="">candidate</var> is an element, then add a
     mapping from <var title="">name</var> to <var
     title="">candidate</var> in the <code>form</code> element's
     <span>past names map</span>, replacing the previous entry with
     the same name, if any.</p></li>

     <li><p>Return <var title="">candidate</var> and abort these
     steps.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, <var title="">name</var> is the name of one of
   the entries in the <code>form</code> element's <span>past names
   map</span>: return the object associated with <var
   title="">name</var> in that map.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>If an element listed in the <code>form</code> element's <span>past
  names map</span> is removed from the <code>Document</code>, then its
  entries must be removed from the map.</p>

  <!--
    This ridiculous setup is intended to do as much of the right thing
    while still supporting code written to work in IE7. IE versions
    prior to IE8 do not update the names on the <form> element
    collection to match new names when elements are renamed, and there
    are enough pages that rename elements and then access them by
    their old name that we have to support this.

    But we still want to expose them using the new names, so as far as
    possible we pretend the legacy names aren't there except if
    there's no other element actually named that way.

    Removing the element did remove the legacy name in IE7:
    http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E...%3Cform%20action%3D%22%2F%22%3E%3Cinput%20name%3Dsubmit%3E%3C%2Fform%3E%0A%3Cscript%3E%0A%20w(document.forms%5B0%5D.submit)%3B%0A%20w(document.forms%5B0%5D.removeChild(document.getElementsByTagName('input')%5B0%5D))%3B%0A%20w(document.forms%5B0%5D.length)%3B%0A%20try%20%7B%20document.forms%5B0%5D.submit()%3B%20%7D%20catch%20(e)%20%20%7B%20w(e.message)%20%7D%0A%3C%2Fscript%3E

    There's no interop on what happens when the name was originally a
    duplicate name, so we don't persist such accesses - at the time
    of writing, Safari returned the first element, Firefox returned
    null (as we do), and IE7 returned the original collection:
    http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E...%3Cform%20action%3D%22%2F%22%3E%3Cinput%20name%3Da%20id%3Dfirst%3E%3Cinput%20name%3Da%20id%3Dsecond%3E%3C%2Fform%3E%0A%3Cscript%3E%0A%20w%28document.forms[0].a%29%3B%0A%20document.getElementsByTagName%28%27input%27%29[0].name%20%3D%20%27b%27%3B%0A%20document.getElementsByTagName%28%27input%27%29[1].name%20%3D%20%27b%27%3B%0A%20w%28document.forms[0].length%29%3B%0A%20w%28document.forms[0].a.id%29%3B%0A%3C%2Fscript%3E

  <p>The <code>label</code> <span>represents</span> a caption in a user
  interface. The caption can be associated with a specific form
  control, known as the <code>label</code> element's <dfn>labeled
  control</dfn>.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified by the following rules, a
  <code>label</code> element has no <span>labeled control</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-label-for"><code>for</code></dfn> attribute
  may be specified to indicate a form control with which the caption
  is to be associated. If the attribute is specified, the attribute's
  value must be the ID of a <span title="category-label">labelable
  form-associated element</span> in the same <code>Document</code> as
  the <code>label</code> element. If the attribute is specified and
  there is an element in the <code>Document</code> whose ID is equal
  to the value of the <code title="attr-label-for">for</code>
  attribute, and the first such element is a <span
  title="category-label">labelable form-associated element</span>,
  then that element is the <code>label</code> element's <span>labeled
  control</span>.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-label-for">for</code> attribute is not
  specified, but the <code>label</code> element has a <span>labelable
  form-associated element</span> descendant, then the first such
  descendant in <span>tree order</span> is the <code>label</code>
  element's <span>labeled control</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code>label</code> element's exact default presentation and
  behavior, in particular what its <span>activation behavior</span>
  might be, if anything, should match the platform's label
  behavior.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, on platforms where clicking a checkbox label checks
   the checkbox, clicking the <code>label</code> in the following
   snippet could trigger the user agent to <span>run synthetic click
   activation steps</span> on the <code>input</code> element, as if
   the element itself had been triggered by the user:</p>

   <pre>&lt;label>&lt;input type=checkbox name=lost> Lost&lt;/label></pre>

   <p>On other platforms, the behavior might be just to focus the
   control, or do nothing.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <code title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute is used to
  explicitly associate the <code>label</code> element with its
  <span>form owner</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-label-htmlFor"><code>htmlFor</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-label-for">for</code> content attribute.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-label-control"><code>control</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return the <code>label</code> element's <span>labeled
  control</span>, if any, or null if there isn't one.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><span title="category-label">Labelable form-associated
  elements</span> have a <code>NodeList</code> object associated with
  them that represents the list of <code>label</code> elements, in
  <span>tree order</span>, whose <span>labeled control</span> is the
  element in question. The <dfn
  title="dom-lfe-labels"><code>labels</code></dfn> DOM attribute of
  <span title="category-label">labelable form-associated
  elements</span>, on getting, must return that <code>NodeList</code>
  object.</p>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element's <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute changes state, and
  when the element is first created, the element's rendering and
  behaviour must change to the new state's accordingly and the
  <dfn>value sanitization algorithm</dfn>, if one is defined for the
  <code title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's new state,
  must be invoked.</p>

  <p>Each <code>input</code> element has a <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span>, which is exposed by the <code
  title="dom-input-value">value</code> DOM attribute. Some states
  define an <dfn title="concept-input-value-string-number">algorithm
  to convert a string to a number</dfn>, an <dfn
  title="concept-input-value-number-string">algorithm to convert a
  number to a string</dfn>, an <dfn
  title="concept-input-value-string-date">algorithm to convert a
  string to a <code>Date</code> object</dfn>, and an <dfn
  title="concept-input-value-date-string">algorithm to convert a
  <code>Date</code> object to a string</dfn>, which are used by
  <code title="attr-input-max">max</code>,
  <code title="attr-input-min">min</code>,
  <code title="attr-input-step">step</code>,
  <code title="dom-input-valueAsDate">valueAsDate</code>,
  <code title="dom-input-valueAsNumber">valueAsNumber</code>,
  <code title="dom-input-stepDown">stepDown()</code>, and
  <code title="dom-input-stepUp">stepUp()</code>.</p>

  <p>Each <code>input</code> element has a boolean <dfn
  title="concept-input-value-dirty-flag">dirty value flag</dfn>. When
  it is true, the element is said to have a <dfn
  title="concept-input-value-dirty"><i>dirty value</i></dfn>. The
  <span title="concept-input-value-dirty-flag">dirty value flag</span>
  must be initially set to false when the element is created, and must
  be set to true whenever the user interacts with the control in a way
  that changes the <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-value"><code>value</code></dfn>
  content attribute gives the default <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> of the <code>input</code>
  element. When the <code title="attr-input-value">value</code>
  content attribute is added, set, or removed, if the control does not
  have a <i title="concept-input-value-dirty">dirty value</i>, the
  user agent must set the <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span>
  of the element to the value of the <code
  title="attr-input-value">value</code> content attribute, if there is
  one, or the empty string otherwise, and then run the current
  <span>value sanitization algorithm</span>, if one is defined.</p>

  <p>Each <code>input</code> element has a <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span>, which is exposed by
  the <code title="dom-input-checked">checked</code> DOM
  attribute.</p>

  <p>Each <code>input</code> element has a boolean <dfn
  title="concept-input-checked-dirty-flag">dirty checkedness
  flag</dfn>. When it is true, the element is said to have a <dfn
  title="concept-input-checked-dirty"><i>dirty
  checkedness</i></dfn>. The <span
  title="concept-input-checked-dirty-flag">dirty checkedness
  flag</span> must be initially set to false when the element is
  created, and must be set to true whenever the user interacts with
  the control in a way that changes the <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-checked"><code>checked</code></dfn>
  content attribute gives the default <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span> of the
  <code>input</code> element. When the <code
  title="attr-input-checked">checked</code> content attribute is
  added, if the control does not have <i
  title="concept-input-checked-dirty">dirty checkedness</i>, the user
  agent must set the <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span> of the element to
  true; when the <code title="attr-input-checked">checked</code>
  content attribute is removed, if the control does not have <i
  title="concept-input-checked-dirty">dirty checkedness</i>, the user
  agent must set the <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span> of the element to
  false.</p>

  <p>The <span title="concept-form-reset-control">reset
  algorithm</span> for <code>input</code> elements is to set the <span
  title="concept-input-value-dirty-flag">dirty value flag</span> and
  <span title="concept-input-checked-dirty-flag">dirty checkedness
  flag</span> back to false, set the <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> of the element to the value of
  the <code title="attr-input-value">value</code> content attribute,
  if there is one, or the empty string otherwise, set the <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span> of the element to true
  if the element has a <code title="attr-input-checked">checked</code>
  content attribute and false if it does not, and then invoke the
  <span>value sanitization algorithm</span>, if the <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's current state
  defines one.</p>

  <p>Each <code>input</code> element has a boolean <dfn
  title="concept-input-mutability">mutability flag</dfn>. When it is
  true, the element is said to be <dfn
  title="concept-input-mutable"><i>mutable</i></dfn>, and when it is
  false the element is <dfn
  title="concept-input-immutable"><i>immutable</i></dfn>. Unless
  otherwise specified, an <code>input</code> element is always <i
  title="concept-input-mutable">mutable</i>. Unless otherwise
  specified, the user agent should not allow the user to modify the
  element's <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span> or <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span>.</p>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element is <span
  title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>, it is <i
  title="concept-input-immutable">immutable</i>.</p>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element does not have a
  <code>Document</code> node as one of its ancestors (i.e. when it is
  not in the document), it is <i
  title="concept-input-immutable">immutable</i>.</p> <!-- XXX how does
  this affect shadow trees in XBL2? -->

  <p class="note">The <code
  title="attr-input-readonly">readonly</code> attribute can also in
  some cases (e.g. for the <span
  title="attr-input-type-date">Date</span> state, but not the <span
  title="attr-input-type-checkbox">Checkbox</span> state) make an
  <code>input</code> element <i
  title="concept-input-immutable">immutable</i>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute is used to
  explicitly associate the <code>input</code> element with its
  <span>form owner</span>. The <code title="attr-fe-name">name</code>
  attribute represents the element's name. The <code
  title="attr-fe-disabled">disabled</code> attribute is used to make
  the control non-interactive and to prevent its value from being
  submitted. The <code title="attr-fe-autofocus">autofocus</code>
  attribute controls focus.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-input-indeterminate"><code>indeterminate</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must initially be set to false. On getting, it must return

  <h6><dfn title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</dfn> state</h6>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element's <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state, the rules
  in this section apply.</p>

  <p>The <code>input</code> element <span>represents</span> either an image from
  which a user can select a coordinate and submit the form, or
  alternatively a button from which the user can submit the form. The
  element is a <span title="concept-button">button</span>,
  specifically a <span title="concept-submit-button">submit
  button</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The image is given by the <dfn
  title="attr-input-src"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute. The <code
  title="attr-input-src">src</code> attribute must be present, and
  must contain a <span>valid URL</span> referencing a non-interactive,
  optionally animated, image resource that is neither paged nor
  scripted.</p>

  <p>When any of the following events occur, unless the user agent
  cannot support images, or its support for images has been disabled,
  or the user agent only fetches elements on demand, the user agent
  must <span title="resolve a url">resolve</span> the value of the
  <code title="attr-input-src">src</code> attribute, relative to the
  element, and if that is successful, must <span>fetch</span> the
  resulting <span>absolute URL</span>:</p> <!-- Note how this does NOT
  happen when the base URL changes. -->

  <ul>

   <li>The <code>input</code> element's <code
   title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is first set to the
   <span title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state
   (possibly when the element is first created), and the <code
   title="attr-input-src">src</code> attribute is present.</li>

   <li>The <code>input</code> element's <code
   title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is changed back to
   the <span title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state,
   and the <code title="attr-input-src">src</code> attribute is
   present, and its value has changed since the last time the <code
   title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute was in the <span
   title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state.</li>

   <li>The <code>input</code> element's <code
   title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
   title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state, and the
   <code title="attr-input-src">src</code> attribute is set or
   changed.</li> <!-- XXX define changed -->

  </ul>

  <p>Fetching the image must <span>delay the <code
  title="event-load">load</code> event</span>.</p>

  <p>If the image was successfully obtained, with no network errors,
  and the image's type is a supported image type, and the image is a
  valid image of that type, then the image is said to be
  <i>available</i>. If this is true before the image is completely
  downloaded, each <span title="concept-task">task</span> that is
  <span title="queue a task">queued</span> by the <span>networking
  task source</span> while the image is being <span
  title="fetch">fetched</span> must update the presentation of the
  image appropriately.</p>

  <p>The user agents should apply the <span title="Content-Type
  sniffing: image">image sniffing rules</span> to determine the type
  of the image, with the image's <span title="Content-Type">associated
  Content-Type headers</span> giving the <var title="">official
  type</var>. If these rules are not applied, then the type of the
  image must be the type given by the image's <span
  title="Content-Type">associated Content-Type headers</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents must not support non-image resources with the
  <code>input</code> element. User agents must not run executable code
  embedded in the image resource. User agents must only display the
  first page of a multipage resource. User agents must not allow the
  resource to act in an interactive fashion, but should honour any
  animation in the resource.</p>

  <p>The <span title="concept-task">task</span> that is <span
  title="queue a task">queued</span> by the <span>networking task
  source</span> once the resource has been <span
  title="fetch">fetched</span>, must, if the download was successful
  and the image is <i>available</i>, <span>queue a task</span> to
  <span>fire a <code title="event-load">load</code> event</span> on
  the <code>input</code> element; and otherwise, if the fetching
  process fails without a response from the remote server, or
  completes but the image is not a valid or supported image,
  <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire an <code
  title="event-error">error</code> event</span> on the
  <code>input</code> element.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-alt"><code>alt</code></dfn> attribute
  provides the textual label for the alternative button for users and
  user agents who cannot use the image. The <code
  title="attr-input-alt">alt</code> attribute must also be present,
  and must contain a non-empty string.</p>

  <p>The <code>input</code> element supports <span>dimension
  attributes</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-input-src">src</code> attribute is set,
  and the image is <i>available</i> and the user agent is configured
  to display that image, then: The element <span>represents</span> a control for
  selecting a <span
  title="concept-input-type-image-coordinate">coordinate</span> from
  the image specified by the <code title="attr-input-src">src</code>
  attribute; if the element is <i
  title="concept-input-mutable">mutable</i>, the user agent should
  allow the user to select this <span
  title="concept-input-type-image-coordinate">coordinate</span>. The
  <span>activation behavior</span> in this case consists of taking the
  user's selected <span
  title="concept-input-type-image-coordinate">coordinate</span>, and
  then, if the element has a <span>form owner</span>, <span
  title="concept-form-submit">submitting</span> the <code>input</code>
  element's <span>form owner</span> from the <code>input</code>
  element. If the user activates the control without explicitly
  selecting a coordinate, then the coordinate (0,0) must be
  assumed.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the element <span>represents</span> a submit button whose label is
  given by the value of the <code title="attr-input-alt">alt</code>
  attribute; if the element is <i
  title="concept-input-mutable">mutable</i>, the user agent should
  allow the user to activate the button. The <span>activation
  behavior</span> in this case consists of setting the <span
  title="concept-input-type-image-coordinate">selected
  coordinate</span> to (0,0), and then, if the element has a
  <span>form owner</span>, <span
  title="concept-form-submit">submitting</span> the <code>input</code>
  element's <span>form owner</span> from the <code>input</code>
  element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-input-type-image-coordinate">selected
  coordinate</dfn> must consist of an <var title="">x</var>-component
  and a <var title="">y</var>-component. The <var
  title="">x</var>-component must be greater than or equal to zero,
  and less than or equal to the rendered width, in CSS pixels, of the
  image, plus the widths of the left and right borders rendered around
  the image, if any. The <var title="">y</var>-component must be
  greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal to the
  rendered height, in CSS pixels, of the image, plus the widths of the
  top and bottom bordered rendered around the image, if any. The
  coordinates must be relative to the image's borders, where there are
  any, and the edge of the image otherwise.</p> <!-- legacy browser

  <h5>Common <code>input</code> element attributes</h5>

  <p>These attributes only apply to an <code>input</code> element if
  its <code title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in a
  state whose definition declares that the attribute applies. When an
  attribute doesn't apply to an <code>input</code> element, user
  agents must <span>ignore</span> the attribute.</p>


  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-autocomplete">autocomplete</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-input-autocomplete"><code>autocomplete</code></dfn>
  attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span>. The attribute has
  three states. The <code title="attr-input-autocomplete-on">on</code>
  keyword maps to the <dfn
  title="attr-input-autocomplete-on-state">on</dfn> state, and the
  <code title="attr-input-autocomplete-off">off</code> keyword maps to
  the <dfn title="attr-input-autocomplete-off-state">off</dfn>
  state. The attribute may also be omitted. The <i>missing value
  default</i> is the <dfn
  title="attr-input-autocomplete-default-state">default</dfn>
  state.</p>

  <p>The <span title="attr-input-autocomplete-off-state">off</span>
  state indicates that the control's input data is either particularly
  sensitive (for example the activation code for a nuclear weapon) or
  is a value that will never be reused (for example a one-time-key for
  a bank login) and the user will therefore have to explicitly enter
  the data each time, instead of being able to rely on the UA to
  prefill the value for him.</p>

  <p>Conversely, the <span
  title="attr-input-autocomplete-on-state">on</span> state indicates
  that the value is not particularly sensitive and the user can expect
  to be able to rely on his user agent to remember values he has
  entered for that control.</p>

  <p>The <span
  title="attr-input-autocomplete-default-state">default</span> state
  indicates that the user agent is to use the <code
  title="attr-form-autocomplete">autocomplete</code> attribute on the
  element's <span>form owner</span> instead.</p>

  <p>Each <code>input</code> element has a <dfn>resulting
  autocompletion state</dfn>, which is either <i title="">on</i> or <i
  title="">off</i>.</p>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element's <code
  title="attr-input-autocomplete">autocomplete</code> attribute is in
  the <span title="attr-input-autocomplete-on-state">on</span> state,
  when an <code>input</code> element's <code
  title="attr-input-autocomplete">autocomplete</code> attribute is in
  the <span
  title="attr-input-autocomplete-default-state">default</span> state,
  and the element has no <span>form owner</span>, and when an
  <code>input</code> element's <code
  title="attr-input-autocomplete">autocomplete</code> attribute is in
  the <span
  title="attr-input-autocomplete-default-state">default</span> state,
  and the element's <span>form owner</span>'s <code
  title="attr-form-autocomplete">autocomplete</code> attribute is in
  the <span title="attr-form-autocomplete-on-state">on</span> state,
  the <code>input</code> element's <span>resulting autocompletion
  state</span> is <i title="">on</i>. Otherwise, the
  <code>input</code> element's <span>resulting autocompletion
  state</span> is <i title="">off</i>.</p>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element's <span>resulting
  autocompletion state</span> is <i title="">on</i>, the user agent
  may store the value entered by the user so that if the user returns
  to the page, the UA can prefill the form. Otherwise, the user agent
  should not remember the control's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span>.</p>

  <p>The autocompletion mechanism must be implemented by the user
  agent acting as if the user had modified the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span>, and must be done at a time
  where the element is <i title="concept-input-mutable">mutable</i>
  (e.g. just after the element has been inserted into the document, or
  when the user agent <span title="stop parsing">stops
  parsing</span>).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Banks frequently do not want UAs to prefill login
   information:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Account: &lt;input type="text" name="ac" autocomplete="off">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PIN: &lt;input type="text" name="pin" autocomplete="off">&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <p>A user agent may allow the user to override the <span>resulting
  autocompletion state</span> and set it to always <i title="">on</i>,
  always allowing values to be remembered and prefilled), or always <i
  title="">off</i>, never remembering values. However, the ability to
  override the <span>resulting autocompletion state</span> to <i
  title="">on</i> should not be trivially accessible, as there are
  significant security implications for the user if all values are
  always remembered, regardless of the site's preferences.</p>



  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-list">list</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-list"><code>list</code></dfn>
  attribute is used to identify an element that lists predefined
  options suggested to the user.</p>

  <p>If present, its value must be the ID of a <code>datalist</code>
  element in the same document.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-input-list">suggestions source
  element</dfn> is the first element in the document in <span>tree
  order</span> to have an ID equal to the value of the <code
  title="attr-input-list">list</code> attribute, if that element is a
  <code>datalist</code> element. If there is no <code
  title="attr-input-list">list</code> attribute, or if there is no
  element with that ID, or if the first element with that ID is not a
  <code>datalist</code> element, then there is no <span
  title="concept-input-list">suggestions source element</span>.</p>

  <p>If there is a <span title="concept-input-list">suggestions source
  element</span>, then each <code>option</code> element that is a
  descendant of the <span title="concept-input-list">suggestions
  source element</span>, that is not <span
  title="concept-option-disabled">disabled</span>, and whose <span
  title="concept-option-value">value</span> is a string that isn't the
  empty string and that the user would be allowed to enter as the
  <code>input</code> element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span>, represents a suggestion. Each
  suggestion has a <span title="concept-option-value">value</span> and
  a <span title="concept-option-label">label</span>.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is allowing the user to edit the
  <code>input</code> element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span>, the user agent should offer
  the suggestions to the user in a manner suitable for the type of
  control used. The user agent may use the suggestion's <span
  title="concept-option-label">label</span> to identify the suggestion
  if appropriate. If the user selects a suggestion, then the
  <code>input</code> element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> must be set to the selected
  suggestion's <span title="concept-option-value">value</span>, as if
  the user had written that value himself.</p>

  <p>User agents should filter the suggestions to hide suggestions
  that would cause the element to not <span
  title="concept-fv-valid">satisfy its constraints</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-input-list">list</code> attribute does
  not apply, there is no <span title="concept-input-list">suggestions
  source element</span>.</p>


  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-readonly">readonly</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-readonly"><code>readonly</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>. When specified, the
  element is <i title="concept-input-immutable">immutable</i>.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> If the <code
  title="attr-input-readonly">readonly</code> attribute is specified
  on an <code>input</code> element, the element is <span>barred from
  constraint validation</span>.</p>



  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-size">size</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-size"><code>size</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the number of characters that, in a visual
  rendering, the user agent is to allow the user to see while editing
  the element's <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-input-size">size</code> attribute, if
  specified, must have a value that is a <span>valid non-negative
  integer</span> greater than zero.</p>

  <p>If the attribute is present, then its value must be parsed using
  the <span>rules for parsing non-negative integers</span>, and if the
  result is a number greater than zero, then the user agent should
  ensure that at least that many characters are visible.</p>

  <p class="XXX">The rendering section will define this in more
  detail.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-input-size">size</code> DOM attribute
  <span>limited to only positive non-zero numbers</span>.</p>



  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-required">required</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-required"><code>required</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>. When specified, the
  element is <dfn
  title="concept-input-required"><i>required</i></dfn>.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> If the element is <i
  title="concept-input-required">required</i>, and its <code
  title="dom-input-value">value</code> DOM attribute applies and is in
  the mode <span title="dom-input-value-value">value</span>, and the
  element is <i title="concept-input-mutable">mutable</i>, and the
  element's <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is the empty
  string, then the element is <span>suffering from being
  missing</span>.</p>



  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-multiple">multiple</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-multiple"><code>multiple</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span> that indicates whether
  the user is to be allowed to specify more than one value.</p>



  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-maxlength">maxlength</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-input-maxlength"><code>maxlength</code></dfn> attribute,
  when it applies, is a <span title="attr-fe-maxlength">form control
  <code title="">maxlength</code> attribute</span> controlled by the
  <code>input</code> element's <span
  title="concept-input-value-dirty-flag">dirty value flag</span>.</p>

  <p>If the <code>input</code> element has a <span>maximum allowed
  value length</span>, then the <span>codepoint length</span> of the
  value of the element's <code title="attr-input-value">value</code>
  attribute must be equal to or less than the element's <span>maximum
  allowed value length</span>.</p>



  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-pattern"><code>pattern</code></dfn>
  attribute specifies a regular expression against which the control's
  <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is to be checked.</p>

  <p>If specified, the attribute's value must match the <i
  title="">Pattern</i> production of ECMA 262's grammar. <a
  href="#refsECMA262">[ECMA262]</a></p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> If the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is not the empty string, and
  the element's <code title="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code>
  attribute is specified and the attribute's value, when compiled as
  an ECMA 262 regular expression with the <code
  title="">global</code>, <code title="">ignoreCase</code>, and <code
  title="">multiline</code> flags <em>disabled</em> (see ECMA 262,
  sections 15.10.7.2 through 15.10.7.4), compiles successfully but the
  resulting regular expression does not match the entirety of the
  element's <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span>, then the
  element is <span>suffering from a pattern mismatch</span>. <a
  href="#refsECMA262">[ECMA262]</a></p>

  <p class="note">This implies that the regular expression language
  used for this attribute is the same as that defined in ECMA 262,
  except that the <code title="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code>
  attribute must match the entire value, not just any subset (somewhat
  as if it implied a <code title="">^(?:</code> at the start of the
  pattern and a <code title="">)$</code> at the end).</p>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element has a <code
  title="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code> attribute specified,
  authors should include a <code title="attr-title">title</code>
  attribute to give a description of the pattern. User agents may use
  the contents of this attribute, if it is present, when informing the
  user that the pattern is not matched, or at any other suitable time,
  such as in a tooltip or read out by assistive technology when the
  control gains focus.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, the following snippet:</p>
   <pre>
&lt;label&gt; Part number:
 &lt;input pattern="[0-9][A-Z]{3}" name="part"
        title="A part number is a digit followed by three uppercase letters."/&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
</pre>
   <p>...could cause the UA to display an alert such as:</p>
   <pre><samp> part number is a digit followed by three uppercase letters.
You cannot complete this form until the field is correct.</samp></pre>
  </div>

  <p>When a control has a <code>pattern</code> attribute, the
  <code>title</code> attribute, if used, must describe the pattern.
  Additional information could also be included, so long as it assists
  the user in filling in the control. Otherwise, assistive technology
  would be impaired.</p>

  <p class="example">For instance, if the title attribute contained
  the caption of the control, assistive technology could end up saying
  something like <samp>The text you have entered does not match the
  required pattern. Birthday</samp>, which is not useful.</p>

  <p>UAs may still show the <code>title</code> in non-error situations
  (for example, as a tooltip when hovering over the control), so
  authors should be careful not to word <code>title</code>s as if an
  error has necessarily occurred.</p>



  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-min">min</code> and <code
  title="attr-input-max">max</code> attributes</h6>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-min"><code>min</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="attr-input-max"><code>max</code></dfn> attributes indicate
  the allowed range of values for the element.</p>

  <p>Their syntax is defined by the section that defines the <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's current state.</p>

  <p>If the element has a <code title="attr-input-min">min</code>
  attribute, and the result of applying the <span
  title="concept-input-value-string-number">algorithm to convert a
  string to a number</span> to the value of the <code
  title="attr-input-min">min</code> attribute is a a number, then that
  number is the element's <dfn
  title="concept-input-min">minimum</dfn>; otherwise, if the the <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's current state
  defines a <dfn title="concept-input-min-default">default
  minimum</dfn>, then that is the <span
  title="concept-input-min">minimum</span>; otherwise, the element has
  no <span title="concept-input-min">minimum</span>.)</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> When the element has a
  <span title="attr-input-min">minimum</span>, and the result of
  applying the <span
  title="concept-input-value-string-number">algorithm to convert a
  string to a number</span> to the string given by the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is a number, and the number
  obtained from that algorithm is less than the <span
  title="attr-input-min">minimum</span>, the element is
  <span>suffering from an underflow</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-input-min">min</code> attribute also
  defines the <span title="concept-input-min-zero">step
  base</span>.</p>

  <p>If the element has a <code title="attr-input-max">max</code>
  attribute, and the result of applying the <span
  title="concept-input-value-string-number">algorithm to convert a
  string to a number</span> to the value of the <code
  title="attr-input-max">max</code> attribute is a a number, then that
  number is the element's <dfn
  title="concept-input-max">maximum</dfn>; otherwise, if the the <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's current state
  defines a <dfn title="concept-input-max-default">default
  maximum</dfn>, then that is the <span
  title="concept-input-max">maximum</span>; otherwise, the element has
  no <span title="concept-input-max">maximum</span>.)</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> When the element has a
  <span title="attr-input-max">maximum</span>, and the result of
  applying the <span
  title="concept-input-value-string-number">algorithm to convert a

  obtained from that algorithm is more than the <span
  title="attr-input-max">maximum</span>, the element is
  <span>suffering from an overflow</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-input-max">max</code> attribute's value
  (the <span title="concept-input-max">maximum</span>) must not be
  less than the <code title="attr-input-min">min</code> attribute's
  value (its <span title="concept-input-min">minimum</span>).</p>

  <p class="note">If an element has a <span
  title="attr-input-max">maximum</span> that is less than its <span
  title="attr-input-min">minimum</span>, then so long as the element
  has a <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span>, it will either be
  <span>suffering from an underflow</span> or <span>suffering from an
  overflow</span>.</p>


  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-step">step</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-input-step"><code>step</code></dfn>
  attribute indicates the granularity that is expected (and required)
  of the <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span>, by limiting
  the allowed values. The section that defines the <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's current state also
  defines the <dfn title="concept-input-step-default">default
  step</dfn> and the <dfn title="concept-input-step-scale">step
  scale factor</dfn>, which are used in processing the attribute as
  described below.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-input-step">step</code> attribute, if
  specified, must either have a value that is a <span>valid floating
  point number</span> that <span title="rules for parsing floating
  point number values">parses</span> to a number that is greater than
  zero, or must have a value that is an <span>ASCII
  case-insensitive</span> match for the string "<code
  title="">any</code>".</p>

  <p>The attribute provides the <dfn
  title="concept-input-step">allowed value step</dfn> for the element,
  as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the attribute is absent, then the <span
   title="concept-input-step">allowed value step</span> is the <span
   title="concept-input-step-default">default step</span> multiplied
   by the <span title="concept-input-step-scale">step scale
   factor</span>.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the attribute's value is an <span>ASCII
   case-insensitive</span> match for the string "<code
   title="">any</code>", then there is no <span
   title="concept-input-step">allowed value step</span>.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the <span>rules for parsing floating point number
   values</span>, when they are applied to the attribute's value,
   return an error, zero, or a number less than zero, then the <span
   title="concept-input-step">allowed value step</span> is the <span
   title="concept-input-step-default">default step</span> multiplied
   by the <span title="concept-input-step-scale">step scale
   factor</span>.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, the <span title="concept-input-step">allowed value
   step</span> is the number returned by the <span>rules for parsing
   floating point number values</span> when they are applied to the
   attribute's value, multiplied by the <span
   title="concept-input-step-scale">step scale factor</span>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-input-min-zero">step base</dfn> is the
  result of applying the <span
  title="concept-input-value-string-number">algorithm to convert a
  string to a number</span> to the value of the <code
  title="attr-input-min">min</code> attribute, unless the element does
  not have a <code title="attr-input-min">min</code> attribute
  specified or the result of applying that algorithm is an error, in
  which case the <span title="concept-input-min-zero">step base</span>
  is zero.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> When the element has an
  <span title="concept-input-step">allowed value step</span>, and the
  result of applying the <span
  title="concept-input-value-string-number">algorithm to convert a
  string to a number</span> to the string given by the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is a number, and that
  number subtracted from the <span title="concept-input-min-zero">step
  base</span> is not an integral multiple of the <span
  title="concept-input-step">allowed value step</span>, the element is
  <span>suffering from a step mismatch</span>.</p>



  <h6>The <code title="attr-input-placeholder">placeholder</code> attribute</h6>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-input-placeholder"><code>placeholder</code></dfn>
  attribute represents a <em>short</em> hint (a word or short phrase)
  intended to aid the user with data entry. A hint could be a sample
  value or a brief description of the expected format. The attribute,
  if specified, must have a value that contains no U+000A LINE FEED
  (LF) or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters.</p>

  <p class="note">For a longer hint or other advisory text, the <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute is more appropriate.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-input-placeholder">placeholder</code>
  attribute should not be used as an alternative to a
  <code>label</code>.</p>

  <p>User agents should present this hint to the user, after having
  <span title="strip line breaks">stripped line breaks</span> from it,
  when the element's <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is
  the empty string and the control is not focused (e.g. by displaying
  it inside a blank unfocused control).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here is an example of a mail configuration user interface that
   uses the <code title="attr-input-placeholder">placeholder</code>
   attribute:</p>

   <pre>&lt;fieldset>
 &lt;legend>Mail Account&lt;/legend>
 &lt;p>&lt;label>Name: &lt;input type="text" name="fullname" placeholder="John Ratzenberger">&lt;/label>&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>&lt;label>Address: &lt;input type="email" name="address" placeholder="john@example.net">&lt;/label>&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>&lt;label>Password: &lt;input type="password" name="password">&lt;/label>&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>&lt;label>Description: &lt;input type="text" name="desc" placeholder="My Email Account">&lt;/label>&lt;/p>
&lt;/fieldset></pre>

  <h5>Common <code>input</code> element APIs</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-input-value"><code>value</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute allows scripts to manipulate the <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> of an <code>input</code>
  element. If the attribute applies, then it is in one of the
  following modes, which define its behavior:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-input-value-value">value</dfn>

   <dd>On getting, it must return the current <span
   title="concept-fe-value">value</span> of the element. On setting,
   it must set the element's <span
   title="concept-fe-value">value</span> to the new value, set the
   element's <span title="concept-input-value-dirty-flag">dirty value
   flag</span> to true, and then invoke the <span>value sanitization
   algorithm</span>, if the element's <code
   title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's current state
   defines one.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-input-value-default">default</dfn>

   <dd>On getting, if the element has a <code
   title="attr-input-value">value</code> attribute, it must return
   that attribute's value; otherwise, it must return the empty
   string. On setting, it must set the element's <code
   title="attr-input-value">value</code> attribute to the new
   value.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-input-value-default-on">default/on</dfn>

   <dd>On getting, if the element has a <code
   title="attr-input-value">value</code> attribute, it must return
   that attribute's value; otherwise, it must return the string "<code
   title="">on</code>". On setting, it must set the element's <code
   title="attr-input-value">value</code> attribute to the new
   value.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>If the attribute does not apply, then on getting and setting it
  must throw an <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-input-checked"><code>checked</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute allows scripts to manipulate the <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span> of an
  <code>input</code> element. On getting, it must return the current
  <span title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span> of the element;
  and on setting, it must set the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span> to the new value and
  set the element's <span
  title="concept-input-checked-dirty-flag">dirty checkedness
  flag</span> to true.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-input-valueAsDate"><code>valueAsDate</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute represents the <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> of the element, interpreted
  as a date.</p>

  <p>On getting, if the <code
  title="dom-input-valueAsDate">valueAsDate</code> attribute does not
  apply, as defined for the <code>input</code> element's <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's current state, then
  return null. Otherwise, run the <span
  title="concept-input-value-string-date">algorithm to convert a
  string to a <code>Date</code> object</span> defined for that state;
  if the algorithm returned a <code>Date</code> object, then return
  it, otherwise, return null.</p>

  <p>On setting, if the <code
  title="dom-input-valueAsDate">valueAsDate</code> attribute does not
  apply, as defined for the <code>input</code> element's <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's current state, then
  throw an <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception; otherwise, if
  the new value is null, then set the <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> of the element to the empty
  string; otherwise, run the <span
  title="concept-input-value-date-string">algorithm to convert a
  <code>Date</code> object to a string</span>, as defined for that
  state, on the new value, and set the <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> of the element to resulting
  string.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-input-valueAsNumber"><code>valueAsNumber</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute represents the <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-input-list"><code>list</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return the current <span
  title="concept-input-list">suggestions source element</span>, if
  any, or null otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-input-selectedOption"><code>selectedOption</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must return the first <code>option</code> element, in
  <span>tree order</span>, to be a child of the <span

  whose <span title="concept-option-value">value</span> matches the
  <code>input</code> element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span>, if any. If there is no <span
  title="concept-input-list">suggestions source element</span>, or if
  it contains no matching <code>option</code> element, then the <code
  title="dom-input-selectedOption">selectedOption</code> attribute
  must return null.</p>


  <h5>Common event behaviors</h5>

  <p>When the <dfn title="event-input-input"><code>input</code></dfn>
  event applies, any time the user causes the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> to change, the user agent must
  <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple event</span> called
  <code title="event-input">input</code> at the <code>input</code>
  element, then <span>broadcast <code
  title="event-forminput">forminput</code> events</span> at the
  <code>input</code> element's <span>form owner</span>. User agents
  may wait for a suitable break in the user's interaction before
  queuing the task; for example, a user agent could wait for the user
  to have not hit a key for 100ms, so as to only fire the event when
  the user pauses, instead of continuously for each keystroke.</p>
  <!-- same text is present in the <textarea> section -->

  <p class="example">Examples of a user changing the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> would include the user typing
  into a text field, pasting a new value into the field, or undoing an
  edit in that field. Some user interactions do not cause changes to
  the value, e.g. hitting the "delete" key in an empty text field, or
  replacing some text in the field with text from the clipboard that
  happens to be exactly the same text.</p>
  <!-- XXX consider putting the above example in a section that
  applies to "input" events for the <textarea> element too -->

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="event-input-change"><code>change</code></dfn> event applies,
  if the element does not have an <span>activation behavior</span>
  defined but uses a user interface that involves an explicit commit
  action, then any time the user commits a change to the element's
  <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span> or list of <span
  title="concept-input-type-file-selected">selected files</span>, the
  user agent must <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple
  event</span> called <code title="event-change">change</code> at the
  <code>input</code> element, then <span>broadcast <code
  title="event-formchange">formchange</code> events</span> at the
  <code>input</code> element's <span>form owner</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">An example of a user interface with a commit
  action would be a <span title="attr-input-type-file">File
  Upload</span> control that consists of a single button that brings
  up a file selection dialog: when the dialog is closed, if that the
  <span title="concept-input-type-file-selected">file selection</span>
  changed as a result, then the user has commited a new <span
  title="concept-input-type-file-selected">file selection</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">Another example of a user interface with a commit
  action would be a <span title="attr-input-type-date">Date</span>
  control that allows both text-based user input and user selection
  from a drop-down calendar: while text input might not have an
  explicit commit step, selecting a date from the drop down calendar
  and then dismissing the drop down would be a commit action.</p>

  <p>When the user agent changes the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> on behalf of the user (e.g. as
  part of a form prefilling feature), the user agent must follow these
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the <code title="event-input-input">input</code> event
   applies, <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple
   event</span> called <code title="event-input">input</code> at the
   <code>input</code> element.</li>

   <li>If the <code title="event-input-input">input</code> event
   applies, <span>broadcast <code
   title="event-forminput">forminput</code> events</span> at the
   <code>input</code> element's <span>form owner</span>.</li>

   <li>If the <code title="event-input-change">change</code> event
   applies, <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple
   event</span> called <code title="event-change">change</code> at the
   <code>input</code> element.</li>

   <li>If the <code title="event-input-change">change</code> event
   applies, <span>broadcast <code
   title="event-formchange">formchange</code> events</span> at the
   <code>input</code> element's <span>form owner</span>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">In addition, when the <code
  title="event-input-change">change</code> event applies, <code
  title="event-change">change</code> events can also be fired as part
  of the element's <span>activation behavior</span> and as part of the
  <span>unfocusing steps</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span>task source</span> for these <span
  title="concept-tasks">task</span> is the <span>user interaction task
  source</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code>button</code> element <span>represents</span> a button. If the
  element is not <span title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>,
  then the user agent should allow the user to activate the
  button.</p>

  <p>The element is a <span title="concept-button">button</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-button-type"><code>type</code></dfn>
  attribute controls the behavior of the button when it is activated.
  It is an <span>enumerated attribute</span>. The following table
  lists the keywords and states for the attribute &mdash; the keywords
  in the left column map to the states in the cell in the second
  column on the same row as the keyword.</p>

  <table>

  </table>

  <p>The <i>missing value default</i> is the <span
  title="attr-button-type-submit-state">Submit Button</span>
  state.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-button-type">type</code> attribute is in
  the <span title="attr-button-type-submit-state">Submit Button</span>
  state, the element is specifically a <span
  title="concept-submit-button">submit button</span>.</p>

  <p>If the element is not <span
  title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>, the <span>activation
  behavior</span> of the <code>button</code> element is to run the
  steps defined in the following list for the current state of the
  element's <code title="attr-button-type">type</code> attribute.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt> <dfn title="attr-button-type-submit-state">Submit Button</dfn> </dt>

  <p>The <code title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute is used to
  explicitly associate the <code>button</code> element with its
  <span>form owner</span>. The <code title="attr-fe-name">name</code>
  attribute represents the element's name. The <code
  title="attr-fe-disabled">disabled</code> attribute is used to make
  the control non-interactive and to prevent its value from being
  submitted. The <code title="attr-fe-autofocus">autofocus</code>
  attribute controls focus. The <code
  title="attr-fs-action">action</code>, <code
  title="attr-fs-enctype">enctype</code>, <code
  title="attr-fs-method">method</code>, <code

  for form submission</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-button-value"><code>value</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the element's value for the purposes of form
  submission. The <code title="attr-button-value">value</code>
  attribute must not be present unless the <code

  element's <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is the value
  of the element's <code title="attr-button-value">value</code>
  attribute, if there is one, or the empty string otherwise.</p>

  <p class="note">A button (and its value) is only included in the

  <p>The <code>select</code> element represents a control for
  selecting amongst a set of options.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-select-multiple"><code>multiple</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>. If the attribute is
  present, then the <code>select</code> element <span>represents</span> a control
  for selecting zero or more options from the <span
  title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</span>. If the
  attribute is absent, then the <code>select</code> element <span>represents</span>
  a control for selecting a single option from the <span
  title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</dfn>
  for a <code>select</code> element consists of all the
  <code>option</code> element children of the <code>select</code>
  element, and all the <code>option</code> element children of all the
  <code>optgroup</code> element children of the <code>select</code>
  element, in <span>tree order</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-select-size"><code>size</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the number of options to show to the user. The <code
  title="attr-input-size">size</code> attribute, if specified, must
  have a value that is a <span>valid non-negative integer</span>
  greater than zero. If the <code
  title="attr-select-multiple">multiple</code> attribute is present,
  then the <code title="attr-input-size">size</code> attribute's
  default value is 4. If the <code
  title="attr-select-multiple">multiple</code> attribute is absent,
  then the <code title="attr-input-size">size</code> attribute's
  default value is 1.</p>

  <!-- XXX for the rendering section
  <p>If the <code title="attr-select-multiple">multiple</code>
  attribute is absent, and either the <code
  title="attr-input-size">size</code> attribute is also absent or
  parsing its value using the <span>rules for parsing non-negative
  integers</span> returns 1, 0, or an error, then the control should
  be rendered as a drop-down select box. Otherwise, it should be
  rendered as a list select box.</p>
  -->

  <p>If the <code title="attr-select-multiple">multiple</code>
  attribute is absent, and the element is not <span
  title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>, then the user agent
  should allow the user to pick an <code>option</code> element in its
  <span title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</span> that
  is itself not <span
  title="concept-option-disabled">disabled</span>. Upon this
  <code>option</code> element being <dfn
  title="concept-select-pick">picked</dfn> (either through a click, or
  through unfocusing the element after changing its value, or through
  a <span title="option-command">menu command</span>, or through any
  other mechanism), and before the relevant user interaction event is
  queued (e.g. before the <span title="event-click">click</span>
  event), the user agent must set the <span
  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> of the
  picked <code>option</code> element to true and then <span>queue a
  task</span> to <span>fire a simple event</span> called <code
  title="event-change">change</code> at the <code>select</code>
  element, using the <span>user interaction task source</span> as the
  task source, then <span>broadcast <code

  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> set to true
  is added to the <code>select</code> element's <span

  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> of all the
  other <code>option</code> element in its <span
  title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</span> to

  true.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="attr-select-multiple">multiple</code>
  attribute is present, and the element is not <span
  title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>, then the user agent
  should allow the user to <dfn
  title="concept-select-toggle">toggle</dfn> the <span
  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> of the
  <code>option</code> elements in its <span

  themselves not <span title="concept-option-disabled">disabled</span>
  (either through a click, or through a <span
  title="option-command">menu command</span>, or any other
  mechanism). Upon the <span
  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> of one or
  more <code>option</code> elements being changed by the user, and
  before the relevant user interaction event is queued (e.g. before a
  related <span title="event-click">click</span> event), the user
  agent must <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple
  event</span> called <code title="event-change">change</code> at the
  <code>select</code> element, using the <span>user interaction task
  source</span> as the task source, then <span>broadcast <code
  title="event-formchange">formchange</code> events</span> at the
  element's <span>form owner</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="concept-form-reset-control">reset
  algorithm</span> for <code>select</code> elements is to go through
  all the <code>option</code> elements in the element's <span
  title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</span>, and set
  their <span title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span>
  to true if the <code>option</code> element has a <code
  title="attr-option-selected">selected</code> attribute, and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute is used to
  explicitly associate the <code>select</code> element with its
  <span>form owner</span>. The <code title="attr-fe-name">name</code>
  attribute represents the element's name. The <code
  title="attr-fe-disabled">disabled</code> attribute is used to make
  the control non-interactive and to prevent its value from being
  submitted. The <code title="attr-fe-autofocus">autofocus</code>
  attribute controls focus.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-select-type"><code>type</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, on getting, must return the string "<code
  title="">select-one</code>" if the <code
  title="attr-select-multiple">multiple</code> attribute is absent,
  and the string "<code title="">select-multiple</code>" if the <code
  title="attr-select-multiple">multiple</code> attribute is

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-select-options"><code>options</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must return an <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code>

  <p>The <code>option</code> element <span>represents</span> an option in a
  <code>select</code> element or as part of a list of suggestions in a
  <code>datalist</code> element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-option-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>. An
  <code>option</code> element is <dfn
  title="concept-option-disabled">disabled</dfn> if its <code
  title="attr-option-disabled">disabled</code> attribute is present or
  if it is a child of an <code>optgroup</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-optgroup-disabled">disabled</code> attribute is
  present.</p>

  <p>An <code>option</code> element that is <span
  title="attr-option-disabled">disabled</span> must prevent any <code
  title="event-click">click</code> events that are <span title="queue
  a task">queued</span> on the <span>user interaction task
  source</span> from being dispatched on the element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-option-label"><code>label</code></dfn>
  attribute provides a label for element. The <dfn
  title="concept-option-label">label</dfn> of an <code>option</code>
  element is the value of the <code
  title="attr-option-label">label</code> attribute, if there is one,
  or the <code>textContent</code> of the element, if there isn't.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-option-value"><code>value</code></dfn>
  attribute provides a value for element. The <dfn
  title="concept-option-value">value</dfn> of an <code>option</code>
  element is the value of the <code
  title="attr-option-value">value</code> attribute, if there is one,
  or the <code>textContent</code> of the element, if there isn't.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-option-selected"><code>selected</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the default <span
  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> of the
  element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</dfn>
  of an <code>option</code> element is a boolean state, initially
  false. If the element is <span
  title="concept-option-disabled">disabled</span>, then the element's
  <span title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> is
  always false and cannot be set to true. Unless othewise specified,
  when the element is created, its <span
  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> must be set
  to true if the element has a <code
  title="attr-option-selected">selected</code> attribute. Whenever an
  <code>option</code> element's <code
  title="attr-option-selected">selected</code> attribute is added, its
  <span title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> must
  be set to true.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code title="dom-option-tvd">Option()</code>
  constructor with two or more arguments overrides the initial state
  of the <span title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span>
  state to always be false even if the third argument is true
  (implying that a <code title="attr-option-selected">selected</code>
  attribute is to be set).</p>

  <p>An <code>option</code> element's <dfn
  title="concept-option-index">index</dfn> is the number of
  <code>option</code> element that are in the same <span
  title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</span> but that
  come before it in <span>tree order</span>. If the
  <code>option</code> element is not in a <span
  title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</span>, then the
  <code>option</code> element's <span
  title="concept-option-index">index</span> is zero.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-option-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn>,
  <dfn title="dom-option-label"><code>label</code></dfn>, and <dfn
  title="dom-option-value"><code>value</code></dfn> DOM attributes
  must <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the
  same name. The <dfn
  title="dom-option-defaultSelected"><code>defaultSelected</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-option-selected">selected</code> content attribute.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-option-selected"><code>selected</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must return true if the element's <span
  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> is true, and
  false otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-option-index"><code>index</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return the element's <span
  title="concept-option-index">index</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-option-text"><code>text</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return the same value as the <code>textContent</code>
  DOM attribute on the element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-option-form"><code>form</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute's behavior depends on whether the <code>option</code>
  element is in a <code>select</code> element or not. If the
  <code>option</code> has a <code>select</code> element as its parent,
  or has a <code>colgroup</code> element as its parent and that
  <code>colgroup</code> element has a <code>select</code> element as
  its parent, then the <code title="dom-option-form">form</code> DOM
  attribute must return the same value as the <code
  title="dom-fae-form">form</code> DOM attribute on that
  <code>select</code> element. Otherwise, it must return null.</p>

  <p>Several constructors are provided for creating
  <code>HTMLOptionElement</code> objects (in addition to the factory
  methods from DOM Core such as <code
  title="">createElement()</code>): <dfn
  title="dom-option"><code>Option()</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-option-t"><code>Option(<var
  title="">text</var>)</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-option-tv"><code>Option(<var title="">text</var>, <var
  title="">value</var>)</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-option-tvd"><code>Option(<var title="">text</var>, <var
  title="">value</var>, <var
  title="">defaultSelected</var>)</code></dfn>, and <dfn
  title="dom-option-tvds"><code>Option(<var title="">text</var>, <var
  title="">value</var>, <var title="">defaultSelected</var>, <var
  title="">selected</var>)</code></dfn>. When invoked as constructors,
  these must return a new <code>HTMLOptionElement</code> object (a new
  <code>option</code> element). If the <var title="">text</var>
  argument is present, the new object must have a text node<!-- XXX
  clarify that we don't mean a CDATASection? (see dfn of 'text node')
  --> with the value of that argument as its data as its only
  child. If the <var title="">value</var> argument is present, the new
  object must have a <code title="attr-option-value">value</code>
  attribute set with the value of the argument as its value. If the
  <var title="">defaultSelected</var> argument is present and true,
  the new object must have a <code
  title="attr-option-selected">selected</code> attribute set with no
  value. If the <var title="">selected</var> argument is present and
  true, the new object must have its <span
  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> set to true;
  otherwise the fouth argument is absent or false, and the <span
  title="concept-option-selectedness">selectedness</span> must be set
  to false, even if the <var title="">defaultSelected</var> argument
  is present and true.</p>

  <span title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span> nor has a <code
  title="attr-textarea-readonly">readonly</code> attribute
  specified.</p>

  <p>When a <code>textarea</code> is <span
  title="concept-textarea-mutable">mutable</span>, its <span
  title="concept-textarea-raw-value">raw value</span> should be
  editable by the user. Any time the user causes the element's <span
  title="concept-textarea-raw-value">raw value</span> to change, the
  user agent must <span>queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple
  event</span> called <code title="event-input">input</code> at the
  <code>textarea</code> element, then <span>broadcast <code
  title="event-forminput">forminput</code> events</span> at the
  <code>textarea</code> element's <span>form owner</span>. User agents
  may wait for a suitable break in the user's interaction before
  queuing the task; for example, a user agent could wait for the user
  to have not hit a key for 100ms, so as to only fire the event when
  the user pauses, instead of continuously for each keystroke.</p>
  <!-- same text is present in the <input> section -->

  <p>A <code>textarea</code> element has a <dfn
  title="concept-textarea-dirty">dirty value flag</dfn>, which must be
  initially set to false, and must be set to true whenever the user
  interacts with the control in a way that changes the <span
  title="concept-textarea-raw-value">raw value</span>.</p>

  <p>When the <code>textarea</code> element's <code>textContent</code>
  DOM attribute changes value, if the element's <span
  title="concept-textarea-dirty">dirty value flag</span> is false,
  then the element's <span title="concept-textarea-raw-value">raw
  value</span> must be set to the value of the element's
  <code>textContent</code> DOM attribute.</p>

  <p>The <span title="concept-form-reset-control">reset
  algorithm</span> for <code>textarea</code> elements is to set the
  element's <span title="concept-textarea-raw-value">value</span> to
  the value of the element's <code>textContent</code> DOM
  attribute.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-textarea-cols"><code>cols</code></dfn>
  attribute specifies the expected maximum number of characters per
  line. If the <code title="attr-textarea-cols">cols</code> attribute
  is specified, its value must be a <span>valid non-negative
  integer</span> greater than zero. If applying the <span>rules for
  parsing non-negative integers</span> to the attribute's value
  results in a number greater than zero, then the element's <dfn
  title="attr-textarea-cols-value">character width</dfn> is that value;
  otherwise, it is 20.</p>

  <p>The user agent may use the <code>textarea</code> element's <span
  title="attr-textarea-cols-value">character width</span> as a hint to
  the user as to how many characters the server prefers per line
  (e.g. for visual user agents by making the width of the control be
  that many characters). In visual renderings, the user agent should
  wrap the user's input in the rendering so that each line is no wider
  than this number of characters.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-textarea-rows"><code>rows</code></dfn>
  attribute specifies the number of lines to show. If the <code
  title="attr-textarea-rows">rows</code> attribute is specified, its
  value must be a <span>valid non-negative integer</span> greater than
  zero. If applying the <span>rules for parsing non-negative
  integers</span> to the attribute's value results in a number greater
  than zero, then the element's <dfn
  title="attr-textarea-rows-value">character height</dfn> is that
  value; otherwise, it is 2.</p>

  <p>Visual user agents should set the height of the control to the
  number of lines given by <span
  title="attr-textarea-rows-value">character height</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-textarea-wrap"><code>wrap</code></dfn>
  attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span> with two keywords
  and states: the <dfn
  title="attr-textarea-wrap-soft"><code>soft</code></dfn> keyword
  which maps to the <dfn
  title="attr-textarea-wrap-soft-state">Soft</dfn> state, and the the
  <dfn title="attr-textarea-wrap-hard"><code>hard</code></dfn> keyword
  which maps to the <dfn
  title="attr-textarea-wrap-hard-state">Hard</dfn> state. The
  <i>missing value default</i> is the <span
  title="attr-textarea-wrap-soft-state">Soft</span> state.</p>

  <p>If the element's <code title="attr-textarea-wrap">wrap</code>
  attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-textarea-wrap-hard-state">Hard</span> state, the <code
  title="attr-textarea-cols">cols</code> attribute must be
  specified.</p>

  <p>The element's <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is
  defined to be the element's <span
  title="concept-textarea-raw-value">raw value</span> with the
  following transformation applied:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Replace every occurance of a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
   character not followed by a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, and
   every occurance of a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character not proceeded
   by a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character, by a two-character
   string consisting of a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN - U+000A LINE FEED
   (CRLF) character pair.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element's <code
   title="attr-textarea-wrap">wrap</code> attribute is in the <span
   title="attr-textarea-wrap-hard-state">Hard</span> state, insert
   U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN - U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pairs
   into the string using a UA-defined algorithm so that each line so
   that each line has no more than <span
   title="attr-textarea-cols-value">character width</span>
   characters. The the purposes of this requirement, lines are
   delimited by the start of the string, the end of the string, and
   U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN - U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character
   pairs.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-textarea-maxlength"><code>maxlength</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span title="attr-fe-maxlength">form control <code
  title="">maxlength</code> attribute</span> controlled by the
  <code>textarea</code> element's <span
  title="concept-textarea-dirty">dirty value flag</span>.</p>

  <p>If the <code>textarea</code> element has a <span>maximum allowed
  value length</span>, then the element's children must be such that
  the <span>codepoint length</span> of the value of the element's
  <code>textContent</code> DOM attribute is equal to or less than the
  element's <span>maximum allowed value length</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-textarea-required"><code>required</code></dfn> attribute
  is a <span>boolean attribute</span>.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> If the element has its
  <code title="attr-textarea-required">required</code> attribute
  specified, and the element is <span
  title="concept-textarea-mutable">mutable</span>, and the element's
  <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is the empty string,
  then the element is <span>suffering from being missing</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute is used to
  explicitly associate the <code>textarea</code> element with its
  <span>form owner</span>. The <code title="attr-fe-name">name</code>
  attribute represents the element's name. The <code
  title="attr-fe-disabled">disabled</code> attribute is used to make
  the control non-interactive and to prevent its value from being
  submitted. The <code title="attr-fe-autofocus">autofocus</code>
  attribute controls focus.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-textarea-cols"><code>cols</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-textarea-required"><code>required</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-textarea-rows"><code>rows</code></dfn>, and <dfn
  title="dom-textarea-wrap"><code>wrap</code></dfn> attributes must
  <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the same
  name. The <code title="dom-textarea-cols">cols</code> and <code
  title="dom-textarea-rows">rows</code> attributes are <span>limited
  to only positive non-zero numbers</span>. The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea-maxLength"><code>maxLength</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-textarea-maxlength">maxlength</code> content attribute.
  The <dfn title="dom-textarea-readOnly"><code>readOnly</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-textarea-readonly">readonly</code> content
  attribute.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-textarea-type"><code>type</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return the value "<code title="">textarea</code>".</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea-defaultValue"><code>defaultValue</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must act like the element's <code>textContent</code>
  DOM attribute.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-textarea-value"><code>value</code></dfn>

  <p>The <code>output</code> element <span>represents</span> the result of a
  calculation.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-output-for"><code>for</code></dfn> content
  attribute allows an explicit relationship to be made between the
  result of a calculation and the elements that represent the values
  that went into the calculation or that otherwise influenced the
  calculation. The <code title="attr-output-for">for</code> attribute,
  if specified, must contain a string consisting of an <span>unordered
  set of unique space-separated tokens</span>, each of which must have
  the value of an ID of an element in the same
  <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute is used to
  explicitly associate the <code>output</code> element with its
  <span>form owner</span>. The <code title="attr-fe-name">name</code>
  attribute represents the element's name.</p>

  <p>The element has a <dfn title="concept-output-mode">value mode
  flag</dfn> which is either <i
  title="concept-output-mode-value">value</i> or <i
  title="concept-output-mode-default">default</i>. Initially the <span
  title="concept-output-mode">value mode flag</span> must be set to <i
  title="concept-output-mode-default">default</i>.</p>

  <p>When the to <span title="concept-output-mode">value mode
  flag</span> is in mode <i
  title="concept-output-mode-default">default</i>, the contents of the
  element represent both the value of the element and its default
  value. When the <span title="concept-output-mode">value mode
  flag</span> is in mode <i
  title="concept-output-mode-value">value</i>, the contents of the
  element represent the value of the element only, and the default
  value is only accessible using the <code
  title="dom-output-defaultValue">defaultValue</code> DOM
  attribute.</p>

  <p>The element also has a <dfn
  title="concept-output-defaultValue">default value</dfn>. Initially,
  the <span title="concept-output-defaultValue">default value</span>
  must be the empty string.</p>

  <p>Whenever the element's descendants are changed in any way, if the
  <span title="concept-output-mode">value mode flag</span> is in mode
  <i title="concept-output-mode-default">default</i>, the element's
  <span title="concept-output-defaultValue">default value</span> must
  be set to the value of the element's <code>textContent</code> DOM
  attribute.</p>

  <p>The <span title="concept-form-reset-control">reset
  algorithm</span> for <code>textarea</code> elements is to set the
  element's <code>textContent</code> DOM attribute to the value of the
  element's <code title="dom-output-defaultValue">defaultValue</code>
  DOM attribute (thus replacing the element's child nodes), and then
  to set the element's <span title="concept-output-mode">value mode
  flag</span> to <i
  title="concept-output-mode-default">default</i>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-output-value"><code>value</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must act like the element's <code>textContent</code> DOM
  attribute, except that on setting, in addition, before the child
  nodes are changed, the element's <span
  title="concept-output-mode">value mode flag</span> must be set to <i
  title="concept-output-mode-value">value</i>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-output-defaultValue"><code>defaultValue</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, on getting, must return the element's <span
  title="concept-output-defaultValue">default value</span>. On
  setting, the attribute must set the element's <span
  title="concept-output-defaultValue">default value</span>, and, if
  the element's <span title="concept-output-mode">value mode
  flag</span> is in the mode <i
  title="concept-output-mode-default">default</i>, set the element's
  <code>textContent</code> DOM attribute as well.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-output-type"><code>type</code></dfn>

  <h4>Association of controls and forms</h4>

  <!-- XXX consider xreffing the 'ID' term in this section -->

  <p>A <span>form-associated element</span> can have a relationship
  with a <code>form</code> element, which is called the element's
  <dfn>form owner</dfn>. If a <span>form-associated element</span> is
  not associated with a <code>form</code> element, its <span>form
  owner</span> is said to be null.</p>

  <p>A <span>form-associated element</span> is, by default, associated
  with its nearest ancestor <code>form</code> element (as described
  below), but may have a <dfn
  title="attr-fae-form"><code>form</code></dfn> attribute specified to
  override this.</p>

  <p>If a <span>form-associated element</span> has a <code
  title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute specified, then its
  value must be the ID of a <code>form</code> element in the element's
  owner <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>When a <span>form-associated element</span> is created, its
  <span>form owner</span> must be initialized to null (no owner).</p>

  <p>When a <span>form-associated element</span> is to be <dfn
  title="concept-form-association">associated</dfn> with a form, its
  <span>form owner</span> must be set to that form.</p>

  <p>When a <span>form-associated element</span>'s ancestor chain
  changes, e.g. because it or one of its ancestors was <span
  title="insert an element into a document">inserted</span> or
  removed<!--XXX--> from a <code>Document</code>, then the user agent
  must <span>reset the form owner</span> of that element.</p>

  <p>When a <span>form-associated element</span>'s <code
  title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute is added, removed, or
  has its value changed, then the user agent must <span>reset the form
  owner</span> of that element.</p>

  <p>When a <span>form-associated element</span> has a <code
  title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute and the ID of any of the
  <code>form</code> elements in the <code>Document</code> changes,
  then the user agent must <span>reset the form owner</span> of that
  <span>form-associated element</span>.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>reset the form owner</dfn> of a
  <span>form-associated element</span>, it must run the following
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the element's <span>form owner</span> is not null, and
   the element's <code title="attr-fae-form">form</code> content
   attribute is not present, and the element's <span>form owner</span>
   is one of the ancestors of the element after the change to the
   ancestor chain, then do nothing, and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let the element's <span>form owner</span> be null.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the element has a <code title="attr-fae-form">form</code>
    content attribute, then run these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <!-- XXX how does ID matching get affected by quirks mode? -->
     <li><p>If the first element in the <code>Document</code> to have
     an ID that is equal to the element's <code
     title="attr-fae-form">form</code> content attribute's value is a
     <code>form</code> element, then <span
     title="concept-form-association">associate</span> the
     <span>form-associated element</span> with that <code>form</code>
     element.</p></li>

     <li><p>Abort the "reset the form owner" steps.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if the <span>form-associated element</span> in
   question has an ancestor <code>form</code> element, then <span
   title="concept-form-association">associate</span> the
   <span>form-associated element</span> with the nearest such ancestor
   <code>form</code> element.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, the element is left unassociated.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p><span title="form-associated element">Form-associated
  elements</span> have a <dfn
  title="dom-fae-form"><code>form</code></dfn> DOM attribute, which,
  on getting, must return the element's <span>form owner</span>, or
  null if there isn't one.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> If an element has no
  <span>form owner</span>, it is <span>barred from constraint
  validation</span>.</p>



  <h4><dfn>Attributes common to form controls</dfn></h4>

  <h5>Naming form controls</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-fe-name"><code>name</code></dfn> content
  attribute gives the name of the form control, as used in <span>form
  submission</span> and in the <code>form</code> element's <code
  title="dom-form-elements">elements</code> object. If the attribute
  is specified, its value must not be the empty string.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> If an element does not
  have a <code title="attr-fe-name">name</code> attribute specified,
  or its <code title="attr-fe-name">name</code> attribute's value is
  the empty string, then it is <span>barred from constraint
  validation</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-fe-name"><code>name</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-fe-name">name</code> content attribute.</p>



  <h5>Enabling and disabling form controls</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-fe-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn>
  content attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>.</p>

  <p>A form control is <dfn title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</dfn>
  if its <code title="attr-fe-disabled">disabled</code> attribute is
  set, or if it is a descendant of a <code>fieldset</code> element
  whose <code title="attr-fieldset-disabled">disabled</code> attribute
  is set.</p>

  <p>A form control that is <span
  title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span> must prevent any <code
  title="event-click">click</code> events that are <span title="queue
  a task">queued</span> on the <span>user interaction task
  source</span> from being dispatched on the element.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> If an element is <span
  title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>, it is <span>barred from
  constraint validation</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-fe-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-fe-disabled">disabled</code> content attribute.</p>



  <h5>A form control's value</h5>

  <p>Form controls have a <dfn title="concept-fe-value">value</dfn>
  and a <dfn title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</dfn>. (The latter
  is only used by <code>input</code> elements.) These are used to
  describe how the user interacts with the control.</p>



  <h5>Autofocusing a form control</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-fe-autofocus"><code>autofocus</code></dfn>
  content attribute allows the user to indicate that a control is to
  be focused as soon as the page is loaded, allowing the user to just
  start typing without having to manually focus the main control.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-fe-autofocus">autofocus</code> attribute is
  a <span>boolean attribute</span>.</p>

  <p>There must not be more than one element in the document with the
  <code title="attr-fe-autofocus">autofocus</code> attribute
  specified.</p>

  <p>Whenever an element with the <code
  title="attr-fe-autofocus">autofocus</code> attribute specified is
  <span title="insert an element into a document">inserted into a
  document</span>, the user agent should <span>queue a task</span>
  that checks to see if the element is <span>focusable</span>, and if
  so, runs the <span>focusing steps</span> for that element. User
  agents may also change the scrolling position of the document, or
  perform some other action that brings the element to the user's
  attention. The <span>task source</span> for this task is the
  <span>DOM manipulation task source</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents may ignore this attribute if the user has indicated
  (for example, by starting to type in a form control) that he does
  not wish focus to be changed.</p>

  <p class="note">Focusing the control does not imply that the user
  agent must focus the browser window if it has lost focus.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-fe-autofocus"><code>autofocus</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must <span>reflect</span> the content attribute of the
  same name.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>In the following snippet, the text control would be focused when
   the document was loaded.</p>
   <pre>&lt;input maxlength="256" name="q" value="" autofocus&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="Search"&gt;</pre>
  </div>


  <h5>Limiting user input length</h5>

  <p>A <dfn title="attr-fe-maxlength">form control <code
  title="">maxlength</code> attribute</dfn>, controlled by a <var
  title="">dirty value flag</var> declares a limit on the number of
  characters a user can input.</p>

  <p>If an element has its <span title="attr-fe-maxlength">form
  control <code title="">maxlength</code> attribute</span> specified,
  the attribute's value must be a <span>valid non-negative
  integer</span>. If the attribute is specified and applying the
  <span>rules for parsing non-negative integers</span> to its value
  results in a number, then that number is the element's <dfn>maximum
  allowed value length</dfn>. If the attribute is omitted or parsing
  its value results in an error, then there is no <span>maximum
  allowed value length</span>.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation:</strong> If an element has a
  <span>maximum allowed value length</span>, and its <var
  title="">dirty value flag</var> is false, and the <span>codepoint
  length</span> of the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> is greater than the element's
  <span>maximum allowed value length</span>, then the element is
  <span>suffering from being too long</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents may prevent the user from causing the element's <span
  title="concept-fe-value">value</span> to be set to a value whose
  <span>codepoint length</span> is greater than the element's
  <span>maximum allowed value length</span>.</p>



  <h5><dfn title="attributes for form submission">Form submission</dfn></h5>

  <p>Attributes for form submission can be specified both on
  <code>form</code> elements and on elements that represent buttons
  that submit forms, e.g. an <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-submit">Submit Button</span> state. The
  attributes on the buttons, when omitted, default to the values given
  on the corresponding the <code>form</code> element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-fs-action"><code>action</code></dfn> content
  attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a <span>valid
  URL</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-fs-action">action</dfn> of an element is
  the value of the element's <code
  title="attr-fs-action">action</code> attribute, if it has one, or
  the value of its <span>form owner</span>'s <code
  title="attr-fs-action">action</code> attribute, if <em>it</em> has
  one, or else the empty string.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-fs-method"><code>method</code></dfn> content
  attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span> with the following
  keywords and states:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The keyword <dfn
   title="attr-fs-method-GET-keyword"><code>GET</code></dfn>, mapping
   to the state <dfn title="attr-fs-method-GET">GET</dfn>, indicating
   the HTTP GET method.</li>

   <li>The keyword <dfn
   title="attr-fs-method-POST-keyword"><code>POST</code></dfn>, mapping
   to the state <dfn title="attr-fs-method-POST">POST</dfn>, indicating
   the HTTP POST method.</li>

   <li>The keyword <dfn
   title="attr-fs-method-PUT-keyword"><code>PUT</code></dfn>, mapping
   to the state <dfn title="attr-fs-method-PUT">PUT</dfn>, indicating
   the HTTP PUT method.</li>

   <li>The keyword <dfn
   title="attr-fs-method-DELETE-keyword"><code>DELETE</code></dfn>, mapping
   to the state <dfn title="attr-fs-method-DELETE">DELETE</dfn>, indicating
   the HTTP DELETE method.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The <i>missing value default</i> is the <span
  title="attr-fs-method-GET">GET</span> state.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-fs-method">method</dfn> of an element is
  one of those four states. If the element has a <code
  title="attr-fs-method">method</code> attribute, then the element's
  <span title="concept-fs-method">method</span> is that attribute's
  state; otherwise, it is the <span>form owner</span>'s <code
  title="attr-fs-method">method</code> attribute's state.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-fs-enctype"><code>enctype</code></dfn>
  content attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span> with the
  following keywords and states:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>The "<dfn title="attr-fs-enctype-urlencoded"><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></dfn>" keyword and corresponding state.</li>
   <li>The "<dfn title="attr-fs-enctype-formdata"><code>multipart/form-data</code></dfn>" keyword and corresponding state.</li>
   <li>The "<dfn title="attr-fs-enctype-text"><code>text/plain</code></dfn>" keyword and corresponding state.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <i>missing value default</i> is the <code
  title="attr-fs-enctype-urlencoded">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>
  state.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-fs-enctype">enctype</dfn> of an element is
  one of those three states. If the element has a <code
  title="attr-fs-enctype">enctype</code> attribute, then the element's
  <span title="concept-fs-enctype">enctype</span> is that attribute's
  state; otherwise, it is the <span>form owner</span>'s <code
  title="attr-fs-enctype">enctype</code> attribute's state.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-fs-target"><code>target</code></dfn> content
  attribute, if present, must be a <span>valid browsing context name
  or keyword</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-fs-target">target</dfn> of an element is
  the value of the element's <code
  title="attr-fs-target">target</code> attribute, if it has one; or
  the value of its <span>form owner</span>'s <code
  title="attr-fs-target">target</code> attribute, if <em>it</em> has
  one; or, if one of the child nodes of <span>the <code>head</code>
  element</span> is a <code>base</code> element with a <code
  title="attr-base-target">target</code> attribute, then the the value
  of the <code title="attr-base-target">target</code> attribute of the
  first such <code>base</code> element; or, if there is no such
  element, the empty string.</p> <!-- c.f. hyperlink following -->

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-fs-novalidate"><code>novalidate</code></dfn>
  content attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>. If present,
  it indicates that the form is not to be validated during
  submission.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="concept-fs-novalidate">no-validate state</dfn> of
  an element is true if the element's <code
  title="attr-fs-novalidate">novalidate</code> attribute is present or
  if the element's <span>form owner</span>'s <code
  title="attr-fs-novalidate">novalidate</code> attribute is present,
  and false otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-fs-action"><code>action</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-fs-method"><code>method</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-fs-enctype"><code>enctype</code></dfn>, and <dfn
  title="dom-fs-target"><code>target</code></dfn> DOM attributes must
  <span>reflect</span> the respective content attributes of the same
  name. The <dfn
  title="dom-fs-noValidate"><code>noValidate</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must reflect the <code
  title="attr-fs-novalidate">novalidate</code> content attribute.</p>
  


  <h4>Constraints</h4>

  <h5>Definitions</h5>

  <p>A <span title="category-listed">listed form-associated
  element</span> is a <dfn>candidate for constraint validation</dfn>
  unless a condition has <dfn title="barred from constraint
  validation">barred the element from constraint
  validation</dfn>. (For example, an element is <span>barred from
  constraint validation</span> if it is an <code>output</code> or
  <code>fieldset</code> element.)</p>

  <p>An element can have a <dfn>custom validity error message</dfn>
  defined. Initially, an element must have its <span>custom validity
  error message</span> set to the empty string. When its value is not
  the empty string, the element is <span>suffering from a custom
  error</span>. It can be set using the <code
  title="dom-cva-setCustomValidity">setCustomValidity()</code>
  method. The user agent should use the <span>custom validity error
  message</span> when alerting the user to the problem with the
  control.</p>

  <p>An element can be constrained in various ways. The following is
  the list of <dfn>validity states</dfn> that a form control can be
  in, making the control invalid for the purposes of constraint
  validation. (The definitions below are non-normative; other parts of
  this specification define more precisely when each state applies or
  does not.)</p>

  </dl>

  <p class="note">An element can still suffer from these states even

  <h5>Constraint validation</h5>

  <p>When the user agent is required to <dfn>statically validate the
  constraints</dfn> of <code>form</code> element <var
  title="">form</var>, it must run the following steps, which return
  either a <i>positive</i> result (all the controls in the form are
  valid) or a <i>negative</i> result (there are invalid controls)
  along with a (possibly empty) list of elements that are invalid and
  for which no script has claimed responsibility:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">controls</var> be a list of all the <span
   title="category-submit">submittable</span> elements whose
   <span>form owner</span> is <var title="">form</var>, in <span>tree
   order</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">invalid controls</var> be an initially
   empty list of elements.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>For each element <var title="">field</var> in <var
    title="">controls</var>, in <span>tree order</span>, run the
    following substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If <var title="">field</var> is not a <span>candidate for
     constraint validation</span>, then move on to the next
     element.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, if <var title="">field</var> <span
     title="concept-fv-valid">satisfies its constaints</span>, then
     move on to the next element.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, add <var title="">field</var> to <var
     title="">invalid controls</var>.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">invalid controls</var> is empty, then
   return a <i>positive</i> result and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">unhandled invalid controls</var> be an
   initially empty list of elements.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>For each element <var title="">field</var> in <var
    title="">invalid controls</var>, if any, in <span>tree
    order</span>, run the following substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p><span>Fire a simple event</span> named <code
     title="event-invalid">invalid</code> at <var
     title="">field</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If the event was not canceled, then add <var
     title="">field</var> to <var title="">unhandled invalid
     controls</var>.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return a <i>negative</i> result with the list of elements in
   the <var title="">unhandled invalid controls</var> list.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>If a user agent is to <dfn>interactively validate the
  constraints</dfn> of <code>form</code> element <var
  title="">form</var>, then the user agent must run the following
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p><span>Statically validate the constraints</span> of <var
   title="">form</var>, and let <var title="">unhandled invalid
   controls</var> be the list of elements returned if the result was
   <i>negative</i>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the result was <i>positive</i>, then return that result
   and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Report the problems with the constraints of at least one of
   the elements given in <var title="">unhandled invalid
   controls</var> to the user. User agents may focus one of those
   elements in the process, by running the <span>focusing steps</span>
   for that element, and may change the scrolling position of the
   document, or perform some other action that brings the element to
   the user's attention. User agents may report more than one
   constraint violation. User agents may coalesce related constraint
   violation reports if appropriate (e.g. if multiple radio buttons in
   a <span title="radio button group">group</span> are marked as
   required, only one error need be reported). If one of the controls
   is not visible to the user (e.g. it has the <code
   title="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute set) then user agents
   may report a script error.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return a <i>negative</i> result.</p></li>

  </ol>



  <h5>The <dfn>constraint validation API</dfn></h5>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-cva-willValidate"><code>willValidate</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if an element is a <span>candidate for
  constraint validation</span>, and false otherwise (i.e. false if any
  conditions are <span title="barred from constraint
  validation">barring it from constraint validation</span>).</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-cva-setCustomValidity"><code>setCustomValidity(<var
  title="">message</var>)</code></dfn>, when invoked, must set the
  <span>custom validity error message</span> to the value of the given
  <var title="">message</var> argument.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-cva-validity"><code>validity</code></dfn>
  attribute must return a <code>ValidityState</code> object that
  represents the <span>validity states</span> of the element. This
  object is live, and the same object must be returned each time the
  element's <code title="dom-cva-validity">validity</code> attribute
  is retrieved.</p>

<pre class="idl">interface <dfn>ValidityState</dfn> {
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-ValidityState-valueMissing">valueMissing</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-ValidityState-typeMismatch">typeMismatch</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-ValidityState-patternMismatch">patternMismatch</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-ValidityState-tooLong">tooLong</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-ValidityState-rangeUnderflow">rangeUnderflow</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-ValidityState-rangeOverflow">rangeOverflow</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-ValidityState-stepMismatch">stepMismatch</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-ValidityState-customError">customError</span>;
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-ValidityState-valid">valid</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>A <code>ValidityState</code> object has the following
  attributes. On getting, they must return true if the corresponding
  condition given in the following list is true, and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn title="dom-ValidityState-valueMissing"><code>valueMissing</code></dfn></dt>
   <dd> <p>The control is <span>suffering from being missing</span>.</p> </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-ValidityState-tooLong"><code>tooLong</code></dfn></dt>
   <dd> <p>The control is <span>suffering from being too long</span>.</p> </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-ValidityState-rangeUnderflow"><code>rangeUnderflow</code></dfn></dt>
   <dd> <p>The control is <span>suffering from an underflow</span>.</p> </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-ValidityState-rangeOverflow"><code>rangeOverflow</code></dfn></dt>
   <dd> <p>The control is <span>suffering from an overflow</span>.</p> </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-ValidityState-stepMismatch"><code>stepMismatch</code></dfn></dt>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-ValidityState-valid"><code>valid</code></dfn></dt>
   <dd> <p>None of the other conditions are true.</p> </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-cva-checkValidatity"><code>checkValidity()</code></dfn>
  method is invoked, if the element is a <span>candidate for
  constraint validation</span> and does not <span
  title="concept-fv-valid">satisfy its constaints</span>, the user
  agent must <span>fire a simple event</span> named <code
  title="event-invalid">invalid</code> at the element and return
  false. Otherwise, it must only return true without doing anything
  else.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-cva-validationMessage"><code>validationMessage</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the empty string if the element is not a
  <span>candidate for constraint validation</span> or if it is one but
  it <span title="concept-fv-valid">satisfies its constaints</span>;
  otherwise, it must return a suitably localised message that the user
  agent would show the user if this were the only form with a validity
  constraint problem. If the element is <span>suffering from a custom
  error</span>, then the <span>custom validity error message</span>
  should be present in the return value.</p>



  <h5>Security</h5>

  <p>Servers should not rely on client-side validation. Client-side
  validation can be intentionally bypassed by hostile users, and
  unintentionally bypassed by users of older user agents or automated
  tools that do not implement these features. The constraint
  validation features are only intended to improve the user
  experience, not to provide any kind of security mechanism.</p>





  <h4><dfn>Form submission</dfn></h4>

  <h5>Implicit submission</h5>

  <p>User agents may establish a <span
  title="concept-button">button</span> in each form as being the
  form's <dfn>default button</dfn>. This should be the first <span
  title="concept-submit-button">submit button</span> in <span>tree
  order</span> whose <span>form owner</span> is that <code>form</code>
  element, but user agents may pick another button if another would be
  more appropriate for the platform. If the platform supports letting
  the user submit a form implicitly (for example, on some platforms
  hitting the "enter" key while a text field is focused implicitly
  submits the form), then doing so must cause the form's <span>default
  button</span>'s <span>activation behavior</span>, if any, to be
  run.</p>

  <p class="note">Consequently, if the <span>default button</span> is
  <span title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>, the form is not
  submitted when such an implicit submission mechanism is used. (A
  button has no <span>activation behavior</span> when disabled.)</p>

  <p>If the form has no <span title="concept-submit-button">submit
  button</span>, then the implicit submission mechanism must just
  <span title="concept-form-submit">submit</span> the
  <code>form</code> element from the <code>form</code> element
  itself.</p>


  <h5>Form submission algorithm</h5>

  <p>When a form <var title="">form</var> is <dfn
  title="concept-form-submit">submitted</dfn> from an element <var
  title="">submitter</var> (typically a button), the user agent must
  run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li id="sandboxSubmitBlocked"><p>If <var title="">form</var> is in
   a <code>Document</code> that has no associated <span>browsing
   context</span> or whose <span>browsing context</span> has its
   <span>sandboxed forms browsing context flag</span> set, then abort
   these steps without doing anything.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">form</var> is already being submitted
   (i.e. the form was <span
   title="concept-form-submit">submitted</span> again while processing
   the events fired from the next two steps, probably from a script
   redundantly calling the <code
   title="dom-form-submit">submit()</code> method on <var
   title="">form</var>), then abort these steps. This doesn't affect
   the earlier instance of this algorithm.</p></li>

   <!-- lock (implicit in previous step) -->

   <li><p>If the <var title="">submitter</var> is anything but a
   <code>form</code> element, and the <var title="">submitter</var>
   element's <span title="concept-fs-novalidate">no-validate
   state</span> is false, then <span>interactively validate the
   constraints</span> of <var title="">form</var> and examine the
   result: if the result is negative (the constraint validation
   concluded that there were invalid fields and probably informed the
   user of this) then abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var title="">submitter</var> is anything but a
   <code>form</code> element, then <span>fire a simple event</span>
   that bubbles<!--XXX check it bubbles-->, named <code
   title="event-submit">submit</code>, at <var title="">form</var>. If
   the event's default action is prevented (i.e. if the event is
   canceled) then abort these steps. Otherwise, continue (effectively
   the default action is to perform the submission).</p></li>

   <!-- if you add any steps between the "lock" and "unlock" lines,
   make sure to update the step immediately before the "lock" line -->

   <!-- unlock -->

   <li><p>Let <var title="">controls</var> be a list of all the <span
   title="category-submit">submittable</span> elements whose
   <span>form owner</span> is <var title="">form</var>, in <span>tree
   order</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let the <var title="">form data set</var> be a list of
   name-value-type tuples, initially empty.</p></li>

  <h5>Multipart form data</h5>

  <p>The <dfn><code title="">multipart/form-data</code> encoding
  algorithm</dfn> is to encode the <var title="">form data set</var>
  using the rules described by RFC2388, <cite>Returning Values from
  Forms: <code title="">multipart/form-data</code></cite>, and return
  the resulting byte stream. <a href="#refsRFC2388">[RFC2388]</a></p>

  <p>Each entry in the <var title="">form data set</var> is a
  <i>field</i>, the name of the entry is the <i>field name</i> and the
  value of the entry is the <i>field value</i>.</p>

  <p>The order of parts must be the same as the order of fields in the
  <var title="">form data set</var>. Multiple entries with the same
  name must be treated as distinct fields.</p>

  <!-- XXX define default encoding? -->


  <h5>Plain text form data</h5>

  <p>The <dfn><code title="">text/plain</code> encoding

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">result</var> be the empty string.</p></li>

   <li>

    <!-- this is different from application/x-www-form-urlencoded in

  <h4>Resetting a form</h4>

  <p>When a form <var title="">form</var> is <dfn
  title="concept-form-reset">reset</dfn>, the user agent must invoke
  the <span title="concept-form-reset-control">reset algorithm</span>
  of each <span title="category-reset">resettable</span> elements
  whose <span>form owner</span> is <var title="">form</var>, and must
  then <span>broadcast <code
  title="event-formchange">formchange</code> events</span> from <var
  title="">form</var>.</p>

  <p>Each <span title="category-reset">resettable</span> element
  defines its own <dfn title="concept-form-reset-control">reset
  algorithm</dfn>. Changes made to form controls as part of these
  algorithms do not count as changes caused by the user (and thus,
  e.g., do not cause <code title="event-input">input</code> events to
  fire).</p>



  <h4>Event dispatch</h4>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>broadcast <code
  title="event-forminput">forminput</code> events</dfn> or
  <dfn>broadcast <code title="event-formchange">formchange</code>
  events</dfn> from a <code>form</code> element <var
  title="">form</var>, it must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">controls</var> be a list of all the <span
   title="category-reset">resettable</span> elements whose <span>form
   owner</span> is <var title="">form</var>.</p></li>

   <li>If the user agent was to <span>broadcast <code

  <p>The <code>datagrid</code> element <span>represents</span> an interactive

  <p>The data being presented can come either from the content, as
  elements given as children of the <code>datagrid</code> element, or
  from a scripted data provider given by the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> DOM attribute.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-datagrid-multiple">multiple</code> and
  <code title="attr-datagrid-disabled">disabled</code> attributes are
  <span title="boolean attribute">boolean attributes</span>. Their
  effects are described in the processing model sections below.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-multiple"><code>multiple</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn> DOM
  attributes must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-datagrid-multiple">multiple</code> and <code
  title="attr-datagrid-disabled">disabled</code> content attributes
  respectively.</p>


  <h5>The <code>datagrid</code> data model</h5>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>In the <code>datagrid</code> data model, data is structured as a
  set of rows representing a tree, each row being split into a number
  of columns. The columns are always present in the data model,
  although individual columns may be hidden in the presentation.</p>

  <p>Each row can have child rows. Child rows may be hidden or
  shown, by closing or opening (respectively) the parent row.</p>

  <p>Rows are referred to by the path along the tree that one would
  take to reach the row, using zero-based indices. Thus, the first row
  of a list is row "0", the second row is row "1"; the first child row
  of the first row is row "0,0", the second child row of the first row
  is row "0,1"; the fourth child of the seventh child of the third
  child of the tenth row is "9,2,6,3", etc.</p>

  <p>The columns can have captions. Those captions are not considered
  a row in their own right, they are obtained separately.</p>

  <p>Selection of data in a <code>datagrid</code> operates at the row
  level. If the <code title="attr-datagrid-multiple">multiple</code>
  attribute is present, multiple rows can be selected at once,
  otherwise the user can only select one row at a time.</p>

  <p>The <code>datagrid</code> element can be disabled entirely by
  setting the <code title="attr-datagrid-disabled">disabled</code>
  attribute.</p>
<!--XXXDND
  <p class="XXX">selection draggable [normative definitions are
  in the interactive part below]</p>
-->

  <p>Columns, rows, and cells can each have specific flags, known as
  classes, applied to them by the data provider. These classes <a
  href="#datagridClassSummary">affect the functionality</a> of the
  <code>datagrid</code> element, and are also <a
  href="#datagridPseudos">passed to the style system</a>. They are
  similar in concept to the <code title="attr-class">class</code>
  attribute, except that they are not specified on elements but are
  given by scripted data providers.</p> <!-- XXX check xrefs -->


  <h5>How rows are identified</h5>

  <p>The chains of numbers that give a row's path, or identifier, are
  represented by objects that implement the
  <span>RowSpecification</span> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">[NoInterfaceObject] interface <dfn>RowSpecification</dfn> {
  // binding-specific interface
};</pre>

  <p>In ECMAScript, two classes of objects are said to implement this
  interface: Numbers representing non-negative integers, and
  homogeneous arrays of Numbers representing non-negative
  integers. Thus, <code>[1,0,9]</code> is a
  <span>RowSpecification</span>, as is <code>1</code> on its
  own. However, <code>[1,0.2,9]</code> is not a
  <span>RowSpecification</span> object, since its second value is not
  an integer.</p>

  <p>User agents must always represent <code>RowSpecification</code>s
  in ECMAScript by using arrays, even if the path only has one
  number.</p>

  <p>The root of the tree is represented by the empty path; in
  ECMAScript, this is the empty array (<code>[]</code>). Only the
  <code title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> and
  <code
  title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">GetChildAtPosition()</code>
  methods ever get called with the empty path.</p>


  <h5>The data provider interface</h5>

  implementation of the <code>DataGridDataProvider</code>, including
  (and most commonly) the content author's implementation(s).</em></p>

  <p>The <code>DataGridDataProvider</code> interface represents the
  interface that objects must implement to be used as custom data
  views for <code>datagrid</code> elements.</p>

  <p>Not all the methods are required. The minimum number of methods
  that must be implemented in a useful view is two: the <code
  title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> and <code
  title="dom-provider-getCellData">getCellData()</code> methods.</p>

  <p>Once the object is written, it must be hooked up to the
  <code>datagrid</code> using the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-data"><code>data</code></dfn> DOM attribute.</p>

  <p>The following methods may be usefully implemented:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-initialize"><code>initialize(<var title="">datagrid</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Called by the <code>datagrid</code> element (the one given by
   the <var title="">datagrid</var> argument) after it has first
   populated itself. This would typically be used to set the initial
   selection of the <code>datagrid</code> element when it is first
   loaded. The data provider could also use this method call to
   register a <code title="event-select">select</code> event handler
   on the <code>datagrid</code> in order to monitor selection
   changes.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getRowCount"><code>getRowCount(<var title="">row</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return the number of rows that are children of the
   specified <var title="">row</var>, including rows that are
   off-screen. If <var title="">row</var> is empty, then the number of
   rows at the top level must be returned. If the value that this
   method would return for a given <var title="">row</var> changes,
   the relevant update methods on the <code>datagrid</code> must be
   called first. Otherwise, this method must always return the same
   number. For a list (as opposed to a tree), this method must return
   0 whenever it is called with a <var title="">row</var> identifier
   that is not empty.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition"><code>getChildAtPosition(<var title="">parentRow</var>, <var title="">position</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return the index of the row that is a child of <var
   title="">parentRow</var> and that is to be positioned as the <var
   title="">position</var>th row under <var title="">parentRow</var>
   when rendering the children of <var title="">parentRow</var>. If
   <var title="">parentRow</var> is empty, then <var
   title="">position</var> refers to the <var
   title="">position</var>th row at the top level of the data
   grid. May be omitted if the rows are always to be sorted in the
   natural order. (The natural order is the one where the method
   always returns <var title="">position</var>.) For a given <var
   title="">parentRow</var>, this method must never return the same
   value for different values of <var title="">position</var>. The
   returned value <var title="">x</var> must be in the range
   0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var title="">x</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var
   title="">n</var>, where <var title="">n</var> is the value returned
   by <code title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount(<var
   title="">parentRow</var>)</code>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getColumnCount"><code>getColumnCount()</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return the number of columns currently in the data model
   (including columns that might be hidden). May be omitted if there
   is only one column. If the value that this method would return
   changes, the <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
   title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything">updateEverything()</code>
   method must be called.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getCaptionText"><code>getCaptionText(<var title="">column</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must return the caption, or label, for column <var
   title="">column</var>. May be omitted if the columns have no
   captions. If the value that this method would return changes, the
   <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
   title="dom-datagrid-updateColumnChanged">updateColumnChanged()</code>
   method must be called with the appropriate column index.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-provider-getCaptionClasses"><code>getCaptionClasses(<var title="">column</var>, <var title="">classes</var>)</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>Must add the classes that apply to column <var
   title="">column</var> to the <var title="">classes</var> object.
   May be omitted if the columns have no special classes. If the
   classes that this method would add changes, the
   <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
   title="dom-datagrid-updateColumnChanged">updateColumnChanged()</code>

  <h5>The default data provider</h5>

  <p>The user agent must supply a default data provider for the case
  where the <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
  title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> attribute is null. It must act
  as described in this section.</p>

  <p>The behavior of the default data provider depends on the nature
  of the first element child of the <code>datagrid</code>.</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <!-- XXX some of these entries say "the method must return" and
   other say "the characteristic must be"; this should be rationalized

    <p><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount(<var title="">row</var>)</code></strong>:
    The number of rows returned by the default data provider for the
    root of the tree (when <var title="">row</var> is empty) must be the total number of <code>tr</code> elements
    that are children of <code>tbody</code> elements that are children
    of the <code>table</code>, if there are any such child
    <code>tbody</code> elements. If there are no such
    <code>tbody</code> elements then the number of rows returned for
    the root must be the number of <code>tr</code> elements that are
    children of the <code>table</code>.</p>

    <p>When <var title="">row</var> is not empty, the number of rows
    returned must be zero.</p>

    <p class="note">The <code>table</code>-based default data provider
    cannot represent a tree.</p>

    <p class="note">Rows in <code>thead</code> elements do not
    contribute to the number of rows returned, although they do affect
    the columns and column captions. Rows in <code>tfoot</code>

    this algorithm.</p>

    <p id="defaultDataProviderTableMapper"><strong><code

    <p><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-getColumnCount">getColumnCount()</code></strong>:
    The number of columns returned must be the number of
    <code>td</code> element children in the first <code>tr</code>
    element child of the first <code>tbody</code> element child of the
    <code>table</code>, if there are any such <code>tbody</code>
    elements. If there are no such <code>tbody</code> elements, then
    it must be the number of <code>td</code> element children in the
    first <code>tr</code> element child of the <code>table</code>, if
    any, or otherwise 1. If the number that would be returned by these
    rules is 0, then 1 must be returned instead.</p>

    all captions. Otherwise, the value of the <code>textContent</code>
    attribute of the <var title="">i</var>th <code>th</code> element
    child of the first <code>tr</code> element child of the first
    <code>thead</code> element child of the <code>table</code> element

    empty string must be returned.</p>

    <p><strong><code

    the <code>table</code> has no <code>thead</code> element child, or
    if its first <code>thead</code> element child has no

    <code>tr</code> element child of the first <code>thead</code>
    element child of the <code>table</code> element must be added to
    the <var title="">classes</var>. If there is no such
    <code>th</code> element, no classes must be added. The user agent
    must then:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>Remove the <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-sorted">sorted</code> and <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-reversed">reversed</code>
     classes.</li>

     <li>If the <code>table</code> element has a <code
     title="attr-class">class</code> attribute that includes the <code
     title="">sortable</code> class, add the <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-sortable">sortable</code>
     class.</li>

     <li>If the column is the one currently being used to
     sort the data, add the <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-sorted">sorted</code> class.</li>

     <li>If the column is the one currently being used to sort the
     data, and it is sorted in descending order, add the <code
     title="datagrid-column-class-reversed">reversed</code> class as
     well.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>The various row- and cell- related methods operate relative to
    a particular element, the element of the row or cell specified by
    their arguments.</p>

    <p><strong>For rows</strong>: Since the default data provider for
    a <code>table</code> always returns 0 as the number of children
    for any row other than the root, the path to the row passed to
    these methods will always consist of a single number. In the prose
    below, this number is referred to as <var title="">i</var>.</p>

    <p>If the <code>table</code> has <code>tbody</code> element
    children, the element for the <var title="">i</var>th row is the
    <var title="">i</var>th <code>tr</code> element that is a child of
    a <code>tbody</code> element that is a child of the
    <code>table</code> element. If the <code>table</code> does not
    have <code>tbody</code> element children, then the element for the
    <var title="">i</var>th real row is the <var title="">i</var>th
    <code>tr</code> element that is a child of the <code>table</code>
    element.</p>

    <p><strong>For cells</strong>: Given a row and its element, the
    row's <var title="">i</var>th cell's element is the <var
    title="">i</var>th <code>td</code> element child of the row
    element.</p>

    <p class="note">The <code>colspan</code> and <code>rowspan</code>
    attributes are <span title="ignore">ignored</span> by this

    <p><strong><code title="dom-provider-getRowImage">getRowImage(<var

    relative to that element, if there is one and resolving its
    attribute is successful. Otherwise, the <span>URL</span> of the
    row's image is the empty string.</p> <!-- note that if the base
    URL has changed, this URL can be different than the one that the
    <img> element fetched when it was created -->

    <p><strong><code title="dom-provider-getRowMenu">getRowMenu(<var
    title="">i</var>)</code></strong>: If the row's first cell's
    element has a <code>menu</code> element child, then the row's menu
    is the first <code>menu</code> element child of the row's first
    cell's element. Otherwise, the row has no menu.</p>

    <p><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-getRowClasses">getRowClasses(<var
    title="">i</var>, <var title="">classes</var>)</code></strong>:
    The default data provider must never add a class to the row's
    classes.</p>

    <p id="defaultDataProviderTableSort"><strong><code
    title="dom-provider-toggleColumnSortState">toggleColumnSortState(<var
    title="">i</var>)</code></strong>: If the data is already being
    sorted on the given column, then the user agent must change the
    current sort mapping to be the inverse of the current sort
    mapping; if the sort order was ascending before, it is now
    descending, otherwise it is now ascending. Otherwise, if the
    current sort column is another column, or the data model is
    currently not sorted, the user agent must create a new mapping,
    which maps rows in the data model to rows in the DOM so that the
    rows in the data model are sorted by the specified column, in
    ascending order. (Which sort comparison operator to use is left up
    to the UA to decide.)</p>

    <p>When the sort mapping is changed, the values returned by the
    <code
    title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">getChildAtPosition()</code>
    method for the default data provider <a
    href="#defaultDataProviderTableMapper">will change
    appropriately</a>.</p>

    <p><strong><code title="dom-provider-getCellData">getCellData(<var

    <var title="">j</var>, <var title="">data</var>)</code></strong>:
    See <a href="#commonDefaultDataGridMethodDefinitions">the common
    definitions below</a>.</p>

    <p>The data provider must call the <code>datagrid</code>'s update
    methods appropriately whenever the descendants of the
    <code>datagrid</code> mutate. For example, if a <code>tr</code> is
    removed, then the <code
    title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsRemoved">updateRowsRemoved()</code>
    methods would probably need to be invoked, and any change to a
    cell or its descendants must cause the cell to be updated. If the
    <code>table</code> element stops being the first child of the
    <code>datagrid</code>, then the data provider must call the <code
    title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything">updateEverything()</code>
    method on the <code>datagrid</code>. Any change to a cell that is
    in the column that the data provider is currently using as its
    sort column must also cause the sort to be reperformed, with a
    call to <code
    title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything">updateEverything()</code> if
    the change did affect the sort order.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>While the first element child is a <code>select</code> or <code>datalist</code> element</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The default data provider must return 1 for the column count,
    the empty string for the column's caption, and must not add any
    classes to the column's classes.</p>

    <p>For the rows, assume the existence of a node filter view of the
    descendants of the first element child of the
    <code>datagrid</code> element (the <code>select</code> or
    <code>datalist</code> element), that skips all nodes other than
    <code>optgroup</code> and <code>option</code> elements, as well as
    any descendants of any <code>option</code> elements.</p>

    <p>Given a path <var title="">row</var>, the corresponding element
    is the one obtained by drilling into the view, taking the child
    given by the path each time.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Given the following XML markup:</p>

     <pre>&lt;datagrid>
 &lt;select>
  &lt;!-- the options and optgroups have had their labels and values removed
       to make the underlying structure clearer -->
  &lt;optgroup>
   &lt;option/>
   &lt;option/>
  &lt;/optgroup>
  &lt;optgroup>
   &lt;option/>
   &lt;optgroup id="a">
    &lt;option/>
    &lt;option/>
    &lt;bogus/>
    &lt;option id="b"/>
   &lt;/optgroup>
   &lt;option/>
  &lt;/optgroup>
 &lt;/select>
&lt;/datagrid></pre>

     <p>The path "1,1,2" would select the element with ID "b". In the
     filtered view, the text nodes, comment nodes, and bogus elements
     are ignored; so for instance, the element with ID "a" (path
     "1,1") has only 3 child nodes in the view.</p>

    </div>

    <p><code title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount(<var
    title="">row</var>)</code> must drill through the view to find the
    element corresponding to the method's argument, and return the
    number of child nodes in the filtered view that the corresponding
    element has. (If the <var title="">row</var> is empty, the
    corresponding element is the <code>select</code> element at the
    root of the filtered view.)</p>

    <p><code
    title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">getChildAtPosition(<var
    title="">row</var>, <var title="">position</var>)</code> must
    return <var title="">position</var>. (The

    does not support sorting the data grid.)</p>

    <p><code title="dom-provider-getRowImage">getRowImage(<var

  <h5>Populating the <code>datagrid</code> element</h5>

  <p>A <code>datagrid</code> must be disabled until its end tag has
  been parsed<!-- XXX do we define that? what if the end tag is never
  seen, but the element is popped off the stack?--> (in the case of a
  <code>datagrid</code> element in the original document markup) or
  until it has been <span title="insert an element into a
  document">inserted into the document</span> (in the case of a
  dynamically created element). After that point, the element must
  fire a single <code title="event-load">load</code> event at itself,
  which doesn't bubble and cannot be canceled.</p>

  <p class="XXX">The end-tag parsing thing should be moved to
  the parsing section.</p>

  <p>The <code>datagrid</code> must then populate itself using the
  data provided by the data provider assigned to the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> DOM attribute. After the view
  is populated (using the methods described below), the
  <code>datagrid</code> must invoke the <code
  title="dom-provider-initialize">initialize()</code> method on the
  data provider specified by the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> attribute, passing itself (the
  <code>HTMLDataGridElement</code> object) as the only argument.</p>

  <p>When the <code title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code> attribute is
  null, the <code>datagrid</code> must use the default data provider
  described in the previous section.</p>

  <p>To obtain data from the data provider, the element must invoke
  methods on the data provider object in the following ways:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>To determine the total number of columns</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getColumnCount">getColumnCount()</code> method
   with no arguments. The return value is the number of columns. If
   the return value is zero or negative, not an integer, or simply not
   a numeric type, or if the method is not defined, then 1 must be
   used instead.</dd>

   <dt>To get the captions to use for the columns</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getCaptionText">getCaptionText()</code> method
   with the index of the column in question. The index <var
   title="">i</var> must be in the range 0 &le; <var title="">i</var>
   &lt; <var title="">N</var>, where <var title="">N</var> is the
   total number of columns. The return value is the string to use when
   referring to that column. If the method returns null or the empty
   string, the column has no caption. If the method is not defined,
   then none of the columns have any captions.</dd>

   <dt>To establish what classes apply to a column</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getCaptionClasses">getCaptionClasses()</code>
   method with the index of the column in question, and an object
   implementing the <code>DOMTokenList</code> interface, associated
   with an anonymous empty string. The index <var title="">i</var>
   must be in the range 0 &le; <var title="">i</var> &lt; <var
   title="">N</var>, where <var title="">N</var> is the total number
   of columns. The tokens contained in the string underlying
   <code>DOMTokenList</code> object when the method returns represent
   the classes that apply to the given column. If the method is not
   defined, no classes apply to the column.</dd>

   <dt>To establish whether a column should be initially included in
   the visible columns</dt>

   <dd>Check whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-initially-hidden">initially-hidden</code>
   class applies to the column. If it does, then the column should not
   be initially included; if it does not, then the column should be
   initially included.</dd>

   <dt id="columnType2">To establish whether the data can be sorted
   relative to a particular column</dt>

   <dd>Check whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-sortable">sortable</code> class
   applies to the column. If it does, then the user agent should offer
   the user the option to have the data displayed sorted by that
   column; if it does not, then the user agent must not allow the user
   to ask for the data to be sorted by that column.</dd>

   <dt>To establish if a column is a sorted column</dt>

   <dd>If the user agent can handle multiple columns being marked as
   sorted simultaneously: Check whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-sorted">sorted</code> class applies to
   the column. If it does, then that column is the sorted column,
   otherwise it is not.</dd>

   <dd>If the user agent can only handle one column being marked as
   sorted at a time: Check each column in turn, starting with the
   first one, to see whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-sorted">sorted</code> class applies to
   that column. The first column that has that class, if any, is the
   sorted column. If none of the columns have that class, there is no
   sorted column.</dd>

   <dt>To establish the sort direction of a sorted column</dt>

   <dd>Check whether the <code
   title="datagrid-column-class-reversed">reversed</code> class
   applies to the column. If it does, then the sort direction is
   descending (down; first rows have the highest values), otherwise it
   is ascending (up; first rows have the lowest values).</dd>

   <dt>To determine the total number of rows</dt>

   <dd>Determine the number of rows for the root of the data grid, and
   determine the number of child rows for each open row. The total
   number of rows is the sum of all these numbers.</dd>

   <dt>To determine the number of rows for the root of the data grid</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> method with a
   <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing the empty path as
   its only argument. The return value is the number of rows at the
   top level of the data grid. If the return value of the method is
   negative, not an integer, or simply not a numeric type, or if the
   method is not defined, then zero must be used instead.</dd>

   <dt>To determine the number of child rows for a row</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> method with a
   <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing the path to the
   row in question. The return value is the number of child rows for
   the given row. If the return value of the method is negative, not
   an integer, or simply not a numeric type, or if the method is not
   defined, then zero must be used instead.</dd>

   <dt>To determine what order to render rows in</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Invoke the <code
    title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">getChildAtPosition()</code>
    method with a <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing
    the path to the parent of the rows that are being rendered as the
    first argument, and the position that is being rendered as the
    second argument. The return value is the index of the row to
    render in that position.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>If the rows are:</p>

     <ol>
      <li> Row "0"
       <ol>
        <li> Row "0,0"
        <li> Row "0,1"

      <li> Row "1"
       <ol>
        <li> Row "1,0"
        <li> Row "1,1"
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>

     <p>...and the <code
    title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">getChildAtPosition()</code>
    method is implemented as follows:</p>

    <pre>function getChildAtPosition(parent, child) {
  // always return the reverse order
  return getRowCount(parent)-child-1;
}</pre>

     <p>...then the rendering would actually be:</p>

     <ol>
      <li> Row "1"
       <ol>
        <li> Row "1,1"
        <li> Row "1,0"
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li> Row "0"
       <ol>
        <li> Row "0,1"
        <li> Row "0,0"
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>

    </div>

    <p>If the return value of the method is negative, larger than the
    number of rows that the <code
    title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> method
    reported for that parent, not an integer, or simply not a numeric
    type, then the entire data grid should be disabled. Similarly, if
    the method returns the same value for two or more different values
    for the second argument (with the same first argument, and
    assuming that the data grid hasn't had relevant update methods
    invoked in the meantime), then the data grid should be
    disabled. Instead of disabling the data grid, the user agent may
    act as if the <code
    title="dom-provider-getChildAtPosition">getChildAtPosition()</code>
    method was not defined on the data provider (thus disabling
    sorting for that data grid, but still letting the user interact
    with the data). If the method is not defined, then the return
    value must be assumed to be the same as the second argument (an
    identity transform; the data is rendered in its natural
    order).</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>To establish what classes apply to a row</dt>

   <dd>Invoke the <code
   title="dom-provider-getRowClasses">getRowClasses()</code> method
   with a <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing the row in
   question, and a <code>DOMTokenList</code> associated with an empty
   string. The tokens contained in the <code>DOMTokenList</code>
   object's underlying string when the method returns represent the
   classes that apply to the row in question. If the method is not
   defined, no classes apply to the row.</dd>

   <dt>To establish whether a row is a data row or a special row</dt>

   <dd>Examine the classes that apply to the row. If the <code
   title="datagrid-row-class-header">header</code> class applies to
   the row, then it is not a data row, it is a subheading. The data
   from the first cell of the row is the text of the subheading, the
   rest of the cells must be ignored. Otherwise, if the <code
   title="datagrid-row-class-separator">separator</code> class applies
   to the row, then in the place of the row, a separator should be
   shown. Otherwise, if the <code
   title="datagrid-row-class-selectable-separator">selectable-separator</code>
   class applies to the row, then the row should be a data row, but
   represented as a separator. (The difference between a <code
   title="datagrid-row-class-separator">separator</code> and a <code
   title="datagrid-row-class-selectable-separator">selectable-separator</code>
   is that the former is not an item that can be actually selected,
   whereas the second can be selected and thus has a context menu that
   applies to it, and so forth.) For both kinds of separator rows, the
   data of the rows' cells must all be ignored. If none of those three
   classes apply then the row is a simple data row.</dd>

  <p>If the data provider ever raises an exception while the
  <code>datagrid</code> is invoking one of its methods, the
  <code>datagrid</code> must act, for the purposes of that particular
  method call, as if the relevant method had not been defined.</p>

  <p>A <code>RowSpecification</code> object <var title="">p</var> with
  <var title="">n</var> path components passed to a method of the data

  title="">i</var> in the range <span>0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var
  title="">i</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var title="">n</var>-1</span>,
  where <var title="">m</var> is the value that was last returned by
  the <code title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code>
  method when it was passed the <code>RowSpecification</code> object
  <var title="">q</var> with <span><var title="">i</var>-1</span>
  items, where <span><var title="">p<sub title=""><var

  <span>0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var title="">i</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var
  title="">n</var>-1</span>, with any changes implied by the update
  methods taken into account.</p>

  <p id="inconsistentDataProvider">The data model is considered
  stable: user agents may assume that subsequent calls to the data
  provider methods will return the same data, until one of the update
  methods is called on the <code>datagrid</code> element. If a user
  agent is returned inconsistent data, for example if the number of
  rows returned by <code
  title="dom-provider-getRowCount">getRowCount()</code> varies in ways
  that do not match the calls made to the update methods, the user
  agent may disable the <code>datagrid</code>. User agents that do not
  disable the <code>datagrid</code> in inconsistent cases must honor
  the most recently returned values.</p>

  <p>User agents may cache returned values so that the data provider
  is never asked for data that could contradict earlier data. User
  agents must not cache the return value of the <code
  title="dom-provider-getRowMenu">getRowMenu</code> method.</p>

  <p>The exact algorithm used to populate the data grid is not defined
  here, since it will differ based on the presentation used. However,
  the behavior of user agents must be consistent with the
  descriptions above. For example, it would be non-conformant for a
  user agent to make cells have both a checkbox and be editable, as
  the descriptions above state that cells that have a checkbox cannot
  be edited.</p> <!-- XXX speaking of which, do we actually want that
  limitation? -->


  <h5>Updating the <code>datagrid</code></h5>

  <p>Whenever the <code title="dom-datagrid-data">data</code>
  attribute is set to a new value, the <code>datagrid</code> must
  clear the current selection, remove all the displayed rows, and plan
  to repopulate itself using the information from the new data
  provider at the earliest opportunity.</p>

  <p>There are a number of update methods that can be invoked on the
  <code>datagrid</code> element to cause it to refresh itself in
  slightly less drastic ways:</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything"><code>updateEverything()</code></dfn>
  method is called, the user agent must repopulate the entire
  <code>datagrid</code>. If the number of rows decreased, the
  selection must be updated appropriately. If the number of rows
  increased, the new rows should be left unselected.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsChanged"><code>updateRowsChanged(<var
  title="">row</var>, <var title="">count</var>)</code></dfn> method
  is called, the user agent must refresh the rendering of the rows
  starting from the row specified by <var title="">row</var>, and
  including the <var title="">count</var> next siblings of the row (or
  as many next siblings as it has, if that is less than <var
  title="">count</var>), including all descendant rows.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsInserted"><code>updateRowsInserted(<var
  title="">row</var>, <var title="">count</var>)</code></dfn> method
  is called, the user agent must assume that <var title="">count</var>
  new rows have been inserted, such that the first new row is
  identified by <var title="">row</var>. The user agent must update
  its rendering and the selection accordingly. The new rows should not
  be selected.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsRemoved"><code>updateRowsRemoved(<var
  title="">row</var>, <var title="">count</var>)</code></dfn> method
  is called, the user agent must assume that <var title="">count</var>
  rows have been removed starting from the row that used to be
  identifier by <var title="">row</var>.  The user agent must update
  its rendering and the selection accordingly.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowChanged"><code>updateRowChanged(<var
  title="">row</var>)</code></dfn> method must be exactly equivalent
  to calling <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsChanged">updateRowsChanged(<var
  title="">row</var>, 1)</code>.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateColumnChanged"><code>updateColumnChanged(<var
  title="">column</var>)</code></dfn> method is called, the user agent
  must refresh the rendering of the specified column <var
  title="">column</var>, for all rows.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-datagrid-updateCellChanged"><code>updateCellChanged(<var
  title="">row</var>, <var title="">column</var>)</code></dfn> method
  is called, the user agent must refresh the rendering of the cell on
  row <var title="">row</var>, in column <var
  title="">column</var>.</p>

  <p>Any effects the update methods have on the
  <code>datagrid</code>'s selection is not considered a change to the
  selection, and must therefore not fire the <code
  title="event-select">select</code> event.</p>

  <p>These update methods should be called only by the data provider,
  or code acting on behalf of the data provider. In particular,
  calling the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsInserted">updateRowsInserted()</code>
  and <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateRowsRemoved">updateRowsRemoved()</code>
  methods without actually inserting or removing rows from the data
  provider is <a href="#inconsistentDataProvider">likely to result in
  inconsistent renderings</a>, and the user agent is likely to disable
  the data grid.</p>


  <h5>Requirements for interactive user agents</h5>

  <p><em>This section only applies to interactive user agents.</em></p>

  <p>If the <code>datagrid</code> element has a <dfn
  title="attr-datagrid-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn>
  attribute, then the user agent must disable the
  <code>datagrid</code>, preventing the user from interacting with it.
  The <code>datagrid</code> element should still continue to update
  itself when the data provider signals changes to the data, though.
  Obviously, conformance requirements stating that
  <code>datagrid</code> elements must react to users in particular
  ways do not apply when one is disabled.</p>

  <p>If <a href="#rowType1">a row is openable</a>, then the user agent
  should offer to the user the option of toggling the row's
  open/closed state. When a row's open/closed state changes, the user
  agent must update the rendering to match the new state.</p>

  <p>If a cell is a cell whose value <a href="#cellType1">can be
  cycled between multiple states</a>, then the user agent should allow
  the user to activate the cell to cycle its value. When the user
  activates this "cycling" behavior of a cell, then the
  <code>datagrid</code> must invoke the data provider's <code
  title="dom-provider-cycleCell">cycleCell()</code> method, with a
  <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing the cell's row as
  the first argument and the cell's column index as the second. The
  <code>datagrid</code> must then act as if the
  <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateCellChanged">updateCellChanged()</code>
  method had been invoked with those same arguments.</p>

  <p>When a cell <a href="#cellType2">has a checkbox</a>, the user
  agent should allow the user to set the checkbox's state. When the
  user changes the state of a checkbox in such a cell, the
  <code>datagrid</code> must invoke the data provider's <code
  title="dom-provider-setCellCheckedState">setCellCheckedState()</code>
  method, with a <code>RowSpecification</code> object representing the
  cell's row as the first argument, the cell's column index as the
  second, and the checkbox's new state as the third. The state should
  be represented by the number 1 if the new state is checked, 0 if the
  new state is unchecked, and &#x2212;1 if the new state is
  indeterminate (which must be possible only if the cell has the <code
  title="datagrid-cell-class-indeterminate">indeterminate</code> class
  set). The <code>datagrid</code> must then act as if the
  <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateCellChanged">updateCellChanged()</code>
  method had been invoked, specifying the same cell.</p>

  <p>If a cell <a href="#cellType2">is editable</a>, the user agent
  should allow the user to edit the data for that cell, and doing so
  must cause the user agent to invoke the <code
  title="dom-provider-editCell">editCell()</code> method of the data
  provider with three arguments: a <code>RowSpecification</code>
  object representing the cell's row, the cell's column's index, and
  the new text entered by the user. The user agent must then act as if
  the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateCellChanged">updateCellChanged()</code>
  method had been invoked, with the same row and column specified.</p>

  <!-- XXXPA <p class="XXX">define actions (performAction(), etc)</p> -->

  <h5>The selection</h5>

  <p><em>This section only applies to interactive user agents. For
  other user agents, the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-selection">selection</code> attribute must
  return null.</em></p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>DataGridSelection</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-count">length</span>;
  [IndexGetter] <span>RowSpecification</span> <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-">item</span>(in unsigned long index);

<!--  void <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-addRange">addRange</span>(in <span>RowSpecification</span> first, in <span>RowSpecification</span> last);
  void <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-removeRange">removeRange</span>(in <span>RowSpecification</span> first, in <span>RowSpecification</span> last);

  void <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-selectAll">selectAll</span>();
  void <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-invert">invert</span>();
  void <span title="dom-DataGridSelection-clear">clear</span>();
};</pre>

  <p>Each <code>datagrid</code> element must keep track of which rows
  are currently selected. Initially no rows are selected, but this can
  be changed via the methods described in this section. <!--XXX
  select-provider-selection The default data provider, for instance,
  changes which rows are selected when it is first initialized.--></p>

  <p>The selection of a <code>datagrid</code> is represented by its
  <dfn title="dom-datagrid-selection"><code>selection</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, which must be a <code>DataGridSelection</code> object.</p>

  <p><code>DataGridSelection</code> objects represent the rows in the
  selection. In the selection the rows must be ordered in the natural
  order of the data provider (and not, e.g., the rendered order). Rows
  that are not rendered because one of their ancestors is closed must
  share the same selection state as their nearest rendered
  ancestor. Such rows are not considered part of the selection for the
  purposes of iterating over the selection.</p>

  <p class="note">This selection API doesn't allow for hidden rows to
  be selected because it is trivial to create a data provider that has
  infinite depth, which would then require the selection to be
  infinite if every row, including every hidden row, was selected.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of rows currently present in the
  selection. This is the <var
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-length">length</var>.</p>

  <p>The object's <span>indices of the supported indexed
  properties</span> are the numbers in the range zero to <span><var
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-length">length</var>-1</span>, unless
  the <var title="dom-DataGridSelection-length">length</var> is zero,
  in which case there are no <span>supported indexed
  properties</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-DataGridSelection-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">index</var>th row in the selection. If the argument is out
  of range (less than zero or greater than the number of selected rows
  minus one), then it must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception. <a href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-isSelected"><code>isSelected()</code></dfn>
  method must return the selected state of the row specified by its
  argument. If the specified row exists and is selected, it must
  return true, otherwise it must return false.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-setSelected"><code>setSelected()</code></dfn>
  method takes two arguments, <var title="">row</var> and <var
  title="">selected</var>. When invoked, it must set the selection
  state of row <var title="">row</var> to selected if <var
  title="">selected</var> is true, and unselected if it is false. If
  <var title="">row</var> is not a row in the data grid, the method
  must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception. If the
  specified row is not rendered because one of its ancestors is
  closed, the method must do nothing.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-selectAll"><code>selectAll()</code></dfn>
  method must mark all the rows in the data grid as selected. After a
  call to <code
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-selectAll">selectAll()</code>, the
  <code title="dom-DataGridSelection-length">length</code> attribute
  will return the number of rows in the data grid, not counting
  children of closed rows.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-invert"><code>invert()</code></dfn>
  method must cause all the rows in the selection that were marked as
  selected to now be marked as not selected, and vice versa.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-clear"><code>clear()</code></dfn>
  method must mark all the rows in the data grid to be marked as not
  selected.  After a call to <code
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-clear">clear()</code>, the <code
  title="dom-DataGridSelection-length">length</code> attribute will
  return zero.</p>

  <p>If the <code>datagrid</code> element has a <dfn
  title="attr-datagrid-multiple"><code>multiple</code></dfn>
  attribute, then the user agent should allow the user to select any
  number of rows (zero or more). If the attribute is not present, then
  the user agent must not allow the user to select more than a single
  row at a time, and selecting another one must unselect all the other
  rows.</p>

  <p class="note">This only applies to the user. Scripts can select
  multiple rows even when the <code
  title="attr-datagrid-multiple">multiple</code> attribute is
  absent.</p>

  <p>Whenever the selection of a <code>datagrid</code> changes,
  whether due to the user interacting with the element, or as a result
  of calls to methods of the <code
  title="dom-datagrid-selection">selection</code> object, a <dfn
  title="event-select"><code>select</code></dfn><!-- XXX check if we
  really should be DFNing this here. It's a DOM3 Core event. What's
  our story going to be regarding events and defining them? --> event
  that bubbles but is not cancelable must be fired on the
  <code>datagrid</code> element. If changes are made to the selection
  via calls to the object's methods during the execution of a
  script<!-- XXX should xref to a better explanation -->, then the
  <code title="event-select">select</code> events must be coalesced
  into one, which must then be fired<!--XXX xref again--> when the
  script execution has completed<!-- XXX xref -->.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>DataGridSelection</code> interface has no
  relation to the <code>Selection</code> interface.</p>


  <h5>Columns and captions</h5>

  <p><em>This section only applies to interactive user agents.</em></p>

  <p>Each <code>datagrid</code> element must keep track of which
  columns are currently being rendered. User agents should initially
  show all the columns except those with the <code
  title="datagrid-column-class-initially-hidden">initially-hidden</code>
  class, but may allow users to hide or show columns. User agents
  should initially display the columns in the order given by the data
  provider, but may allow this order to be changed by the user.</p>

  <p>If columns are not being used, as might be the case if the data
  grid is being presented in an icon view, or if an overview of data
  is being read in an aural context, then the text of the first column
  of each row should be used to represent the row.</p>

  <p>If none of the columns have any captions (i.e. if the data
  provider does not provide a <code
  title="dom-provider-getCaptionText">getCaptionText()</code> method),
  then user agents may avoid showing the column headers at all. This
  may prevent the user from performing actions on the columns (such as
  reordering them, changing the sort column, and so on).</p>

  <p class="note">Whatever the order used for rendering, and
  irrespective of what columns are being shown or hidden, the "first
  column" as referred to in this specification is always the column
  with index zero, and the "last column" is always the column with the
  index one less than the value returned by the <code
  title="dom-provider-getcolumnCount">getColumnCount()</code> method
  of the data provider.</p>

  <p>If <a href="#columnType2">a column is sortable</a>, then the user
  agent should allow the user to request that the data be sorted using
  that column. When the user does so, then the <code>datagrid</code>
  must invoke the data provider's <code
  title="dom-provider-toggleColumnSortState">toggleColumnSortState()</code>
  method, with the column's index as the only argument. The
  <code>datagrid</code> must <em>then</em> act as if the
  <code>datagrid</code>'s <code
  title="dom-datagrid-updateEverything">updateEverything()</code>
  method had been invoked.</p>

  <p>The <code>command</code> element represents a command that the user

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-type"><code>type</code></dfn>
  attribute indicates the kind of command: either a normal command
  with an associated action, or a state or option that can be toggled,
  or a selection of one item from a list of items.</p>

  <p>The attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span> with three

  maps to the <span
  title="attr-command-type-state-command">Command</span> state, the
  <dfn
  title="attr-command-type-keyword-checkbox"><code>checkbox</code></dfn>"
  maps to the <span
  title="attr-command-type-state-checkbox">Checkbox</span>, and the
  "<dfn
  title="attr-command-type-keyword-radio"><code>radio</code></dfn>"
  keyword maps to the <span

  </dl>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-label"><code>label</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the name of the command, as shown to the user.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-title"><code>title</code></dfn>
  attribute gives a hint describing the command, which might be shown
  to the user to help him.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-icon"><code>icon</code></dfn>
  attribute gives a picture that represents the command. If the
  attribute is specified, the attribute's value must contain a
  <span>valid URL</span>. To obtain the <span>absolute URL</span> of
  the icon, the attribute's value must be <span title="resolve a
  url">resolved</span> relative to the element.</p> <!-- this is
  affected by the base URL being changed, so users of this should
  cache the image once they've fetched it once, at least until the
  relative url changes again -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-command-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn> attribute
  is a <span>boolean attribute</span> that, if present, indicates that
  the command is not available in the current state.</p>

  <p class="note">The distinction between <code
  title="attr-command-disabled">disabled</code> and <code
  title="attr-hidden">hidden</code> is subtle. A command should be
  disabled if, in the same context, it could be enabled if only
  certain aspects of the situation were changed. A command should be
  marked as hidden if, in that situation, the command will never be
  enabled. For example, in the context menu for a water faucet, the
  command "open" might be disabled if the faucet is already open, but
  the command "eat" would be marked hidden since the faucet could
  never be eaten.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-command-checked"><code>checked</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span> that, if present,
  indicates that the command is selected. The attribute must be
  omitted unless the <code title="attr-command-type">type</code>
  attribute is in either the <span
  title="attr-command-type-state-checkbox">Checkbox</span> state or
  the <span title="attr-command-type-state-radio">Radio</span>
  state.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-command-radiogroup"><code>radiogroup</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the name of the group of commands that will be
  toggled when the command itself is toggled, for commands whose <code
  title="attr-command-type">type</code> attribute has the value "<code
  title="">radio</code>". The scope of the name is the child list of
  the parent element. The attribute must be omitted unless the <code
  title="attr-command-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-command-type-state-radio">Radio</span> state.</p>

  <p>If the <code>command</code> element is used when <span
  title="menu generation">generating</span> a <span>context
  menu</span>, then the <dfn
  title="attr-command-default"><code>default</code></dfn> attribute
  indicates, if present, that the command is the one that would have
  been invoked if the user had directly activated the menu's subject
  instead of using its context menu. The <code
  title="attr-command-default">default</code> attribute is a
  <span>boolean attribute</span>.  The attribute must be omitted
  unless the <code title="attr-command-type">type</code> attribute is
  in the <span title="attr-command-type-state-command">Command</span>
  state.</p>

   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>bb</code> element represents a user agent command that
  the user can invoke.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-bb-type"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute
  indicates the kind of command. The <code
  title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute is an <span>enumerated
  attribute</span>. The following table lists the keywords and states
  for the attribute &mdash; the keywords in the left column map to the
  states listed in the cell in the second column on the same row as
  the keyword.</p>

  <table>
   <thead> <tr> <th> Keyword <th> State
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td> <dfn title="attr-bb-type-makeapp"><code>makeapp</code></dfn>
     <td> <i title="attr-bb-type-makeapp-state">make application</i>
  </table>

  <p>The <i>missing value default</i> state is the <i
  title="attr-bb-type-null-state">null</i> state.</p>

  <p>Each state has an <i>action</i> and a <i>relevance</i>, defined
  in the following sections.</p>

  <p>When the attribute is in the <dfn
  title="attr-bb-type-null-state"><i>null</i></dfn> state, the
  <i>action</i> is to not do anything, and the <i>relevance</i> is
  unconditionally false.</p>

  <p>A <code>bb</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute is in a state whose
  <i>relevance</i> is true must be enabled. Conversely, a
  <code>bb</code> element whose <code title="attr-bb-type">type</code>
  attribute is in a state whose <i>relevance</i> is false must be
  disabled.</p>

  <p class="note">If a <code>bb</code> element is enabled, it will
  match the <code title="selector-enabled">:enabled</code>
  pseudo-class; otherwise, it will match the <code
  title="selector-disabled">:disabled</code> pseudo-class.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow users to invoke <code>bb</code> elements
  when they are enabled. When a user invokes a <code>bb</code>
  element, its <code title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute's
  state's <i>action</i> must be invoked.</p>

  <p>When the element has no descendant element children and has no
  descendant <span>text node</span> children of non-zero length, the
  element <span>represents</span> a browser button with a
  user-agent-defined icon or text representing the <code
  title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute's state's <i>action</i>
  and <i>relevance</i> (enabled vs disabled). Otherwise, the element
  <span>represents</span> its children.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-bb-type"><code>type</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the content attribute of the
  same name.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-bb-supported"><code>supported</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must return true if the <code
  title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute is in a state other than
  the <i title="attr-bb-type-null-state">null</i> state and the user
  agent supports that state's <i>action</i> (i.e. when the attribute's
  value is one that the user agent recognises and supports), and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-bb-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return true if the element is disabled, and false
  otherwise (i.e. it returns the opposite of the <code
  title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute's state's
  <i>relevance</i>).</p>


  <h5>Browser button types</h5>

  <h6>The <dfn title="attr-bb-type-makeapp-state"><i>make application</i></dfn> state</h6>

  <p>Some user agents support making sites accessible as independent
  applications, as if they were not Web sites at all. The <i
  title="attr-bb-type-makeapp-state">make application</i> state exists
  to allow Web pages to offer themselves to the user as targets for
  this mode of operation.</p>

  <p>The <i>action</i> of the <i
  title="attr-bb-type-makeapp-state">make application</i> state is to
  confirm the user's intent to use the current site in a standalone
  fashion, and, provided the user's intent is confirmed, offer the
  user a way to make the resource identified by <span>the document's
  address</span> available in such a fashion.</p>

  <p class="warning">The confirmation is needed because it is
  relatively easy to trick users into activating buttons. The
  confirmation could, e.g. take the form of asking the user where to
  "save" the application, or non-modal information panel that is
  clearly from the user agent and gives the user the opportunity to
  drag an icon to their system's application launcher.</p>

  <p>The <i>relevance</i> of the <i
  title="attr-bb-type-makeapp-state">make application</i> state is
  false if the user agent is already handling the site in such a
  fashion, or if the user agent doesn't support making the site
  available in that fashion, and true otherwise.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a few links are listed on an
   application's page, to allow the user perform certain actions,
   including making the application standalone:</p>

   <pre>&lt;menu>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="settings.html" onclick="panels.show('settings')">Settings&lt;/a>
 &lt;li>&lt;bb type="makeapp">Download standalone application&lt;/bb>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="help.html" onclick="panels.show('help')">Help&lt;/a>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="logout.html" onclick="panels.show('logout')">Sign out&lt;/a>
&lt;/menu></pre>

   <p>With the following stylesheet, it could be make to look like a
   single line of text with vertical bars separating the options, with
   the "make app" option disappearing when it's not supported or
   relevant:</p>

   <pre>menu li { display: none; }
menu li:enabled { display: inline; }
menu li:not(:first-child)::before { content: ' | '; }</pre>

   <p>This could look like this:</p>

   <p><img src="images/sample-makeapp.png" alt="&quot;Settings&nbsp;|&nbsp;Download&nbsp;standalone&nbsp;application&nbsp;|&nbsp;Help&nbsp;|&nbsp;Sign&nbsp;out&quot;"></p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example shows another way to do the same thing as
   the previous one, this time not relying on CSS support to hide the
   "make app" link if it doesn't apply:</p>

   <pre>&lt;menu>
 &lt;a href="settings.html" onclick="panels.show('settings')">Settings&lt;/a> |
 &lt;bb type="makeapp" id="makeapp"> &lt;/bb>
 &lt;a href="help.html" onclick="panels.show('help')">Help&lt;/a> |
 &lt;a href="logout.html" onclick="panels.show('logout')">Sign out&lt;/a>
&lt;/menu>
&lt;script>
 var bb = document.getElementById('makeapp');
 if (bb.supported &amp;&amp; bb.enabled) {
   bb.parentNode.nextSibling.textContent = ' | ';
   bb.textContent = 'Download standalone application';
 } else {
   bb.parentNode.removeChild(bb);
 }
&lt;/script></pre>

  <h5><dfn>Building menus and tool bars</dfn></h5>

  <p>A menu (or tool bar) consists of a list of zero or more of the
  following components:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li><span title="concept-command">Commands</span>, which can be marked as default commands</li>
   <li>Separators</li>
   <li>Other menus (which allows the list to be nested)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The list corresponding to a particular <code>menu</code> element
  is built by iterating over its child nodes. For each child node in
  <span>tree order</span>, the required behavior depends on what the
  node is, as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>An element that <span title="concept-command">defines a command</span></dt>

   <dd>Append the command to the menu, respecting its <span
   title="concept-facet">facets</span><!-- XXX be explicit about what
   this means for each facet -->. If the element is a
   <code>command</code> element with a <code
   title="attr-command-default">default</code> attribute, mark the
   command as being a default command.</dd> <!-- XXX if there's an
   Icon facet for the command, it should be <span
   title="fetch">fetched</span>, and then that image should be
   associated with the command, such that each command only has its
   image fetched once, to prevent changes to the base URL from having
   effects after the image has been fetched once. (no need to resolve
   the Icon facet, it's an absolute URL) -->


   <dt>An <code>hr</code> element</dt>
   <dt>An <code>option</code> element that has a <code
   title="attr-option-value">value</code> attribute set to the empty
   string, and has a <code
   title="attr-option-disabled">disabled</code> attribute, and whose
   <code>textContent</code> consists of a string of one or more
   hyphens (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS)</dt>

   <dd>Append a separator to the menu.</dd>


   <dt>An <code>li</code> element</dt>

   <dd>Iterate over the children of the <code>li</code> element.</dd>


   <dt>A <code>menu</code> element with no <code title="attr-menu-label">label</code> attribute</dt>
   <dt>A <code>select</code> element</dt>

   <dd>Append a separator to the menu, then iterate over the children
   of the <code>menu</code> or <code>select</code> element, then
   append another separator.</dd>


   <dt>A <code>menu</code> element with a <code title="attr-menu-label">label</code> attribute</dt>
   <dt>An <code>optgroup</code> element</dt>

   <dd>Append a submenu to the menu, using the value of the element's
   <code title="">label</code> attribute as the label of the menu. The
   submenu must be constructed by taking the element and creating a
   new menu for it using the complete process described in this
   section.</dd>


   <dt>Any other node</dt>

   <dd><span>Ignore</span> the node.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="XXX">We should support <code>label</code> in the
  algorithm above -- just iterate through the contents like with
  <code>li</code>, to support <code>input</code> elements in
  <code>label</code> elements. Also, <code>optgroup</code> elements
  without labels should be ignored (maybe? or at least should say they
  have no label so that they are dropped below), and
  <code>select</code> elements inside <code>label</code> elements may
  need special processing.</p>

  <p>Once all the nodes have been processed as described above, the
  user agent must the post-process the menu as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Any menu item with no label, or whose label is the empty string, must be removed.</li>

   <li>Any sequence of two or more separators in a row must be collapsed to a single separator.</li>

   <li>Any separator at the start or end of the menu must be removed.</li>

  </ol>


  <h5><dfn>Context menus</dfn></h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-contextmenu"><code>contextmenu</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the element's <span title="context menus">context
  menu</span>. The value must be the ID of a <code>menu</code> element
  in the DOM. If the node that would be obtained by the invoking the
  <code>getElementById()</code> method using the attribute's value as
  the only argument is null or not a <code>menu</code> element, then
  the element has no assigned context menu. Otherwise, the element's
  assigned context menu is the element so identified.</p>

  <p>When an element's context menu is requested (e.g. by the user
  right-clicking the element, or pressing a context menu key), the UA
  must <span>fire a <code title="">contextmenu</code> event</span> on
  the element for which the menu was requested.</p>

  <p class="note">Typically, therefore, the firing of the <code
  title="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event will be the
  default action of a <code title="mouseup">mouseup</code> or <code
  title="event-keyup">keyup</code> event. The exact sequence of events
  is UA-dependent, as it will vary based on platform conventions.</p>

  <p>The default action of the <code
  title="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> event depends on
  whether the element has a context menu assigned (using the <code
  title="attr-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> attribute) or not. If it
  does not, the default action must be for the user agent to show its
  default context menu, if it has one.</p>

  <p class="XXX">Context menus should inherit (so clicking on a
  span in a paragraph with a context menu should show the menu).</p>

  <p>If the element <em>does</em> have a context menu assigned, then
  the user agent must <span>fire a <code title="">show</code>
  event</span> on the relevant <code>menu</code> element.</p>

  <p>The default action of <em>this</em> event is that the user agent
  must show a context menu <span title="building menus and tool
  bars">built</span> from the <code>menu</code> element.</p>

  <p>The user agent may also provide access to its default context
  menu, if any, with the context menu shown. For example, it could
  merge the menu items from the two menus together, or provide the
  page's context menu as a submenu of the default menu.</p>

  <p>If the user dismisses the menu without making a selection,
  nothing in particular happens.</p>

  <p>If the user selects a menu item that represents a <span
  title="concept-commands">command</span>, then the UA must invoke
  that command's <span title="command-facet-Action">Action</span>.</p>

  <p>Context menus must not, while being shown, reflect changes in the
  DOM; they are constructed as the default action of the <code
  title="event-show">show</code> event and must remain like that until
  dismissed.</p>

  <p>User agents may provide means for bypassing the context menu
  processing model, ensuring that the user can always access the UA's
  default context menus. For example, the user agent could handle
  right-clicks that have the Shift key depressed in such a way that it
  does not fire the <code title="event-contextmenu">contextmenu</code>
  event and instead always shows the default context menu.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-contextMenu"><code>contextMenu</code></dfn>
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the <code
  title="attr-contextmenu">contextmenu</code> content attribute.</p>


  <h5><dfn>Tool bars</dfn></h5>

  <p>When a <code>menu</code> element has a <code
  title="attr-menu-type">type</code> attribute in the <span
  title="tool bar state">tool bar</span> state, then the user agent
  must <span title="building menus and tool bars">build</span> the
  menu for that <code>menu</code> element, and use the result in the
  rendering.</p>

  <p>The user agent must reflect changes made to the
  <code>menu</code>'s DOM, by immediately <span title="building menus
  and tool bars">rebuilding</span> the menu.</p>



  <h4 id="commands">Commands</h4>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-command">command</dfn> is the abstraction
  behind menu items, buttons, and links. Once a command is defined,
  other parts of the interface can refer to the same command, allowing
  many access points to a single feature to share aspects such as the
  disabled state.</p>

  <p id="facets">Commands are defined to have the following
  <dfn title="concept-facet">facets</dfn>:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Type">Type</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The kind of command: "command", meaning it is a normal command;
   "radio", meaning that triggering the command will, amongst other
   things, set the <span title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked
   State</span> to true (and probably uncheck some other commands); or
   "checkbox", meaning that triggering the command will, amongst other
   things, toggle the value of the <span
   title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-ID">ID</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The name of the command, for referring to the command from the
   markup or from script. If a command has no ID, it is an
   <dfn>anonymous command</dfn>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Label">Label</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The name of the command as seen by the user.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</dfn></dt>

   <dd>A helpful or descriptive string that can be shown to the
   user.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</dfn></dt>

   <dd>An <span>absolute URL</span> identifying a graphical image that
   represents the action. A command might not have an Icon.</dd> <!--
   changing base URLs might change the icon -->

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Whether the command is hidden or not (basically, whether it
   should be shown in menus).</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled State</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Whether the command is relevant and can be triggered or not.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Whether the command is checked or not.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Action">Action</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The actual effect that triggering the command will have. This
   could be a scripted event handler, a <span>URL</span> to which to
   <span>navigate</span>, or a form submission.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="command-facet-Triggers">Triggers</dfn></dt>

   <dd>The list of elements that can trigger the command. The element
   defining a command is always in the list of elements that can
   trigger the command. For anonymous commands, only the element
   defining the command is on the list, since other elements have no
   way to refer to it.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Commands are represented by elements in the DOM. Any element that
  can define a command also implements the <code

  <p class="XXX">Actually even better would be to just mix it
  straight into those interfaces somehow.</p>

  <pre class="idl">[NoInterfaceObject] interface <dfn title="command-ro">Command</dfn> {<!--

  <p>The <code title="command-ro">Command</code> interface is
  implemented by any element capable of defining a command. (If an
  element can define a command, its definition will list this
  interface explicitly.) All the attributes of the <code
  title="command-ro">Command</code> interface are read-only. Elements
  implementing this interface may implement other interfaces that have
  attributes with identical names but that are mutable; in bindings
  that flatten all supported interfaces on the object, the mutable
  attributes must shadow the readonly attributes defined in the <code
  title="command-ro">Command</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-command-ro-commandType"><code>commandType</code></dfn>
  attribute must return a string whose value is either "<code
  title="">command</code>", "<code title="">radio</code>", or "<code
  title="">checked</code>", depending on whether the <span
  title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> of the command defined by the
  element is "command", "radio", or "checked" respectively. If the
  element does not define a command, it must return null.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-id"><code>id</code></dfn> attribute
  must return the command's <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span>,
  or null if the element does not define a command or defines an
  <span>anonymous command</span>. This attribute will be shadowed by
  the <code title="dom-id">id</code> DOM attribute on the
  <code>HTMLElement</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-label"><code>label</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the command's <span
  title="command-facet-Label">Label</span>, or null if the element
  does not define a command or does not specify a <span
  title="command-facet-Label">Label</span>. This attribute will be
  shadowed by the <code title="">label</code> DOM attribute on
  <code>option</code> and <code>command</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-title"><code>title</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the command's <span
  title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span>, or null if the element does
  not define a command or does not specify a <span
  title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span>. This attribute will be
  shadowed by the <code title="dom-title">title</code> DOM attribute
  on the <code>HTMLElement</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-icon"><code>icon</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the <span>absolute URL</span> of the command's
  <span title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span>. If the element does
  not specify an icon, or if the element does not define a command,
  then the attribute must return null. This attribute will be shadowed
  by the <code title="dom-command-icon">icon</code> DOM attribute on
  <code>command</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-hidden"><code>hidden</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if the command's <span
  title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span> is that the
  command is hidden, and false if it is that the command is not
  hidden. If the element does not define a command, the attribute must
  return false. This attribute will be shadowed by the <code
  title="dom-hidden">hidden</code> DOM attribute on the
  <code>HTMLElement</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-command-ro-disabled"><code>disabled</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if the command's <span
  title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled State</span> is that
  the command is disabled, and false if the command is not
  disabled. This attribute is not affected by the command's <span
  title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span>. If the
  element does not define a command, the attribute must return
  false. This attribute will be shadowed by the <code
  title="">disabled</code> attribute on <code>button</code>,
  <code>input</code>, <code>option</code>, and <code>command</code>
  elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-command-ro-checked"><code>checked</code></dfn> attribute
  must return true if the command's <span
  title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span> is that the
  command is checked, and false if it is that the command is not
  checked. If the element does not define a command, the attribute
  must return false. This attribute will be shadowed by the <code
  title="">checked</code> attribute on <code>input</code> and
  <code>command</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-command-ro-click"><code>click()</code></dfn>
  method must trigger the <span
  title="command-facet-Action">Action</span> for the command. If the
  element does not define a command, this method must do nothing. This
  method will be shadowed by the <code
  title="dom-click">click()</code> method on <span>HTML
  elements</span>, and is included only for completeness.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-command-ro-triggers"><code>triggers</code></dfn>
  attribute must return a list containing the elements that can
  trigger the command (the command's <span
  title="command-facet-Triggers">Triggers</span>). The list must be
  <span>live</span>. While the element does not define a command, the
  list must be empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-commands"><code>commands</code></dfn> attribute
  of the document's <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface must return an
  <code>HTMLCollection</code> rooted at the <code>Document</code>
  node, whose filter matches only elements that define commands and
  have IDs.</p>

  <p>The following elements can define commands: <code
  title="a-command">a</code>, <code
  title="button-command">button</code>, <code
  title="input-command">input</code>, <code
  title="option-command">option</code>, <code
  title="command-element">command</code>, <code
  title="bb-command">bb</code>.</p>


  <h5><dfn title="a-command">Using the <code>a</code> element to define a command</dfn></h5>

  <p>An <code>a</code> element with an <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute <span
  title="concept-command">defines a command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> of the command
  is "command".</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span> of the command is
  the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute of the
  element, if the attribute is present and not empty. Otherwise the
  command is an <span>anonymous command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> of the command
  is the string given by the element's <code>textContent</code> DOM
  attribute.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> of the command
  is the value of the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute
  of the element. If the attribute is not present, the <span
  title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> is the empty string.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span> of the command
  is the <span>absolute URL</span> obtained from <span title="resolve
  a url">resolving</span> the value of the <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute of the first
  <code>img</code> element descendant of the element, relative to that
  element, if there is such an element and resolving its attribute is
  successful. Otherwise, there is no <span
  title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span> for the command.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span>
  of the command is true (hidden) if the element has a <code
  title="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute, and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled
  State</span> facet of the command is always false. (The command is
  always enabled.)</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span>
  of the command is always false. (The command is never checked.)</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Action">Action</span> of the
  command is to <span title="fire a click event">fire a <code

  <h5><dfn title="button-command">Using the <code>button</code> element to define a command</dfn></h5>

  <p>A <code>button</code> element always <span

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled

  <h5><dfn title="input-command">Using the <code>input</code> element to define a command</dfn></h5>

  <p>An <code>input</code> element whose <code

  "command" otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span> of the command is
  the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute of the
  element, if the attribute is present and not empty. Otherwise the
  command is an <span>anonymous command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> of the command
  depends on the Type of the command:</p>

  <p>If the <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> is "command",
  then it is the string given by the <code
  title="attr-input-value">value</code> attribute, if any, and a
  <span>UA-dependent value</span><!-- XXX xref--> that the UA uses to
  label the button itself if the attribute is absent.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> is

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> of the command
  is the value of the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute
  of the <code>input</code> element. If the attribute is not present, the
  <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> is the empty
  string.</p>

  <p>There is no <span title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span> for the

  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span>
  of the command is true if the command is of <span
  title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> "radio" or "checkbox" and the
  element is <span title="concept-fe-checked">checked</span>
  attribute, and false otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Action">Action</span> of the
  command is to <span title="fire a click event">fire a <code

  <h5><dfn title="option-command">Using the <code>option</code> element to define a command</dfn></h5>

  <p>An <code>option</code> element with an ancestor

  "checkbox" if it does.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span> of the command is
  the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute of the
  element, if the attribute is present and not empty. Otherwise the
  command is an <span>anonymous command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> of the command

  title="concept-command">defines a command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Type">Type</span> of the command
  is "command".</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-ID">ID</span> of the command is
  the value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code> attribute of the
  element, if the attribute is present and not empty. Otherwise the
  command is an <span>anonymous command</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Label">Label</span> of the command
  is the string given by the element's <code>textContent</code> DOM
  attribute, if that is not the empty string, or a user-agent-defined
  string appropriate for the <code>bb</code> element's <code
  title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute's state.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> of the command
  is the value of the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute
  of the element. If the attribute is not present, the <span
  title="command-facet-Hint">Hint</span> is a user-agent-defined
  string appropriate for the <code>bb</code> element's <code
  title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute's state.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span> of the command
  is the <span>absolute URL</span> obtained from <span title="resolve
  a url">resolving</span> the value of the <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute of the first
  <code>img</code> element descendant of the element, relative to that
  element, if there is such an element and resolving its attribute is
  successful. Otherwise, the <span
  title="command-facet-Icon">Icon</span> is a user-agent-defined image
  appropriate for the <code>bb</code> element's <code
  title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute's state.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span>
  facet of the command is true (hidden) if the <code>bb</code>
  element's <code title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute's state
  is <i title="attr-bb-type-null-state">null</i> or if the element has
  a <code title="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute, and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled
  State</span> facet of the command is true if the <code>bb</code>
  element's <code title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute's state's
  <i>relevance</i> is false, and true otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-CheckedState">Checked State</span>
  of the command is always false. (The command is never checked.)</p>

  <p>The <span title="command-facet-Action">Action</span> of the
  command is to perform the <i>action</i> of the <code>bb</code>
  element's <code title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute's
  state.</p>



  <h3>Miscellaneous elements</h3>

  <h4>The <dfn><code>legend</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Categories</dt>
   <dd>None.</dd>
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>
   <dd>As the first child of a <code>fieldset</code> element.</dd>
   <dd>As the first child of a <code>details</code> element.</dd>
   <dd>As a child of a <code>figure</code> element, if there are no other <code>legend</code> element children of that element.</dd>

  readonly attribute <span>HTMLFormElement</span> <span title="dom-legend-form">form</span>;
};</pre>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>legend</code> element <span>represents</span> a title or explanatory
  caption for the rest of the contents of the <code>legend</code>
  element's parent element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-legend-form"><code>form</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute's behavior depends on whether the <code>legend</code>
  element is in a <code>fieldset</code> element or not. If the
  <code>legend</code> has a <code>fieldset</code> element as its
  parent, then the <code title="dom-legend-form">form</code> DOM
  attribute must return the same value as the <code
  title="dom-fae-form">form</code> DOM attribute on that
  <code>fieldset</code> element. Otherwise, it must return null.</p>


  <h4>The <dfn><code>div</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <dl class="element">
   <dt>Categories</dt>
   <dd><span>Flow content</span>.</dd>
   <dt>Contexts in which this element may be used:</dt>

   <dd><span>Global attributes</span></dd>
   <dt>DOM interface:</dt>
   <dd>Uses <code>HTMLElement</code>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code>div</code> element has no special meaning at all. It
  <span>represents</span> its children. It can be used with the <code
  title="attr-class">class</code>, <code
  title="attr-lang">lang</code>/<code
  title="attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</code>, and <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attributes to mark up semantics
  common to a group of consecutive elements.</p>

  <p class="XXX">Allowing <code>div</code> elements to contain
  phrasing content makes it easy for authors to abuse
  <code>div</code>, using it with the <code>class=""</code> attribute
  to the point of not having any other elements in the markup. This is
  a disaster from an accessibility point of view, and it would be nice
  if we could somehow make such pages non-compliant without preventing
  people from using <code>div</code>s as the extension mechanism that
  they are, to handle things the spec can't otherwise do (like making
  new widgets).</p>



  <h3>Matching HTML elements using selectors</h3>

  <p>There are a number of dynamic selectors that can be used with
  HTML. This section defines when these selectors match HTML
  elements.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="selector-link"><code>:link</code></dfn></dt>
   <dt><dfn title="selector-visited"><code>:visited</code></dfn></dt>

    title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute, all
    <code>area</code> elements that have an <code
    title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute, and all
    <code>link</code> elements that have an <code
    title="attr-link-href">href</code> attribute, must match one of
    <code title="selector-link">:link</code> and <code
    title="selector-visited">:visited</code>.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><dfn title="selector-active"><code>:active</code></dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The <code title="selector-active">:active</code> pseudo-class
    must match the following elements between the time the user begins
    to activate the element and the time the users stops activating
    the element:</p>

    <ul>

     <li><code>a</code> elements that have an <code
     title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute</li>

     <li><code>area</code> elements that have an <code
     title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute</li>

     <li><code>link</code> elements that have an <code
     title="attr-link-href">href</code> attribute</li>

     <li><code>bb</code> elements whose <code
     title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute is in a state whose
     <i>relevance</i> is true</li>

     <li><code>button</code> elements that are not <span

     <li>any other element, if it is <span>focusable</span></li>

    </ul>

    <p class="example">For example, if the user is using a keyboard to
    push a <code>button</code> element by pressing the space bar, the
    element would match this pseudo-class in between the time that the
    element received the <code title="event-keydown">keydown</code>

  <h2 id="browsers">Web browsers</h2>

  <p>This section describes features that apply most directly to Web
  browsers. Having said that, unless specified elsewhere, the
  requirements defined in this section <em>do</em> apply to all user
  agents, whether they are Web browsers or not.</p>


  <h3 id="windows">Browsing contexts</h3>

  <p>A <dfn>browsing context</dfn> is an environment in which
  <code>Document</code> objects are presented to the user. At any
  time, one <code>Document</code> is designated the <dfn>active
  document</dfn>. The collection of <code>Document</code>s is the
  <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>session history</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>browsing context</span> has a corresponding
  <code>WindowProxy</code> object.</p>

  <p>Each <code>Document</code> has a collection of one or more <span
  title="view">views</span>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>view</dfn> is a user agent interface tied to a particular
  media used for the presentation of a particular
  <code>Document</code> object in some media. A view may be
  interactive. Each view is represented by an
  <code>AbstractView</code> object. <a
  href="#refsDOM2VIEWS">[DOM2VIEWS]</a></p>

  <p>The main <span>view</span> through which a user primarily
  interacts with a user agent is the <dfn>default view</dfn>. The
  <code>AbstractView</code> object that represents this view must also
  implement the <code>Window</code> interface, and is referred to as
  the <code>Document</code>'s <code>Window</code> object.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>default view</span> of a
  <code>Document</code> is given by the <code
  title="">defaultView</code> attribute on the <code>Document</code>
  object's <code>DocumentView</code> interface. <a
  href="#refsDOM3VIEWS">[DOM3VIEWS]</a></p>

  <p class="note">The <code title="">document</code> attribute of an
  <code>AbstractView</code> object representing a <span>view</span>
  gives the view's corresponding <code>Document</code> object. <a
  href="#refsDOM2VIEWS">[DOM2VIEWS]</a></p>

  <p class="note">Events that use the <code>UIEvent</code> interface
  are related to a specific <span>view</span> (the view in which the
  event happened); the <code>AbstractView</code> of that view is given
  in the event object's <code title="">view</code> attribute. <a
  href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p class="note">A typical Web browser has one obvious
  <span>view</span> per <code>Document</code>: the browser's window
  (screen media). This is typically the <span>default view</span>. If
  a page is printed, however, a second view becomes evident, that of
  the print media. The two views always share the same underlying
  <code>Document</code> object, but they have a different presentation
  of that object. A speech browser might have a different
  <span>default view</span>, using the speech media.</p>

  <p class="note">A <code>Document</code> does not necessarily have a
  <span>browsing context</span> associated with it. In particular,
  data mining tools are likely to never instantiate browsing
  contexts.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> can have a <dfn>creator browsing
  context</dfn>, the <span>browsing context</span> that was
  responsible for its creation. Unless otherwise specified, a
  <span>browsing context</span> has no <span>creator browsing
  context</span>.</p>

  <p>If a <span>browsing context</span> <var title="">A</var> has a
  <span>creator browsing context</span>, then the
  <code>Document</code> that was the <span>active document</span> of
  that <span>creator browsing context</span> at the time <var
  title="">A</var> was created is the <dfn>creator
  <code>Document</code></dfn>.</p>

  <p>When a <span>browsing context</span> is first created, it must be
  created with a single <code>Document</code> in its session history,
  whose <span title="the document's address">address</span> is
  <code>about:blank</code>, which is marked as being an <span
  title="HTML documents">HTML document</span>, and whose <span
  title="document's character encoding">character encoding</span> is
  UTF-8. The <code>Document</code> must have a single child
  <code>html</code> node, which itself has a single child
  <code>body</code> node. If the <span>browsing context</span> is
  created specifically to be immediately navigated, then that initial
  navigation will have <span>replacement enabled</span>.</p>

  <p id="about-blank-origin">The <span>origin</span> of the
  <code>about:blank</code> <code>Document</code> is set when the
  <code>Document</code> is created. If the new <span>browsing
  context</span> has a <span>creator browsing context</span>, then the
  <span>origin</span> of the <code>about:blank</code>
  <code>Document</code> is the <span>origin</span> of the
  <span>creator <code>Document</code></span>. Otherwise, the
  <span>origin</span> of the <code>about:blank</code>
  <code>Document</code> is a globally unique identifier assigned when
  the new <span>browsing context</span> is created.</p>


  <h4>Nested browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>Certain elements (for example, <code>iframe</code> elements) can
  instantiate further <span title="browsing context">browsing
  contexts</span>. These are called <dfn title="nested browsing
  context">nested browsing contexts</dfn>. If a browsing context <var
  title="">P</var> has an element <var title="">E</var> in one of its
  <code>Document</code>s <var title="">D</var> that nests another
  browsing context <var title="">C</var> inside it, then <var
  title="">P</var> is said to be the <dfn>parent browsing
  context</dfn> of <var title="">C</var>, <var title="">C</var> is
  said to be a <dfn>child browsing context</dfn> of <var
  title="">P</var>, <var title="">C</var> is said to be <dfn
  title="browsing context nested through">nested through</dfn> <var
  title="">D</var>, and <var title="">E</var> is said to be the
  <dfn>browsing context container</dfn> of <var title="">C</var>.</p>

  <p>A browsing context <var title="">A</var> is said to be an
  ancestor of a browsing context <var title="">B</var> if there exists
  a browsing context <var title="">A'</var> that is a <span>child
  browsing context</span> of <var title="">A</var> and that is itself
  an ancestor of <var title="">B</var>, or if there is a browsing
  context <var title="">P</var> that is a <span>child browsing
  context</span> of <var title="">A</var> and that is the <span>parent
  browsing context</span> of <var title="">B</var>.</p>

  <p>The browsing context with no <span>parent browsing context</span>
  is the <dfn>top-level browsing context</dfn> of all the browsing
  contexts <span title="nested browsing context">nested</span> within
  it (either directly or indirectly through other nested browsing
  contexts).</p>

  <p>The transitive closure of <span title="parent browsing
  context">parent browsing contexts</span> for a <span>nested browsing
  context</span> gives the list of <dfn title="ancestor browsing
  context">ancestor browsing contexts</dfn>.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> is said to be <dfn>fully active</dfn>
  when it is the <span>active document</span> of its <span>browsing
  context</span>, and either its browsing context is a <span>top-level
  browsing context</span>, or the <code>Document</code> <span
  title="browsing context nested through">through which</span> that
  browsing context is <span title="nested browsing
  context">nested</span> is itself <span>fully active</span>.</p>

  <p>Because they are nested through an element, <span title="child
  browsing context">child browsing contexts</span> are always tied to
  a specific <code>Document</code> in their <span>parent browsing
  context</span>. User agents must not allow the user to interact with
  <span title="child browsing context">child browsing contexts</span>
  of elements that are in <code>Document</code>s that are not
  themselves <span>fully active</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>nested browsing context</span> can have a <span>seamless
  browsing context flag</span> set, if it is embedded through an
  <code>iframe</code> element with a <code
  title="attr-iframe-seamless">seamless</code> attribute.</p>


  <h5>Navigating nested browsing contexts in the DOM</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-top"><code>top</code></dfn> DOM attribute on
  the <code>Window</code> object of a <code>Document</code> in a
  <span>browsing context</span> <var title="">b</var> must return the
  <code>WindowProxy</code> object of its <span>top-level browsing
  context</span> (which would be its own <code>WindowProxy</code>
  object if it was a <span>top-level browsing context</span>
  itself).</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-parent"><code>parent</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute on the <code>Window</code> object of a
  <code>Document</code> in a <span>browsing context</span> <var
  title="">b</var> must return the <code>WindowProxy</code> object of
  the <span>parent browsing context</span>, if there is one (i.e. if
  <var title="">b</var> is a <span>child browsing context</span>), or
  the <code>WindowProxy</code> object of the <span>browsing
  context</span> <var title="">b</var> itself, otherwise (i.e. if it
  is a <span>top-level browsing context</span>).</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-frameElement"><code>frameElement</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute on the <code>Window</code> object of a
  <code>Document</code> <var title="">d</var>, on getting, must run
  the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If <var title="">d</var> is not a <code>Document</code> in a
   <span>child browsing context</span>, return null and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>parent browsing context</span>'s <span>active
   document</span> does not have the <span>same</span> <span>effective
   script origin</span> as the script that is accessing the <code
   title="dom-frameElement">frameElement</code> attribute, then throw
   a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, return the <span>browsing context
   container</span> for <var title="">b</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>



  <h4>Auxiliary browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>It is possible to create new browsing contexts that are related
  to a <span>top level browsing context</span> without being nested
  through an element. Such browsing contexts are called <dfn
  title="auxiliary browsing context">auxiliary browsing
  contexts</dfn>. Auxiliary browsing contexts are always <span
  title="top-level browsing context">top-level browsing
  contexts</span>.</p>

  <p>An <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> has an <dfn>opener
  browsing context</dfn>, which is the <span>browsing context</span>
  from which the <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> was created,
  and it has a <dfn>furthest ancestor browsing context</dfn>, which is
  the <span>top-level browsing context</span> of the <span>opener
  browsing context</span> when the <span>auxiliary browsing
  context</span> was created.</p>


  <h5>Navigating auxiliary browsing contexts in the DOM</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-opener"><code>opener</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute on the <code>Window</code> object must return the
  <code>WindowProxy</code> object of the <span>browsing context</span>
  from which the current <span>browsing context</span> was created
  (its <span>opener browsing context</span>), if there is one and it
  is still available.</p>




  <h4>Secondary browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>User agents may support <dfn title="secondary browsing
  context">secondary browsing contexts</dfn>, which are <span
  title="browsing context">browsing contexts</span> that form part of
  the user agent's interface, apart from the main content area.</p>


  <h4>Security</h4>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> <var title="">A</var> is
  <dfn>allowed to navigate</dfn> a second <span>browsing
  context</span> <var title="">B</var> if one of the following
  conditions is true:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Either the <span>origin</span> of the <span>active
   document</span> of <var title="">A</var> is the <span title="same
   origin">same</span> as the <span>origin</span> of the <span>active
   document</span> of <var title="">B</var>, or</li>

   <li>The browsing context <var title="">A</var> is a <span>nested
   browsing context</span> and its <span>top-level browsing
   context</span> is <var title="">B</var>, or</li>

   <li>The browsing context <var title="">B</var> is an
   <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> and <var title="">A</var>
   is <span>allowed to navigate</span> <var title="">B</var>'s
   <span>opener browsing context</span>, or</li>

   <li>The browsing context <var title="">B</var> is not a
   <span>top-level browsing context</span>, but there exists an
   <span>ancestor browsing context</span> of <var title="">B</var>
   whose <span>active document</span> has the <span title="same
   origin">same</span> <span>origin</span> as the <span>active
   document</span> of <var title="">A</var> (possibly in fact being
   <var title="">A</var> itself).</li>

  </ul>


  <h4>Groupings of browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>Each <span>browsing context</span> is defined as having a list of
  zero or more <dfn>directly reachable browsing contexts</dfn>. These
  are:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>All the <span>browsing context</span>'s <span title="child
   browsing context">child browsing contexts</span>.</li>

   <li>The <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>parent browsing
   context</span>.</li>

   <li>All the <span title="browsing context">browsing contexts</span>
   that have the <span>browsing context</span> as their <span>opener
   browsing context</span>.</li>

   <li>The <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>opener browsing
   context</span>.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The transitive closure of all the <span title="browsing
  context">browsing contexts</span> that are <span>directly reachable
  browsing contexts</span> forms a <dfn>unit of related browsing
  contexts</dfn>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>unit of related browsing contexts</span> is then
  further divided into the smallest number of groups such that every
  member of each group has an <span>effective script origin</span>
  that, through appropriate manipulation of the <code
  title="dom-document-domain">document.domain</code> attribute, could
  be made to be the same as other members of the group, but could not
  be made the same as members of any other group. Each such group is a
  <dfn>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</dfn>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>unit of related similar-origin browsing
  contexts</span> can have a <dfn>first script</dfn> which is used to
  obtain, amongst other things, the <span>script's base URL</span> to
  <span title="resolve a url">resolve</span> relative <span
  title="URL">URLs</span> used in scripts running in that <span>unit
  of related similar-origin browsing contexts</span>. Initially there
  is no <span>first script</span>.</p>



  <h4>Browsing context names</h4>

  <p>Browsing contexts can have a <dfn>browsing context name</dfn>. By
  default, a browsing context has no name (its name is not set).</p>

  <p>A <dfn>valid browsing context name</dfn> is any string with at
  least one character that does not start with a U+005F LOW LINE
  character. (Names starting with an underscore are reserved for
  special keywords.)</p>

  <p>A <dfn>valid browsing context name or keyword</dfn> is any string
  that is either a <span>valid browsing context name</span> or that is
  an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for one of: <code
  title="">_blank</code>, <code title="">_self</code>, <code
  title="">_parent</code>, or <code title="">_top</code>.</p>

  <p><dfn>The rules for choosing a browsing context given a browsing
  context name</dfn> are as follows. The rules assume that they are
  being applied in the context of a <span>browsing context</span>.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the given browsing context name is the empty string or
   <code title="">_self</code>, then the chosen browsing context must
   be the current one.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the given browsing context name is <code
   title="">_parent</code>, then the chosen browsing context must be
   the <span><em>parent</em> browsing context</span> of the current
   one, unless there isn't one, in which case the chosen browsing
   context must be the current browsing context.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the given browsing context name is <code
   title="">_top</code>, then the chosen browsing context must be the
   most <span>top-level browsing context</span> of the current
   one.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the given browsing context name is not <code
    title="">_blank</code> and there exists a browsing context whose
    <span title="browsing context name">name</span> is the same as the
    given browsing context name, and the current browsing context is
    <span>allowed to navigate</span> that browsing context, and the
    user agent determines that the two browsing contexts are related
    enough that it is ok if they reach each other, then that browsing
    context must be the chosen one. If there are multiple matching
    browsing contexts, the user agent should select one in some
    arbitrary consistent manner, such as the most recently opened,
    most recently focused, or more closely related.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, a new browsing context is being requested, and what
    happens depends on the user agent's configuration and/or
    abilities:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt id="sandboxWindowOpen">If the current browsing context has
     the <span>sandboxed navigation browsing context flag</span>
     set.</dt>

     <dd>The user agent may offer to create a new <span>top-level
     browsing context</span> or reuse an existing <span>top-level
     browsing context</span>. If the user picks one of those options,
     then the designated browsing context must be the chosen one (the
     browsing context's name isn't set to the given browsing context
     name). Otherwise (if the user agent doesn't offer the option to
     the user, or if the user declines to allow a browsing context to
     be used) there must not be a chosen browsing context.</dd>

     <dt id="noopener">If the user agent has been configured such that
     in this instance it will create a new browsing context, and the
     browsing context is being requested as part of <span
     title="following hyperlinks">following a hyperlink</span> whose
     <a href="#linkTypes">link types</a> include the <code
     title="rel-noreferrer">noreferrer</code> keyword</dt>

     <dd>A new <span>top-level browsing context</span> must be
     created. If the given browsing context name is not <code
     title="">_blank</code>, then the new top-level browsing context's
     name must be the given browsing context name (otherwise, it has
     no name). The chosen browsing context must be this new browsing
     context. If it is immediately <span
     title="navigate">navigated</span>, then the navigation will be
     done with <span>replacement enabled</span>.</dd>

     <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this
     instance it will create a new browsing context, and the <code
     title="rel-noreferrer">noreferrer</code> keyword doesn't
     apply</dt>

     <dd>A new <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> must be
     created, with the <span>opener browsing context</span> being the
     current one. If the given browsing context name is not <code
     title="">_blank</code>, then the new auxiliary browsing context's
     name must be the given browsing context name (otherwise, it has
     no name). The chosen browsing context must be this new browsing
     context. If it is immediately <span
     title="navigate">navigated</span>, then the navigation will be

     <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this
     instance it will reuse the current browsing context</dt>

     <dd>The chosen browsing context is the current browsing
     context.</dd>

     <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this
     instance it will not find a browsing context</dt>

     <dd>There must not be a chosen browsing context.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>User agent implementors are encouraged to provide a way for
    users to configure the user agent to always reuse the current
    browsing context.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>



  <h3>The <code>WindowProxy</code> object</h3>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, each <span>browsing context</span> has a
  <dfn>WindowProxy</dfn> object. This object is unusual in that it
  must proxy all operations to the <code>Window</code> object of the
  <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>active document</span>. It is
  thus indistinguishable from that <code>Window</code> object in every
  way, except that it is not equal to it.</p>

  <p>The <code>Window</code> object must also implement the
  <code>EventTarget</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-window"><code>window</code></dfn>, <dfn
  title="dom-frames"><code>frames</code></dfn>, and <dfn
  title="dom-self"><code>self</code></dfn> DOM attributes must all
  return the <code>Window</code> object's <span>browsing
  context</span>'s <code>WindowProxy</code> object.</p>



  <h4>Security</h4>

  <p>User agents must raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception
  whenever any of the members of a <code>Window</code> object are
  accessed by scripts whose <span>effective script origin</span> is
  not the same as the <code>Window</code> object's
  <code>Document</code>'s <span>effective script origin</span>, with
  the following exceptions:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The <code title="dom-location">location</code> object

   <li>The <code title="dom-window-postMessage-2">postMessage()</code>
   method with two arguments

   <li>The <code title="dom-window-postMessage-3">postMessage()</code>
   method with three arguments

   <li>The <code title="dom-frames">frames</code> attribute

   <li>The <span>dynamic nested browsing context properties</span>

  </ul>

  <p>User agents must not allow scripts to override the <code
  title="dom-location">location</code> object's setter.</p>




  <h4>APIs for creating and navigating browsing contexts by name</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-open"><code>open()</code></dfn> method on
  <code>Window</code> objects provides a mechanism for <span
  title="navigate">navigating</span> an existing <span>browsing
  context</span> or opening and navigating an <span>auxiliary browsing
  context</span>.</p>

  <p>The method has four arguments, though they are all optional.</p>

  <p>The first argument, <var title="">url</var>, must be a
  <span>valid URL</span> for a page to load in the browsing
  context. If no arguments are provided, or if the first argument is
  the empty string, then the <var title="">url</var> argument defaults
  to "<code>about:blank</code>". The argument must be <span
  title="resolve a url">resolved</span> to an <span>absolute
  URL</span> (or an error), relative to the <span>first
  script</span>'s <span title="script's base URL">base URL</span>,
  when the method is invoked.</p>

  <p>The second argument, <var title="">target</var>, specifies the
  <span title="browsing context name">name</span> of the browsing
  context that is to be navigated. It must be a <span>valid browsing
  context name or keyword</span>. If fewer than two arguments are
  provided, then the <var title="">name</var> argument defaults to the
  value "<code>_blank</code>".</p>

  <p>The third argument, <var title="">features</var>, has no effect
  and is supported for historical reasons only.</p>

  <p>The fourth argument, <var title="">replace</var>, specifies
  whether or not the new page will <span title="replacement
  enabled">replace</span> the page currently loaded in the browsing
  context, when <var title="">target</var> identifies an existing
  browsing context (as opposed to leaving the current page in the
  browsing context's <span>session history</span>). When three or
  fewer arguments are provided, <var title="">replace</var> defaults
  to false.</p>

  <p>When the method is invoked, the user agent must first select a
  <span>browsing context</span> to navigate by applying <span>the
  rules for choosing a browsing context given a browsing context
  name</span> using the <var title="">target</var> argument as the
  name and the <span>browsing context</span> of the script as the
  context in which the algorithm is executed, unless the user has
  indicated a preference, in which case the browsing context to
  navigate may instead be the one indicated by the user.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, suppose there is a user agent that
  supports control-clicking a link to open it in a new tab. If a user
  clicks in that user agent on an element whose <code
  title="handler-onclick">onclick</code> handler uses the <code
  title="dom-open">window.open()</code> API to open a page in an
  iframe, but, while doing so, holds the control key down, the user
  agent could override the selection of the target browsing context to
  instead target a new tab.</p>

  <p>Then, the user agent must <span>navigate</span> the selected
  <span>browsing context</span> to the <span>absolute URL</span> (or
  error) obtained from <span title="resolve a url">resolving</span>
  <var title="">url</var> earlier. If the <var title="">replace</var>
  is true, then <span title="replacement enabled">replacement must be
  enabled</span>; otherwise, it must not be enabled unless the
  <span>browsing context</span> was just created as part of the
  <span>the rules for choosing a browsing context given a browsing
  context name</span>. The navigation must be done with the <span
  title="script's browsing context">browsing context</span> of the
  <span title="concept-script">script</span> that invoked the method
  as the <span>source browsing context</span>.</p>

  <p>The method must return the <code>WindowProxy</code> object of the
  <span>browsing context</span> that was navigated, or null if no
  browsing context was navigated.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-name"><code>name</code></dfn> attribute of
  the <code>Window</code> object must, on getting, return the current
  name of the <span>browsing context</span>, and, on setting, set the
  name of the <span>browsing context</span> to the new value.</p>

  <p class="note">The name <a href="#resetBCName">gets reset</a> when
  the browsing context is navigated to another domain.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-window-close"><code>close()</code></dfn>
  method on <code>Window</code> objects should, if the corresponding
  <span>browsing context</span> <var title="">A</var> is an
  <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> that was created by a script
  (as opposed to by an action of the user), and if the <span
  title="script's browsing context">browsing context</span> of the
  <span title="concept-script">script</span> that invokes the method
  is <span>allowed to navigate</span> the <span>browsing
  context</span> <var title="">A</var>, close the <span>browsing
  context</span> <var title="">A</var> (and may <span title="a
  browsing context is discarded">discard</span> it too).</p>



  <h4>Accessing other browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-length"><code>length</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute on the <code>Window</code> interface must return the
  number of <span title="child browsing context">child browsing
  contexts</span> of the <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>The <span>indices of the supported indexed properties</span> on
  the <code>Window</code> object at any instant are the numbers in the
  range 0 .. <span><var title="">n</var>-1</span>, where <var
  title="">n</var> is the number of <span title="child browsing
  context">child browsing contexts</span> of the
  <code>Document</code>. If <var title="">n</var> is zero then there
  are no <span>supported indexed properties</span>.</p>

  <p>When a <code>Window</code> object is <dfn
  title="dom-window-item">indexed to retrieve an indexed
  property</dfn> <var title="">index</var>, the value returned must be
  the <var title="">index</var>th <span>child browsing context</span>
  of the <code>Document</code>, sorted in the <span>tree order</span>
  of the elements nesting those <span title="browsing
  context">browsing contexts</span>.</p>

  <p>These properties are the <dfn>dynamic nested browsing context
  properties</dfn>.</p>


  <h4>Garbage collection and browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> has a strong reference to each of
  its <code>Document</code>s and its <code>WindowProxt</code> object,
  and the user agent itself has a strong reference to its <span
  title="top-level browsing context">top-level browsing
  contexts</span>.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> has a strong reference to each of its
  <span title="view">views</span> and their <code>AbstractView</code>
  objects.</p>

  <p>When a <span>browsing context</span> is to <dfn>discard a
  <code>Document</code></dfn>, that means that it is to lose the
  strong reference from the <code>Document</code>'s <span>browsing
  context</span> to the <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>default
  view</span>'s <code>Window</code> object <span title="implied strong
  reference">has a strong reference of its own</span> to its
  <code>Document</code> object.</p>

  <p>When <dfn>a <em><span>browsing context</span></em> is
  discarded</dfn>, the strong reference from the user agent itself to
  the <span>browsing context</span> must be severed, and all the
  <code>Document</code> objects for all the entries in the
  <span>browsing context</span>'s session history must be <span
  title="discard a document">discarded</span> as well.</p>

  <p>User agents may <span title="a browsing context is
  discarded">discard</span> <span title="top-level browsing
  context">top-level browsing contexts</span> at any time (typically,
  in response to user requests, e.g. when a user closes a window
  containing one or more <span title="top-level browsing
  context">top-level browsing contexts</span>). Other <span
  title="browsing context">browsing contexts</span> must be discarded
  once their <code>WindowProxy</code> object is eligible for garbage
  collection.</p>



  <h4>Named access on the <code>Window</code> object</h4>

  <p>The <code>Window</code> interface <span title="support named
  properties">supports named properties</span>. The <span>names of the
  supported named properties</span> at any moment consist of:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The value of the <code title="">name</code> content attribute
   for all <code>a</code>, <code>applet</code>, <code>area</code>,
   <code>embed</code>, <code>frame</code>, <code>frameset</code>,
   <code>form</code>, <code>iframe</code>, <code>img</code>, and
   <code>object</code> elements in the <span>active document</span>
   that have a <code title="">name</code> content attribute, and,</li>

   <li>The value of the <code title="attr-id">id</code> content
   attribute of any <span title="HTML elements">HTML element</span> in
   the <span>active document</span> with an <code
   title="attr-id">id</code> content attribute.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>When <dfn title="dom-window-namedItem">the <code>Window</code>
  object is indexed for property retrieval</dfn> using a name <var
  title="">name</var>, then the user agent must return the value
  obtained using the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">elements</var> be the list of <span
    title="dom-window-namedItem-filter">named elements</span> with the
    name <var title="">name</var> in the <span>active document</span>.

    <p class="note">There will be at least one such element, by
    definition.<!-- (If there wasn't, then this algorithm wouldn't
    have been invoked by WebIDL.) --></p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">elements</var> contains an <code>iframe</code>
    element, then return the <code>WindowProxy</code> object of the
    <span>nested browsing context</span> represented by the first such
    <code>iframe</code> element in <span>tree order</span>, and abort
    these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, if <var title="">elements</var> has only one
    element, return that element and abort these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise return an <code>HTMLCollection</code> rooted at the
    <code>Document</code> node, whose filter matches only <span
    title="dom-window-namedItem-filter">named elements</span> with
    the name <var title="">name</var>.</p> <!-- the same one each time
    is returned, because of the rule under collections -->

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p><dfn title="dom-window-nameditem-filter">Named elements</dfn>
  with the name <var title="">name</var>, for the purposes of the
  above algorithm, are those that are either:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><code>a</code>, <code>applet</code>, <code>area</code>,
   <code>embed</code>, <code>form</code>, <code>frame</code>,
   <code>frameset</code>, <code>iframe</code>, <code>img</code>, or
   <code>object</code> elements that have a <code
   title="attr-name">name</code> content attribute whose value is <var
   title="">name</var>, or</li>

   <li><span>HTML elements</span> elements that have an <code
   title="attr-id">id</code> content attribute whose value is <var
   title="">name</var>.</li>

  </ul>



  <h4>Browser interface elements</h4>

  <p>To allow Web pages to integrate with Web browsers, certain Web
  browser interface elements are exposed in a limited way to scripts
  in Web pages.</p>

  <p>Each interface element is represented by a <code>BarProp</code>
  object:</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>BarProp</dfn> {
           attribute boolean <span title="dom-BarProp-visible">visible</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-BarProp-visible">visible</dfn> attribute, on
  getting, must return either true or a value determined by the user
  agent to most accurately represent the visibility state of the user
  interface element that the object represents, as described below. On
  setting, the new value must be discarded.</p>

  <p>The following <code>BarProp</code> objects exist for each
  <code>Document</code> object in a <span>browsing
  context</span>. Some of the user interface elements represented by
  these objects might have no equivalent in some user agents; for
  those user agents, unless otherwise specified, the object must act
  as if it was present and visible (i.e. its <code
  title="dom-BarProp-visible">visible</code> attribute must return
  true).</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn>The location bar <code>BarProp</code> object</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Represents the user interface element that contains a control
   that displays the <span>URL</span> of the <span>active
   document</span>, or some similar interface concept.</dd>

   <dt><dfn>The menu bar <code>BarProp</code> object</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Represents the user interface element that contains a list of
   commands in menu form, or some similar interface concept.</dd>

   <dt><dfn>The personal bar <code>BarProp</code> object</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Represents the user interface element that contains links to
   the user's favorite pages, or some similar interface concept.</dd>

   <dt><dfn>The scrollbar <code>BarProp</code> object</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Represents the user interface element that contains a scrolling
   mechanism, or some similar interface concept.</dd>

   <dt><dfn>The status bar <code>BarProp</code> object</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Represents a user interface element found immediately below or
   after the document, as appropriate for the <span>default
   view</span>'s media. If the user agent has no such user interface
   element, then the object may act as if the corresponding user
   interface element was absent (i.e. its <code
   title="dom-BarProp-visible">visible</code> attribute may return
   false).</dd>

   <dt><dfn>The tool bar <code>BarProp</code> object</dfn></dt>

   <dd>Represents the user interface element found immediately above
   or before the document, as appropriate for the <span>default

   element, then the object may act as if the corresponding user
   interface element was absent (i.e. its <code
   title="dom-BarProp-visible">visible</code> attribute may return
   false).</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-window-locationbar"><code>locationbar</code></dfn>
  attribute must return <span>the location bar <code>BarProp</code>
  object</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-window-menubar"><code>menubar</code></dfn>
  attribute must return <span>the menu bar <code>BarProp</code>
  object</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn

  <h3>Origin</h3>
  <!-- Hallowed are the Ori -->

  <p>The <dfn>origin</dfn> of a resource and the <dfn>effective script
  origin</dfn> of a resource are both either opaque identifiers or
  tuples consisting of a scheme component, a host component, a port
  component, and optionally extra data.</p>

  <p class="note">The extra data could include the certificate of the
  site when using encrypted connections, to ensure that if the site's
  secure certificate changes, the origin is considered to change as
  well.</p>

  <p>These characteristics are defined as follows:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>For URLs</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The <span>origin</span> and <span>effective script
    origin</span> of the <span>URL</span> is whatever is returned by

      with both the AllowUnassigned and UseSTD3ASCIIRules flags
      set. Let <var title="">host</var> be the result of the ToASCII
      algorithm.</p>

      <p>If ToASCII fails to convert one of the components of the
      string, e.g. because it is too long or because it contains
      invalid characters, then return a new globally unique
      identifier. <a href="#refsRFC3490">[RFC3490]</a></p>

     <li><p>If there is no <span title="url-port">&lt;port&gt;</span>
     component, then let <var title="">port</var> be the default port
     for the protocol given by <var title="">scheme</var>. Otherwise,
     let <var title="">port</var> be the <span

     <li><p>Return the tuple (<var title="">scheme</var>, <var

    <p>In addition, if the <span>URL</span> is in fact associated with
    a <code>Document</code> object that was created by parsing the
    resource obtained from fetching <span>URL</span>, and this was

  <h4>Relaxing the same-origin restriction</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-domain"><code>domain</code></dfn>
  attribute on <code>Document</code> objects must be initialized to
  <span>the document's domain</span>, if it has one, and the empty
  string otherwise. On getting, the attribute must return its current
  value, unless the document was created by
  <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, in which case it must throw an
  <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception. On setting, the user
  agent must run the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the document was created by <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>,
    throw an <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception and abort these
    steps.</p>

   </li>

    algorithm.</p>

    <p>If ToASCII fails to convert one of the components of the
    string, e.g. because it is too long or because it contains invalid
    characters, then throw a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception and abort
    these steps. <a href="#refsRFC3490">[RFC3490]</a></p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">new value</var> is not exactly equal to the

    run these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>

      <p>If the current value is an IP address, throw a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code>
      exception and abort these steps.</p>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>If <var title="">new value</var>, prefixed by a U+002E FULL

      throw a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception and abort these
      steps.</p>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>If <var title="">new value</var> matches a suffix in the
      Public Suffix List, or, if <var title="">new value</var>,
      prefixed by a U+002E FULL STOP ("."), matches the end of a

  <h3 id="scripting">Scripting</h3>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>Various mechanisms can cause author-provided executable code to
  run in the context of a document. These mechanisms include, but are
  probably not limited to:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Processing of <code>script</code> elements.</li>

   <li>Processing of inline <code title="javascript
   protocol">javascript:</code> URLs (e.g. the <code
   title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute of <code>img</code>
   elements, or an <code title="">@import</code> rule in a CSS
   <code>style</code> element block).</li>

   <li>Event handlers, whether registered through the DOM using <code
   title="">addEventListener()</code>, by explicit <span>event handler
   content attributes</span>, by <span>event handler DOM
   attributes</span>, or otherwise.</li>

   <li>Processing of technologies like XBL or SVG that have their own
   scripting features.</li>

  </ul>




  <h4>Enabling and disabling scripting</h4>

  <p><dfn title="concept-bc-script">Scripting is enabled</dfn> in a
  <em><span>browsing context</span></em> when all of the
  following conditions are true:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The user agent supports scripting.</li>

   <li>The user has not disabled scripting for this <span>browsing
   context</span> at this time. (User agents may provide users with
   the option to disable scripting globally, or in a finer-grained
   manner, e.g. on a per-origin basis.)</li>

   <li id="sandboxScriptBlocked">The <span>browsing context</span>

  </ul>

  <p><dfn title="concept-bc-noscript">Scripting is disabled</dfn> in a

  <!-- SCRIPT EXEC (marks areas related to creation of scripts) -->
  <h4>Processing model</h4>

  <h5>Definitions</h5>

  <p>A <dfn title="concept-script">script</dfn> has:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>A <dfn>script execution environment</dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The characteristics of the script execution environment depend
    on the language, and are not defined by this specification.</p>

    <p class="example">In JavaScript, the script execution environment
    consists of the interpreter, the stack of <i>execution
    contexts</i>, the <i>global code</i> and <i>function code</i> and
    the Function objects resulting, and so forth.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>A <dfn>list of code entry-points</dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Each code entry-point represents a block of executable code
    that the script exposes to other scripts and to the user
    agent.</p>

    <p class="example">Each Function object in a JavaScript
    <span>script execution environment</span> has a corresponding code
    entry-point, for instance.</p>

    <p>The main program code of the script, if any, is the
    <dfn><i>initial code entry-point</i></dfn>. Typically, the code
    corresponding to this entry-point is executed immediately after
    the script is parsed.</p>

    <p class="example">In JavaScript, this corresponds to the
    execution context of the global code.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>A relationship with the <dfn>script's global object</dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>An object that provides the APIs that the code can use.</p>

    <p class="example">This is typically a <code>Window</code>
    object. In JavaScript, this corresponds to the <i>global
    object</i>.</p>

    <p class="note">When a <span>script's global object</span> is an
    empty object, it can't do anything that interacts with the
    environment.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>A relationship with the <dfn>script's browsing context</dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A <span>browsing context</span> that is assigned responsibility
    for actions taken by the script.</p>

    <p class="example">When a script creates and <span
    title="navigate">navigates</span> a new <span>top-level browsing
    context</span>, the <code title="dom-opener">opener</code>
    attribute of the new <span>browsing context</span>'s
    <code>Window</code> object will be set to the <span>script's
    browsing context</span>'s <code>Window</code> object.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>A <dfn title="script's character encoding">character encoding</dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A character encoding, set when the script is created, used to
    encode URLs.  <span id="sce-not-copy">If the character encoding is
    set from another source, e.g. a <span>document's character
    encoding</span>, then the <span>script's character encoding</span>
    must follow the source, so that if the source's changes, so does
    the script's.</span></p>

   </dd>

   <dt>A <dfn title="script's base URL">base URL</dfn></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A <span>URL</span>, set when the script is created, used to
    resolve relative URLs. <span id="sbu-not-copy">If the base URL is
    set from another source, e.g. a <span>document base URL</span>,
    then the <span>script's base URL</span> must follow the source, so
    that if the source's changes, so does the script's.</span></p>

   </dd>

  </dl>



  <h5>Calling scripts</h5>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>jump to a code entry-point</dfn> for
  a <span title="concept-script">script</span>, for example to invoke
  an event listener defined in that <span
  title="concept-script">script</span>, the user agent must run the
  following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <span>script's global object</span> is a
   <code>Window</code> object whose <code>Document</code> object is
   not <span>fully active</span>, then abort these steps without doing
   anything. The callback is not fired.</p>

   <li><p>Set the <span>first script</span> to be the <span
   title="concept-script">script</span> being invoked.</p></li>

   <li><p>Make the <span title="script execution environment">script
   execution environment</span> for the <span
   title="concept-script">script</span> execute the code for the given
   code entry-point.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>first script</span> back to whatever it was
   when this algorithm started.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>This algorithm is not invoked by one script calling another.</p>


  <h5 id="creating-scripts">Creating scripts</h5>

  <p>When the specification says that a <span
  title="concept-script">script</span> is to be <dfn title="create a
  script">created</dfn>, given some script source, its scripting
  language, a global object, a browsing context, a character encoding,
  and a base URL, the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Set up a <span>script execution environment</span> as
   appropriate for the scripting language.</p></li>

   <li><p>Parse/compile/initialize the source of the script using the
   <span>script execution environment</span>, as appropriate for the
   scripting language, and thus obtain the <span>list of code
   entry-points</span> for the script. If the semantics of the
   scripting language and the given source code are such that there is
   executable code to be immediately run, then the <i>initial code
   entry-point</i> is the entry-point for that code.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set up the <span>script's global object</span>, the
   <span>script's browsing context</span>, the <span>script's
   character encoding</span>, and the <span>script's base URL</span>
   from the settings passed to this algorithm.</p></li>

   <li><p><span title="jump to a code entry-point">Jump</span> to the
   <span title="concept-script">script</span>'s <i>initial code
   entry-point</i>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <hr>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>create an impotent script</dfn>,
  given some script source, its scripting language, and a browsing
  context, the user agent must <span>create a script</span>, using the
  given script source and scripting language, using a new empty object
  as the global object, and using the given browsing context as the
  browsing context. The character encoding and base URL for the
  resulting <span title="concept-script">script</span> are not
  important as no APIs are exposed to the script.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When the specification says that a <span
  title="concept-script">script</span> is to be <dfn title="create a
  script from a node">created from a node</dfn> <var
  title="">node</var>, given some script source and its scripting
  language, the user agent must <span>create a script</span>, using
  the given script source and scripting language, and using <span>the
  script settings determined from the node</span> <var
  title="">node</var>.</p>

  <p><dfn>The script settings determined from the node</dfn> <var
  title="">node</var> are computed as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">document</var> be the
   <code>Document</code> of <var title="">node</var> (or <var
   title="">node</var> itself if it is a
   <code>Document</code>).</p></li>

   <li><p>The browsing context is the <span>browsing context</span> of
   <var title="">document</var>.</p>

   <li><p>The global object is the <code>Window</code> object of
   <var title="">document</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The character encoding is the <span title="document's
   character encoding">character encoding</span> of <var
   title="">document</var>. (<a href="#sce-not-copy">This is a
   reference, not a copy</a>.)</p></li>

   <li><p>The base URL is the <span title="document base URL">base
   URL</span> of <var title="">document</var>. (<a
   href="#sbu-not-copy">This is a reference, not a copy</a>.)</p></li>

  </ol>


  <h5>Killing scripts</h5>

  <p>User agents may impose resource limitations on scripts, for
  example CPU quotas, memory limits, total execution time limits, or
  bandwidth limitations. When a script exceeds a limit, the user agent
  may either throw a <code>QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR</code> exception, abort
  the script without an exception, prompt the user, or throttle script
  execution.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, the following script never terminates. A user agent
   could, after waiting for a few seconds, prompt the user to either
   terminate the script or let it continue.</p>

   <pre>&lt;script>
 while (true) { /* loop */ }
&lt;/script></pre>

  </div>

  <p>User agents are encouraged to allow users to disable scripting
  whenever the user is prompted either by a script (e.g. using the
  <code title="dom-alert">window.alert()</code> API) or because of a
  script's actions (e.g. because it has exceeded a time limit).</p>

  <p>If scripting is disabled while a script is executing, the script
  should be terminated immediately.</p>


  <h4>Event loops</h4>

  <p>To coordinate events, user interaction, scripts, rendering,
  networking, and so forth, user agents must use <dfn title="event
  loop">event loops</dfn> as described in this section.</p>

  <p>There must be at least one <span>event loop</span> per user
  agent, and at most one <span>event loop</span> per <span>unit of
  related similar-origin browsing contexts</span>.</p>

  <p>An <span>event loop</span> always has at least one <span>browsing
  context</span>. If an <span>event loop</span>'s <span
  title="browsing context">browsing contexts</span> all go away, then
  the <span>event loop</span> goes away as well. A <span>browsing
  context</span> always has an <span>event loop</span> coordinating
  its activities.</p>

  <p class="note">Other specifications can define new kinds of event
  loops that aren't associated with browsing contexts.</p>

  <p>An <span>event loop</span> has one or more <dfn title="task
  queue">task queues</dfn>. A <span>task queue</span> is an ordered
  list of <dfn title="concept-task">tasks</dfn>, which can be:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Events</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Asynchronously dispatching an <code>Event</code> object at a
    particular <code>EventTarget</code> object is a task.</p>

    <p class="note">Not all events are dispatched using the <span>task
    queue</span>, many are dispatched synchronously during other
    tasks.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Parsing</dt>

   <dd><p>The <span>HTML parser</span> tokenising a single byte, and
   then processing any resulting tokens, is a task.</p></dd>


   <dt>Callbacks</dt>

   <dd><p>Calling a callback asynchronously is a task.</p></dd>


   <dt>Using a resource</dt>

   <dd><p>When an algorithm <span title="fetch">fetches</span> a
   resource, if the fetching occurs asynchronously then the processing
   of the resource once some or all of the resource is available is a
   task.</p></dd>


   <dt>Reacting to DOM manipulation</dt>

   <dd><p>Some elements have tasks that trigger in response to DOM
   manipulation, e.g. when that element is <span title="insert an
   element into a document">inserted into the document</span>.</p>

  </dl>

  <p>Each <span title="concept-task">task</span> is associated with a
  <code>Document</code>; if the task was queued in the context of an
  element, then it is the element's <code>Document</code>; if the task
  was queued in the context of a <span>browsing context</span>, then
  it is the <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>active
  document</span> at the time the task was queued; if the task was
  queued by or for a <span title="concept-script">script</span> then
  the document is the script's <span>script's browsing
  context</span>'s <span>active document</span> at the time the task
  was queued.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>queue a task</dfn>, it must add the
  given task to one of the <span title="task queue">task queues</span>
  of the relevant <span>event loop</span>. All the tasks from one
  particular <dfn>task source</dfn> (e.g. the callbacks generated by
  timers, the events dispatched for mouse movements, the tasks queued
  for the parser) must always be added to the same <span>task
  queue</span>, but tasks from different <span title="task
  source">task sources</span> may be placed in different <span
  title="task queue">task queues</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, a user agent could have one
  <span>task queue</span> for mouse and key events (the <span>user
  interaction task source</span>), and another for everything
  else. The user agent could then give keyboard and mouse events
  preference over other tasks three quarters of the time, keeping the
  interface responsive but not starving other task queues, and never
  processing events from any one <span>task source</span> out of
  order.</p>

  <p>An <span>event loop</span> must continually run through the
  following steps for as long as it exists:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Run the oldest task on one of the <span>event loop</span>'s
   <span title="task queue">task queues</span>, ignoring tasks whose
   associated <code>Document</code>s are not <span>fully
   active</span>. The user agent may pick any <span>task
   queue</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Remove that task from its <span>task queue</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If necessary, update the rendering or user interface of any
   <code>Document</code> or <span>browsing context</span> to reflect
   the current state.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return to the first step of the <span>event
   loop</span>.</p></li>

  </ol>



  <h5>Generic task sources</h5>

  <p>The following <span title="task source">task sources</span> are
  used by a number of mostly unrelated features in this and other
  specifications.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>The <dfn>DOM manipulation task source</dfn></dt>

  <p>Many objects can have <dfn>event handler attributes</dfn>
  specified. These act as bubbling event listeners for the element on
  which they are specified.</p>

  <p>An <span title="event handler attributes">event handler
  attribute</span>, unless otherwise specified, can either have the
  value null or be set to a <code>Function</code> object. Initially,
  unless otherwise specified, an event handler attribute must be set
  to null.</p>

  <p class="note">Some event handler attributes allow other values and
  have other initial values, in particular the <code
  title="handler-window-onerror">onerror</code> event handler
  attribute on the <code>Window</code> object.</p>

  <p>Event handler attributes are exposed in one or two ways.</p>

  <p>The first way, common to all event handler attributes, is as an
  <span title="event handler DOM attributes">event handler DOM
  attribute</span>.</p>

  <p>The second way is as an <span title="event handler content
  attributes">event handler content attribute</span>. Event handlers on
  <span>HTML elements</span> and some of the event handlers on
  <code>Window</code> objects are exposed in this way.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><dfn>Event handler DOM attributes</dfn>, on setting, must set the
  corresponding event handler attribute to their new value, and on
  getting, must return whatever the current value of the corresponding
  event handler attribute is (possibly null).</p>

  <p class="note">Certain event handler DOM attributes have additional
  requirements, in particular the <code
  title="handler-MessagePort-onmessage">onmessage</code> attribute of
  <code>MessagePort</code> objects.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><dfn>Event handler content attributes</dfn>, when specified, must
  contain valid ECMAScript code matching the ECMAScript <code
  title="">FunctionBody</code> production. <a
  href="#refsECMA262">[ECMA262]</a></p>

  <!-- SCRIPT EXEC -->
  <p>When an event handler content attribute is set, if the element is
  owned by a <code>Document</code> that is in a <span>browsing
  context</span>, the user agent must run the following steps to
  create a <span title="concept-script">script</span> after setting
  the content attribute to its new value:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Set up a <span>script execution environment</span> for
   JavaScript.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Using this script execution environment, interpret the
    attribute's new value as the body of an anonymous function, with
    the function's arguments set as follows:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

     <dt>If the attribute is the <code
     title="handler-window-onerror">onerror</code> attribute of the
     <code>Window</code> object</dt>

     <dd>Let the function have three arguments, named <code
     title="">event</code>, <code title="">source</code>, and <code
     title="">fileno</code>.</dd>

     <dt>Otherwise</dt>

     <dd>Let the function have a single argument called <code
     title="">event</code>.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>Link the new function's scope chain from the activation object
    of the handler, to the element's object, to the element's
    <span>form owner</span>, if it has one, to the element's
    <code>Document</code> object, to the <code>Window</code> object of
    that <code>Document</code>. Set the function's <code>this</code>
    parameter to the <code>Element</code> object representing the
    element. Let this function be the only entry in the script's
    <span>list of code entry-points</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">See ECMA262 Edition 3, sections 10.1.6 and 10.2.3,
    for more details on activation objects. <a
    href="#refsECMA262">[ECMA262]</a></p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the previous steps failed to compile the script, then set
   the corresponding event handler attribute to null and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set up the <span>script's global object</span>, the
   <span>script's browsing context</span>, the <span>script's
   character encoding</span>, and the <span>script's base URL</span>
   from <span>the script settings determined from the node</span> on
   which the attribute is being set.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the corresponding event handler attribute to the
   aforementioned function.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">When an event handler content attribute is set on an
  element owned by a <code>Document</code> that is not in a
  <span>browsing context</span>, the corresponding event handler
  attribute is not changed.</p>

  <p class="note">Removing an event handler content attribute does not

  <hr>

  <p>All event handler attributes on an element, whether set to null
  or to a <code>Function</code> object<!-- or to anything else, in the
  case of 'onerror' -->, must be registered as event listeners on the
  element, as if the <code
  title="dom-EventTarget-addEventListenerNS">addEventListenerNS()</code>
  method on the <code>Element</code> object's <code>EventTarget</code>
  interface had been invoked when the event handler attribute's
  element or object was created, with the event type (<var
  title="dom-event-type">type</var> argument) equal to the type
  described for the event handler attribute in the list above, the
  namespace (<var title="dom-event-namespaceURI">namespaceURI</var>
  argument) set to null, the listener set to be a target and bubbling
  phase listener (<var title="dom-event-useCapture">useCapture</var>
  argument set to false), the event group set to the default group
  (<var title="dom-event-evtGroup">evtGroup</var> argument set to
  null), and the event listener itself (<var
  title="dom-event-listener">listener</var> argument) set to do
  nothing while the event handler attribute's value is not a
  <code>Function</code> object, and set to invoke the <code
  title="dom-function-call">call()</code> callback of the
  <code>Function</code> object associated with the event handler
  attribute otherwise.</p>

  <p class="note">The <var title="dom-event-listener">listener</var>
  argument is emphatically <em>not</em> the event handler attribute
  itself.</p>

  <p>When an event handler attribute's <code>Function</code> objectw
  is invoked, its <code title="dom-function-call">call()</code>
  callback must be invoked with one argument, set to the
  <code>Event</code> object of the event in question.</p>

  <p>The handler's return value must then be processed as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the event type is <code class="event-mouseover">mouseover</code></dt>

   <dd><p>If the return value is a boolean with the value true, then
   the event must be canceled.</p></dd>

   <dt>If the event object is a <code>BeforeUnloadEvent</code> object</dt>

   <dd><p>If the return value is a string, and the event object's
   <code title="dom-BeforeUnloadEvent-returnValue">returnValue</code>
   attribute's value is the empty string, then set the <code
   title="dom-BeforeUnloadEvent-returnValue">returnValue</code>
   attribute's value to the return value.</p></dd>

   <dt>Otherwise</dt>

   <dd><p>If the return value is a boolean with the value false, then
   the event must be canceled.</p></dd>

  </dl>

  <!-- IE actually uncancels the event if the function returns true -->

  follows:</p>

  <pre class="idl">[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject]
interface <dfn>Function</dfn> {
  any <span title="dom-function-call">call</span>([Variadic] in any arguments);

  <h5>Event firing</h5>

  <p class="XXX">maybe this should be moved higher up
  (terminology? conformance? DOM?) Also, the whole terminology thing
  should be changed so that we don't define any specific events here,
  we only define 'simple event', 'progress event', 'mouse event', 'key
  event', and the like, and have the actual dispatch use those generic
  terms when firing events.</p>

  <p>Certain operations and methods are defined as firing events on
  elements. For example, the <code title="dom-click">click()</code>

  <h5>Events and the <code>Window</code> object</h5>

  <p>When an event is dispatched at a DOM node in a
  <code>Document</code> in a <span>browsing context</span>, if the
  event is not a <code title="event-load">load</code> event, the user
  agent must also dispatch the event to the <code>Window</code>, as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>In the capture phase, the event must be dispatched to the
   <code>Window</code> object before being dispatched to any of the
   nodes.</li>

   <li>In the bubble phase, the event must be dispatched to the
   <code>Window</code> object at the end of the phase, unless bubbling
   has been prevented.</li>

  </ol>



  <h5 id="runtime-script-errors">Runtime script errors</h5>

  <p><em>This section only applies to user agents that support
  scripting in general and ECMAScript in particular.</em></p>

  <p>Whenever a runtime script error occurs in one of the scripts
  associated with a <code>Document</code>, the user agent must
  <span>report the error</span> using the <code
  title="handler-window-onerror">onerror</code> <span title="event
  handler attributes">event handler attribute</span> of the
  <span>script's global object</span>. If the error is still <i
  title="">not handled</i> after this, then the error should be
  reported to the user.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When the user agent is required to <dfn title="report the
  error">report an error</dfn> <var title="">error</var> using the
  event handler attribute <var title="">onerror</var>, it must run
  these steps, after which the error is either <i title="">handled</i>
  or <i title="">not handled</i>:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the value of <var title="">onerror</var> is a
   <code>Function</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The function must be invoked with three arguments. The three
    arguments passed to the function are all <code>DOMString</code>s;
    the first must give the message that the UA is considering
    reporting, the second must give the <span>absolute URL</span> of
    the resource in which the error occurred, and the third must give
    the line number in that resource on which the error occurred.</p>

    <p>If the function returns false, then the error is <i
    title="">handled</i>. Otherwise, the error is <i title="">not
    handled</i>.</p>

    <p>Any exceptions thrown or errors caused by this function must be
    reported to the user immediately after the error that the function
    was called for, without using the <span title="report the
    error">report an error</span> algorithm again.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>If the value is <code>null</code></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The error is <i title="">handled</i>.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>If the value is anything else</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The error is <i title="">not handled</i>.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>





  <h3>User prompts</h3>

  <h4>Simple dialogs</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-alert"><code>alert(<var
  title="">message</var>)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must show
  the given <var title="">message</var> to the user. The user agent
  may make the method wait for the user to acknowledge the message
  before returning; if so, the user agent must <span>pause</span>
  while the method is waiting.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-confirm"><code>confirm(<var
  title="">message</var>)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must show
  the given <var title="">message</var> to the user, and ask the user
  to respond with a positive or negative response. The user agent must
  then <span>pause</span> as the method waits for the user's
  response. If the user responds positively, the method must return
  true, and if the user responds negatively, the method must return
  false.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-prompt"><code>prompt(<var
  title="">message</var>, <var title="">default</var>)</code></dfn>
  method, when invoked, must show the given <var
  title="">message</var> to the user, and ask the user to either
  respond with a string value or abort. The user agent must then
  <span>pause</span> as the method waits for the user's
  response. The second argument is optional. If the second argument
  (<var title="">default</var>) is present, then the response must be
  defaulted to the value given by <var title="">default</var>. If the
  user aborts, then the method must return null; otherwise, the method
  must return the string that the user responded with.</p>


  <h4>Printing</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-print"><code>print()</code></dfn> method,
  when invoked, must run the <span>printing steps</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents should also run the <span>printing steps</span>
  whenever the user asks for the opportunity to <span>obtain a
  physical form</span> (e.g. printed copy), or the representation of a
  physical form (e.g. PDF copy), of a document.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>printing steps</dfn> are as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent may display a message to the user and/or may
    abort these steps.</p>

    <p class="example">For instance, a kiosk browser could silently
    ignore any invocations of the <code
    title="dom-print">print()</code> method.</p>

    <p class="example">For instance, a browser on a mobile device
    could detect that there are no printers in the vicinity and
    display a message saying so before continuing to offer a "save to
    PDF" option.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must <span>fire a simple event</span> called
    <code title="event-beforeprint">beforeprint</code> at the
    <code>Window</code> object of the <code>Document</code> that is
    being printed, as well as any <span title="nested browsing
    context">nested browsing contexts</span> in it.</p>

    <p class="example">The <code
    title="event-beforeprint">beforeprint</code> event can be used
    to annotate the printed copy, for instance adding the time at
    which the document was printed.</p>
   
   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent should offer the user the opportunity to
    <span>obtain a physical form</span> (or the representation of a
    physical form) of the document. The user agent may wait for the
    user to either accept or decline before returning; if so, the user
    agent must <span>pause</span> while the method is waiting. Even if
    the user agent doesn't wait at this point, the user agent must use
    the state of the relevant documents as they are at this point in
    the algorithm if and when it eventually creates the alternate
    form.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>The user agent must <span>fire a simple event</span> called
    <code title="event-afterprint">afterprint</code> at the
    <code>Window</code> object of the <code>Document</code> that is
    being printed, as well as any <span title="nested browsing
    context">nested browsing contexts</span> in it.</p>

    <p class="example">The <code
    title="event-afterprint">afterprint</code> event can be used
    to revert annotations added in the earlier event, as well as
    showing post-printing UI. For instance, if a page is walking the
    user through the steps of applying for a home loan, the script
    could automatically advance to the next step after having printed
    a form or other.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>


  <h4>Dialogs implemented using separate documents</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-showModalDialog"><code>showModalDialog(<var
  title="">url</var>, <var title="">argument</var><!--, <var
  title="">features</var>-->)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must
  cause the user agent to run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p><span title="resolve a url">Resolve</span> <var
    title="">url</var> relative to the <span>first script</span>'s
    <span title="script's base URL">base URL</span>.</p>

    <p>If this fails, then throw a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception
    and abort these steps.</p>

   <li>

    <p>If the user agent is configured such that this invocation of
    <code title="dom-showModalDialog">showModalDialog()</code> is
    somehow disabled, then the method returns the empty string; abort
    these steps.</p>

    <p class="note">User agents are expected to disable this method in
    certain cases to avoid user annoyance (e.g. as part of their popup
    blocker feature). For instance, a user agent could require that a
    site be white-listed before enabling this method, or the user
    agent could be configured to only allow one modal dialog at a
    time.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">the list of background browsing
    contexts</var> be a list of all the browsing contexts that:</p>

    <ul>

     <li>are part of the same <span>unit of related browsing
     contexts</span> as the browsing context of the
     <code>Window</code> object on which the <code
     title="dom-showModalDialog">showModalDialog()</code> method was
     called, and that</li>

     <li>have an <span>active document</span> whose
     <span>origin</span> is the <span title="same origin">same</span>
     as the <span>origin</span> of the <span
     title="concept-script">script</span> that called the <code
     title="dom-showModalDialog">showModalDialog()</code> method at
     the time the method was called,</li> <!-- Note that changing
     document.domain to talk to another domain doesn't make you able
     to block that domain -->

    </ul>

    <p>...as well as any browsing contexts that are nested inside any
    of the browsing contexts matching those conditions.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Disable the user interface for all the browsing contexts in
    <var title="">the list of background browsing contexts</var>. This
    should prevent the user from navigating those browsing contexts,
    causing events to to be sent to those browsing context, or editing
    any content in those browsing contexts. However, it does not
    prevent those browsing contexts from receiving events from sources
    other than the user, from running scripts, from running
    animations, and so forth.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Create a new <span>auxiliary browsing context</span>, with the
    <span>opener browsing context</span> being the browsing context of
    the <code>Window</code> object on which the <code
    title="dom-showModalDialog">showModalDialog()</code> method was
    called. The new auxiliary browsing context has no name.</p>

    <p class="note">This <span>browsing context</span>'s
    <code>Document</code>s' <code>Window</code> objects all implement
    the <code>WindowModal</code> interface.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let the <span>dialog arguments</span> of the new browsing
    context be set to the value of <var title="">argument</var>, or
    the 'undefined' value if the argument was omitted.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let the <span>dialog arguments' origin</span> be the
    <span>origin</span> of the <span
    title="concept-script">script</span> that called the <code
    title="dom-showModalDialog">showModalDialog()</code> method.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Navigate</span> the new <span>browsing context</span> to
    the <span>absolute URL</span> that resulted from <span
    title="resolve a url">resolving</span> <var title="">url</var>

    title="script's browsing context">browsing context</span> of the
    <span title="concept-script">script</span> that invoked the method
    as the <span>source browsing context</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Wait for the browsing context to be closed. (The user agent
    must allow the user to indicate that the browsing context is to be
    closed.)</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Reenable the user interface for all the browsing contexts in
    <var title="">the list of background browsing contexts</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Return the <span>auxiliary browsing context</span>'s
    <span>return value</span>.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <code>Window</code> objects of <code>Document</code>s hosted
  by <span title="browsing context">browsing contexts</span> created
  by the above algorithm must all implement the
  <code>WindowModal</code> interface:</p>

  <p class="XXX">Really I want the Window object to just gain these
  attributes, as if they were on the Window prototype. That's the XXX
  below.</p>

  <pre class="idl">[NoInterfaceObject, ImplementedOn=<span>Window</span>, XXX] interface <dfn>WindowModal</dfn> {
  readonly attribute any <span title="dom-WindowModal-dialogArguments">dialogArguments</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-WindowModal-returnValue">returnValue</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>Such browsing contexts have associated <dfn>dialog
  arguments</dfn>, which are stored along with the <dfn>dialog
  arguments' origin</dfn>. These values are set by the <code
  title="dom-showModalDialog">showModalDialog()</code> method in the
  algorithm above, when the browsing context is created, based on the
  arguments provided to the method.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-WindowModal-dialogArguments"><code>dialogArguments</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute, on getting, must check whether its browsing context's
  <span>active document</span>'s <span>origin</span> is the <span
  title="same origin">same</span> as the <span>dialog arguments'
  origin</span>. If it is, then the browsing context's <span>dialog
  arguments</span> must be returned unchanged. Otherwise, if the
  <span>dialog arguments</span> are an object, then the empty string
  must be returned, and if the <span>dialog arguments</span> are not
  an object, then the stringification of the <span>dialog
  arguments</span> must be returned.

  <p>These browsing contexts also have an associated <dfn>return
  value</dfn>. The <span>return value</span> of a browsing context
  must be initialized to the empty string when the browsing context is
  created.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-WindowModal-returnValue"><code>returnValue</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute, on getting, must return the <span>return value</span>
  of its browsing context, and on setting, must set the <span>return
  value</span> to the given new value.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code
  title="dom-window-close">window.close()</code> method can be used to
  close the browsing context.</p>


<!-- XXX-NOTIFY
  <h4>Notifications</h4>

<!- - v2 feature requests:

   - ability to snooze a notification so it comes again later
      - shouldn't be on all messages, only those for which it makes
        sense
      - possibly just provide a new argument that takes an array of
        (label, callback) tuples so that sites can implement this
        themselves
      - full HTML notifications

  - ->

  <p>Notifications are short, transient messages that bring the user's
  attention to new information, or remind the user of scheduled
  events.</p>

  <p>Since notifications can be annoying if abused, this specification
  defines a mechanism that scopes notifications to a site's existing
  rendering area unless the user explicitly indicates that the site
  can be trusted.</p>

  <p>To this end, each <span>origin</span> can be flagged as being a
  <dfn>trusted notification source</dfn>. By default origins should
  not be flagged as such, but user agents may allow users to whitelist
  origins or groups of origins as being <span title="trusted
  notification source">trusted notification sources</span>. Only
  origins flagged as trusted in this way are allowed to show
  notification UI outside of their tab.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, a user agent could allow a user to
  mark all subdomains and ports of example.org as trusted
  notification sources. Then, mail.example.org and
  calendar.example.org would both be able to show notifications,
  without the user having to flag them individually.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-showNotification"><code>showNotification(<var
  title="">title</var>, <var title="">subtitle</var>, <var
  title="">description</var>, <var
  title="">onclick</var>)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must
  cause the user agent to show a notification.</p>

  <p id="sandboxNotifications">If the method was invoked from a <span
  title="concept-script">script</span> whose <span title="script's
  browsing context">browsing context</span> has the <span>sandboxed
  annoyances browsing context flag</span> set, then the notification
  must be shown within that <span>browsing context</span>. The
  notification is said to be a <dfn>sandboxed notification</dfn>.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the <span>origin</span> of the <span
  title="script's browsing context">browsing context</span> of the
  <span title="concept-script">script</span> that invoked the method
  is <em>not</em> flagged as being a <span>trusted notification
  source</span>, then the notification should be rendered within the
  <span>top-level browsing context</span> of the <span>script's
  browsing context</span>. The notification is said to be a
  <dfn>normal notification</dfn>. User agents should provide a way to
  set the origin's <span>trusted notification source</span> flag from
  the notification, so that the user can benefit from notifications
  even when the user agent is not the active application.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the <span>origin</span> is flagged as a <span>trusted
  notification source</span>, and the notification should be shown
  using the platform conventions for system-wide notifications. The
  notification is said to be a <dfn>trusted notification</dfn>. User
  agents may provide a way to unset the origin's <span>trusted
  notification source</span> flag from within the notification, so as
  to allow users to easily disable notifications from sites that abuse
  the privilege.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, if a site contains a gadget of a mail application
   in a sandboxed <code>iframe</code> and that frame triggers a
   notification upon the receipt of a new e-mail message, that
   notification would be displayed on top of the gadget only.</p>

   <p>However, if the user then goes to the main site of that mail
   application, the notification would be displayed over the entire
   rendering area of the tab for the site.</p>

   <p>The notification, in this case, would have a button on it to let
   the user indicate that he trusts the site. If the user clicked this
   button, the next notification would use the system-wide
   notification system, appearing even if the tab for the mail
   application was buried deep inside a minimised window.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The style of notifications varies from platform to platform. On
   some, it is typically displayed as a "toast" window that slides in
   from the bottom right corner. In others, notifications are shown as
   semi-transparent white-on-grey overlays centered over the
   screen. Other schemes could include simulated ticker tapes, and
   speech-synthesis playback.</p>

  </div>

  <p>When a <span>normal notification</span> (but not a
  <span>sandboxed notification</span>) is shown, the user agent may
  bring the user's attention to the <span>top-level browsing
  context</span> of the <span title="script's browsing
  context">browsing context</span> of the <span
  title="concept-script">script</span> that invoked the method, if
  that would be useful; but user agents should not use system-wide
  notification mechanisms to do so.</p>

  <p>When a <span>trusted notification</span> is shown, the user agent
  should bring the user's attention to the notification and the <span
  title="script's browsing context">browsing context</span> of the
  <span title="concept-script">script</span> that invoked the method,
  as per the platform conventions for attracting the user's attention
  to applications.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the case of <span title="normal notification">normal
   notifications</span>, typically the only attention-grabbing device
   that would be employed would be something like flashing the tab's
   caption, or making it bold, or some such.</p>

   <p>In addition, in the case of a <span>trusted notification</span>,
   the entire window could flash, or the browser's application icon
   could bounce or flash briefly, or a short sound effect could be
   played.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Notifications should include the following content:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The <var title="">title</var>, <var title="">subtitle</var>,
   and <var title="">description</var> strings passed to the
   method. They may be truncated or abbreviated if necessary.</li>

   <li>The <span title="meta-application-name">application
   name</span>, if available, or else the <span
   title="dom-document-title">document title</span>, of the
   <span>active document</span> of the <span title="script's browsing
   context">browsing context</span> of the <span
   title="concept-script">script</span> that invoked the method.</li>

   <li>An icon chosen from the <span title="external resource
   link">external resource links</span> of type <code
   title="rel-icon">icon</code>, if any are available.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>If a new notification from one <span>browsing context</span> has
  <var title="">title</var>, <var title="">subtitle</var>, and <var
  title="">description</var> strings that are identical to the <var
  title="">title</var>, <var title="">subtitle</var>, and <var
  title="">description</var> strings of an already-active notification
  from the same <span>browsing context</span> or another <span
  title="browsing context">browsing context</span> with the same
  <span>origin</span>, the user agent should not display the new
  notification, but should instead add an indicator to the
  already-active notification that another identical notification
  would otherwise have been shown.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For instance, if a user has his mail application open in three
   windows, and thus the same "New Mail" notification is fired three
   times each time a mail is received, instead of displaying three
   identical notifications each time, the user agent could just show
   one, with the title "New Mail x3".</p>

  </div>

  <p>Notifications should have a lifetime based on the platform
  conventions for notifications. However, the lifetime of a
  notification should not begin until the user has had the opportunity
  to see it, so if a notification is spawned for a <span>browsing
  context</span> that is hidden, it should be shown for its complete
  lifetime once the user brings that <span>browsing context</span>
  into view.</p>

  <p>User agents should support multiple notifications at once.</p>

  <p>User agents should support user interaction with notifications,
  if and as appropriate given the platform conventions. If a user
  activates a notification, and the <var title="">onclick</var>
  callback argument was present and is not null, then the <span
  title="script's browsing context">browsing context</span> of the
  <span title="concept-script">script</span> of the function given by
  <var title="">onclick</var> should be brought to the user's
  attention, and the <var title="">onclick</var> callback should then
  be invoked.</p>

  <h4>Client identification</h4>

  <p>In certain cases, despite the best efforts of the entire
  industry, Web browsers have bugs and limitations that Web authors
  are forced to work around.</p>

  <p>This section defines a collection of attributes that can be used
  to determine, from script, the kind of user agent in use, in order
  to work around these issues.</p>

  <p>Client detection should always be limited to detecting known
  current versions; future versions and unknown versions should always
  be assumed to be fully compliant.</p>

  <h4 id="custom-handlers">Custom protocol and content handlers</h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler"><code>registerProtocolHandler()</code></dfn>
  method allows Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers
  for particular protocols. For example, an online fax service could
  register itself as a handler of the <code>fax:</code> protocol (<a
  href="#refsRFC2806">[RFC2806]</a>), so that if the user clicks on
  such a link, he is given the opportunity to use that Web
  site. Analogously, the <dfn
  title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler"><code>registerContentHandler()</code></dfn>
  method allows Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers
  for content in a particular MIME type. For example, the same online
  fax service could register itself as a handler for
  <code>image/g3fax</code> files (<a
  href="#refsRFC1494">[RFC1494]</a>), so that if the user has no
  native application capable of handling G3 Facsimile byte streams,
  his Web browser can instead suggest he use that site to view the
  image.</p>

  <p>User agents may, within the constraints described in this
  section, do whatever they like when the methods are called. A UA
  could, for instance, prompt the user and offer the user the
  opportunity to add the site to a shortlist of handlers, or make the
  handlers his default, or cancel the request. UAs could provide such
  a UI through modal UI or through a non-modal transient notification
  interface. UAs could also simply silently collect the information,
  providing it only when relevant to the user.</p>

  <p>There is <a href="#sample-handler-impl">an example of how these
  methods could be presented to the user</a> below.</p>

  <p>The arguments to the methods have the following meanings and
  corresponding implementaion requirements:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><var title="">protocol</var> (<code title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler()</code> only)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A scheme, such as <code>ftp</code> or <code>fax</code>. The
    scheme must be compared in an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span>
    manner by user agents for the purposes of comparing with the
    scheme part of URLs that they consider against the list of
    registered handlers.</p>

    <p>The <var title="">protocol</var> value, if it contains a colon
    (as in "<code>ftp:</code>"), will never match anything, since
    schemes don't contain colons.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var title="">mimeType</var> (<code title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler()</code> only)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A MIME type, such as <code>model/vrml</code> or
    <code>text/richtext</code>. The MIME type must be compared in an
    <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> manner by user agents for the
    purposes of comparing with MIME types of documents that they
    consider against the list of registered handlers.</p>

    <p>User agents must compare the given values only to the MIME
    type/subtype parts of content types, not to the complete type
    including parameters. Thus, if <var title="">mimeType</var> values
    passed to this method include characters such as commas or
    whitespace, or include MIME parameters, then the handler being
    registered will never be used.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt><var title="">url</var></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The <span>URL</span> of the page that will handle the
    requests.</p>

    <p>When the user agent uses this URL, it must replace the first
    occurrence of the exact literal string "<code title="">%s</code>"
    with an escaped version of the <span>absolute URL</span> of the
    content in question (as defined below), then <span title="resolve
    a url">resolve</span> the resulting URL, relative to the <span
    title="script's base URL">base URL</span> of the <span>first
    script</span> at the time the <code
    title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler()</code>
    or <code
    title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler()</code>
    methods were invoked, and then <span>fetch</span> the resulting
    URL using the GET method (<span
    title="concept-http-equivalent-get">or equivalent</span> for
    non-HTTP URLs).</p>

    <p>To get the escaped version of the <span>absolute URL</span> of
    the content in question, the user agent must replace every
    character in that <span>absolute URL</span> that doesn't match the
    &lt;query&gt; production defined in RFC 3986 by the
    percent-encoded form of that character. <a
    href="#refsRFC3986">[RFC3986]</a></p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>If the user had visited a site at <code
     title="">http://example.com/</code> that made the following
     call:</p>

     <pre>navigator.registerContentHandler('application/x-soup', 'soup?url=%s', 'SoupWeb&trade;')</pre>

     <p>...and then, much later, while visiting <code
     title="">http://www.example.net/</code>, clicked on a link such
     as:</p>

     <pre>&lt;a href="chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup">Download our Chicken Kiwi soup!&lt;/a></pre>

     <p>...then, assuming this <code>chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup</code> file
     was served with the MIME type <code>application/x-soup</code>,
     the UA might navigate to the following URL:</p>

     <pre>http://example.com/soup?url=http://www.example.net/chickenk%C3%AFwi.soup</pre>

     <p>This site could then fetch the <code>chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup</code>
     file and do whatever it is that it does with soup (synthesize it
     and ship it to the user, or whatever).</p>

    </div>

   </dd>

   <dt><var title="">title</var></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A descriptive title of the handler, which the UA might use to
    remind the user what the site in question is.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>User agents should raise <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exceptions if
  the methods are called with <var title="">protocol</var> or <var
  title="">mimeType</var> values that the UA deems to be
  "privileged". For example, a site attempting to register a handler
  for <code>http</code> URLs or <code>text/html</code> content in a
  Web browser would likely cause an exception to be raised.</p>

  <p>User agents must raise a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception if the
  <var title="">url</var> argument passed to one of these methods does
  not contain the exact literal string "<code>%s</code>", or if <span
  title="resolve a url">resolving</span> the <var title="">url</var>
  argument with the first occurance of the string "<code
  title="">%s</code>" removed, relative to the <span>first
  script</span>'s <span title="script's base URL">base URL</span>, is
  not successful.</p>

  <p>User agents must not raise any other exceptions (other than
  binding-specific exceptions, such as for an incorrect number of
  arguments in an ECMAScript implementation).</p>

  <p>This section does not define how the pages registered by these
  methods are used, beyond the requirements on how to process the <var
  title="">url</var> value (see above). To some extent, the <span
  title="navigate">processing model for navigating across
  documents</span> defines some cases where these methods are
  relevant, but in general UAs may use this information wherever they
  would otherwise consider handing content to native plugins or helper
  applications.</p>

  <p>UAs must not use registered content handlers to handle content
  that was returned as part of a non-GET transaction (or rather, as
  part of any non-idempotent transaction), as the remote site would
  not be able to fetch the same data.</p>


  <h5>Security and privacy</h5>

  <p>These mechanisms can introduce a number of concerns, in
  particular privacy concerns.</p>

  <p><strong>Hijacking all Web usage.</strong> User agents should not
  allow protocols that are key to its normal operation, such as
  <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>, to be rerouted through
  third-party sites. This would allow a user's activities to be
  trivially tracked, and would allow user information, even in secure
  connections, to be collected.</p>

  <p><strong>Hijacking defaults.</strong> It is strongly recommended
  that user agents do not automatically change any defaults, as this
  could lead the user to send data to remote hosts that the user is
  not expecting. New handlers registering themselves should never
  automatically cause those sites to be used.</p>

  <p><strong>Registration spamming.</strong> User agents should
  consider the possibility that a site will attempt to register a
  large number of handlers, possibly from multiple domains (e.g. by
  redirecting through a series of pages each on a different domain,
  and each registering a handler for <code>video/mpeg</code> &mdash;
  analogous practices abusing other Web browser features have been
  used by pornography Web sites for many years). User agents should
  gracefully handle such hostile attempts, protecting the user.</p>

  <p><strong>Misleading titles.</strong> User agents should not rely
  wholly on the <var title="">title</var> argument to the methods when
  presenting the registered handlers to the user, since sites could
  easily lie. For example, a site <code>hostile.example.net</code>
  could claim that it was registering the "Cuddly Bear Happy Content
  Handler". User agents should therefore use the handler's domain in
  any UI along with any title.</p>

  <p><strong>Hostile handler metadata.</strong> User agents should
  protect against typical attacks against strings embedded in their
  interface, for example ensuring that markup or escape characters in
  such strings are not executed, that null bytes are properly handled,
  that over-long strings do not cause crashes or buffer overruns, and
  so forth.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking Intranet URLs.</strong> The mechanism described
  in this section can result in secret Intranet URLs being leaked, in
  the following manner:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>The user registers a third-party content handler as the default
   handler for a content type.</li>

   <li>The user then browses his corporate Intranet site and accesses
   a document that uses that content type.</li>

   <li>The user agent contacts the third party and hands the third
   party the URL to the Intranet content.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>No actual confidential file data is leaked in this manner, but
  the URLs themselves could contain confidential information. For
  example, the URL could be
  <code>http://www.corp.example.com/upcoming-aquisitions/the-sample-company.egf</code>,
  which might tell the third party that Example Corporation is
  intending to merge with The Sample Company. Implementors might wish
  to consider allowing administrators to disable this feature for
  certain subdomains, content types, or protocols.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking secure URLs.</strong> User agents should not send
  HTTPS URLs to third-party sites registered as content handlers, in
  the same way that user agents do not send <code
  title="http-referer">Referer</code> headers from secure sites to
  third-party sites.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking credentials.</strong> User agents must never send
  username or password information in the URLs that are escaped and
  included sent to the handler sites. User agents may even avoid
  attempting to pass to Web-based handlers the URLs of resources
  that are known to require authentication to access, as such sites
  would be unable to access the resources in question without
  prompting the user for credentials themselves (a practice that would
  require the user to know whether to trust the third-party handler, a
  decision many users are unable to make or even understand).</p>

  <p>A simple implementation of this feature for a desktop Web browser

  <h4 id="appcache">Application caches</h4>

  <p>An <dfn>application cache</dfn> is a set of cached resources
  consisting of:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>

    <p>One of more resources (including their out-of-band metadata,
    such as HTTP headers, if any), identified by URLs, each falling
    into one (or more) of the following categories:</p>

    <dl>
 
     <dt><dfn title="concept-appcache-master">Master entries</dfn>

     <dd>Documents that were added to the cache because a
     <span>browsing context</span> was <span

     title="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code> attribute.

 
     <dt><dfn title="concept-appcache-manifest">The manifest</dfn>

     <dd>The resource corresponding to the URL that was given in a
     master entry's <code>html</code> element's <code
     title="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code> attribute. The
     manifest is fetched and processed during the <span>application
     cache update process</span>. All the <span

     the <span title="same origin">same origin</span> as the manifest.

 
     <dt><dfn title="concept-appcache-explicit">Explicit entries</dfn>

     <dd>Resources that were listed in the cache's <span
     title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span>. Explicit
     entries can also be marked as <dfn
     title="concept-appcache-foreign">foreign</dfn>, which means that they
     have a <code title="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code>
     attribute but that it doesn't point at this cache's <span
     title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span>.

 
     <dt><dfn title="concept-appcache-fallback">Fallback entries</dfn>

     <dd>Resources that were listed in the cache's <span
     title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span> as fallback
     entries.

 
    </dl>

    <p class="note">A URL in the list can be flagged with multiple
    different types, and thus an entry can end up being categorized as
    multiple entries. For example, an entry can be a manfiest entry
    and an explicit entry at the same time, if the manifest is listed
    within the manifest.</p>

   </li>

   <li>Zero or more <dfn title="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback
   namespaces</dfn>: URLs, used as <span
   title="concept-appcache-matches-fallback">prefix match
   patterns</span>, each of which is mapped to a <span
   title="concept-appcache-fallback">fallback entry</span>. Each
   namespace URL has the <span>same origin</span> as <span
   title="concept-appcache-manifest">the manifest</span>.</li>

   <li>Zero or more URLs that form the <dfn
   title="concept-appcache-onlinewhitelist">online whitelist
   namespaces</dfn>.

  </ul>

  <p>Each <span>application cache</span> has a <dfn
  title="concept-appcache-completeness">completeness flag</dfn>, which is
  either <i>complete</i> or <i>incomplete</i>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>An <dfn>application cache group</dfn> is a group of <span
  title="application cache">application caches</span>, identified by
  the <span>absolute URL</span> of a resource <span
  title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span> which is used to
  populate the caches in the group.</p>

  <p>An <span>application cache</span> is <dfn
  title="concept-appcache-newer">newer</dfn> than another if it was
  created after the other (in other words, <span title="application
  cache">application caches</span> in an <span>application cache
  group</span> have a chronological order).</p>

  <p>Only the newest <span>application cache</span> in an
  <span>application cache group</span> can have its <span
  title="concept-appcache-completeness">completeness flag</span> set to
  <i>incomplete</i>, the others are always all <i>complete</i>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>application cache group</span> has an <dfn
  title="concept-appcache-status">update status</dfn>, which is one of
  the following: <i>idle</i>, <i>checking</i>, <i>downloading</i>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>relevant application cache</dfn> is an <span>application
  cache</span> that is the <span
  title="concept-appcache-newer">newest</span> in its <span
  title="application cache group">group</span> to be
  <i>complete</i>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>application cache group</span> has a <dfn
  title="concept-appcache-pending-masters">list of pending master
  entries</dfn>. Each entry in this list consists of a resource and a
  corresponding <code>Document</code> object. It is used during the
  update process to ensure that new master entries are cached.</p>

  <p>An <span>application cache group</span> can be marked as <dfn
  title="concept-appcache-obsolete">obsolete</dfn>, meaning that it
  must be ignored when looking at what <span title="application cache

  href="#parser-appcache">in the parser</a> and in the <span
  title="navigate">navigation</span> sections cause <span
  title="concept-appcache-init">cache selection</span> to occur early
  in the page load process.</p>

  <p>Multiple <span title="application cache">application
  caches</span> in different <span title="application cache
  group">application cache groups</span> can contain the same
  resource, e.g. if the manifests all reference that resource. If the
  user agent is to <dfn title="concept-appcache-selection">select an
  application cache</dfn> from a list of <span title="relevant
  application cache">relevant application caches</span> that contain a
  resource, that the user agent must use the application cache that
  the user most likely wants to see the resource from, taking into
  account the following:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>which application cache was most recently updated,

   <li>which application cache was being used to display the
   resource from which the user decided to look at the new resource,
   and

   <li>which application cache the user prefers.

  </ul>



  <h4 id="manifests">The cache manifest syntax</h4>


  <h5>A sample manifest</h5>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This example manifest requires two images and a style sheet to be
  cached and whitelists a CGI script.</p>

  <pre>CACHE MANIFEST
# the above line is required

# this is a comment
# there can be as many of these anywhere in the file
# they are all ignored
  # comments can have spaces before them
  # but must be alone on the line

# blank lines are ignored too

# these are files that need to be cached they can either be listed
# first, or a "CACHE:" header could be put before them, as is done
# lower down.
images/sound-icon.png
images/background.png
# note that each file has to be put on its own line

# here is a file for the online whitelist -- it isn't cached, and 
# references to this file will bypass the cache, always hitting the
# network (or trying to, if the user is offline).
NETWORK:
comm.cgi

# here is another set of files to cache, this time just the CSS file.
CACHE:
style/default.css</pre>


  <h5>Writing cache manifests</h5>

  <p>Manifests must be served using the <code
  title="">text/cache-manifest</code> MIME type. All resources served
  using the <code title="">text/cache-manifest</code> MIME type must
  follow the syntax of application cache manifests, as described in
  this section.</p>

  <p>An application cache manifest is a text file, whose text is
  encoded using UTF-8. Data in application cache manifests is
  line-based. Newlines must be represented by U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
  characters, U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters, or U+000D
  CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) U+000A LINE FEED (LF) pairs.</p>

  <p class="note">This is a willful double violation of RFC2046. <a
  href="#refsRFC2046">[RFC2046]</a></p>

  <p>The first line of an application cache manifest must consist of
  the string "CACHE", a single U+0020 SPACE character, the string
  "MANIFEST", and either a U+0020 SPACE character, a U+0009 CHARACTER
  TABULATION (tab) character, a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, or a
  U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character. The first line may optionally
  be preceded by a U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) character. If any
  other text is found on the first line, it is ignored.</p>

  <p>Subsequent lines, if any, must all be one of the following:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>A blank line
   <dd>
    <p>Blank lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and
    U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters only.</p>

   <dt>A comment
   <dd>
    <p>Comment lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and
    U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters, followed by a single
    U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (#) character, followed by zero or more
    characters other than U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and U+000D CARRIAGE
    RETURN (CR) characters.</p>

    <p class="note">Comments must be on a line on their own. If they
    were to be included on a line with a URL, the "#" would be
    mistaken for part of a fragment identifier.</p>

   <dt>A section header
   <dd>
    <p>Section headers change the current section. There are three
    possible section headers:

    <dl>

     <dt><code>CACHE:</code>
     <dd>Switches to the explicit section.

     <dt><code>FALLBACK:</code>
     <dd>Switches to the fallback section.

     <dt><code>NETWORK:</code>
     <dd>Switches to the online whitelist section.

    </dl>

    <p>Section header lines must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE
    and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters, followed by one
    of the names above (including the U+003A COLON (:) character)
    followed by zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER
    TABULATION (tab) characters.</p>

    <p>Ironically, by default, the current section is the explicit
    section.</p>

   <dt>Data for the current section
   <dd>
    <p>The format that data lines must take depends on the current
    section.</p>

    <p>When the current section is the explicit section or the online
    whitelist section, data lines must consist of zero or more U+0020
    SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters, a
    <span>valid URL</span> identifying a resource other than the
    manifest itself, and then zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009
    CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters.</p>

    <p>When the current section is the fallback section, data lines
    must consist of zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER
    TABULATION (tab) characters, a <span>valid URL</span> identifying
    a resource other than the manifest itself, one or more U+0020
    SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters, another
    <span>valid URL</span> identifying a resource other than the
    manifest itself, and then zero or more U+0020 SPACE and U+0009
    CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters.</p>

    <p class="note">The URLs in data lines can't be empty strings,
    since those would be relative URLs to the manifest itself. Such
    lines would be confused with blank or invalid lines, anyway.</p>

  </dl>

  <p>Manifests may contain sections more than once. Sections may be
  empty.</p>

  <p>URLs that are to be fallback pages associated with <span
  title="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback namespaces</span>, and
  those namespaces themselves, must be given in fallback sections,
  with the namespace being the first URL of the data line, and the
  corresponding fallback page being the second URL. All the other
  pages to be cached must be listed in explicit sections.</p>

  <p><span title="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">Fallback
  namespaces</span> and <span
  title="concept-appcache-fallback">fallback entries</span> must have
  the <span>same origin</span> as the manifest itself.</p>

  <p>A <span title="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback
  namespace</span> must not be listed more than once.</p>

  <p>URLs that the user agent is to put into the <span
  title="concept-appcache-onlinewhitelist">online whitelist</span>
  must all be specified in online whitelist sections. (This is needed
  for any URL that the page is intending to use to communicate back to
  the server.)</p>

  <p>Relative URLs must be given relative to the manifest's own
  URL.</p>

  <p>URLs in manifests must not have fragment identifiers (i.e. the
  U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character isn't allowed in URLs in
  manifests).</p>


  <h5>Parsing cache manifests</h5>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>parse a manifest</dfn>, it means
  that the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
   
   <li><p>The user agent must decode the byte stream corresponding with
   the manifest to be parsed, treating it as UTF-8. Bytes or sequences
   of bytes that are not valid UTF-8 sequences must be interpreted as
   a U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. <!--All U+0000 NULL characters must
   be replaced by U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs. (this isn't black-box
   testable since neither U+0000 nor U+FFFD are valid anywhere in the
   syntax and thus both will be treated the same anyway)--></p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">base URL</var> be the <span>absolute
   URL</span> representing the manifest.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">explicit URLs</var> be an initially empty
   list of <span title="concept-appcache-explicit">explicit
   entries</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">fallback URLs</var> be an initially empty
   mapping of <span title="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback
   namespaces</span> to <span
   title="concept-appcache-fallback">fallback entries</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">online whitelist URLs</var> be an
   initially empty list of URLs for a <span
   title="concept-appcache-onlinewhitelist">online
   whitelist</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the decoded text of the
   manifest's byte stream.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">position</var> be a pointer into <var
   title="">input</var>, initially pointing at the first
   character.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">position</var> is pointing at a U+FEFF BYTE
   ORDER MARK (BOM) character, then advance <var
   title="">position</var> to the next character.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the characters starting from <var title="">position</var>
   are "CACHE", followed by a U+0020 SPACE character, followed by
   "MANIFEST", then advance <var title="">position</var> to the next
   character after those. Otherwise, this isn't a cache manifest;
   abort this algorithm with a failure while checking for the magic
   signature.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the character at <var title="">position</var> is neither
   a U+0020 SPACE character, a U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab)
   character, U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, nor a U+000D CARRIAGE
   RETURN (CR) character, then this isn't a cache manifest; abort this
   algorithm with a failure while checking for the magic
   signature.</p></li>

   <li><p>This is a cache manifest. The algorithm cannot fail beyond
   this point (though bogus lines can get ignored).</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Collect a sequence of characters</span> that are
   <em>not</em> U+000A LINE FEED (LF) or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
   characters, and ignore those characters. (Extra text on the first
   line, after the signature, is ignored.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">mode</var> be "explicit".</p></li>

   <li><p><em>Start of line</em>: If <var title="">position</var> is
   past the end of <var title="">input</var>, then jump to the last
   step. Otherwise, <span>collect a sequence of characters</span> that
   are U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), U+0020
   SPACE, or U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters.</p></li>
   <!-- strips leading spaces, ignores space-only lines, ignores blank lines -->

   <li><p>Now, <span>collect a sequence of characters</span> that are
   <em>not</em> U+000A LINE FEED (LF) or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
   characters, and let the result be <var
   title="">line</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Drop any trailing U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 CHARACTER
   TABULATION (tab) characters at the end of <var
   title="">line</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">line</var> is the empty string, then jump
   back to the step labeled "start of line".</p></li>

   <li><p>If the first character in <var title="">line</var> is a
   U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (#) character, then jump back to the step
   labeled "start of line".</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">line</var> equals "CACHE:" (the word
   "CACHE" followed by a U+003A COLON (:) character), then set <var
   title="">mode</var> to "explicit" and jump back to the step
   labeled "start of line".</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">line</var> equals "FALLBACK:" (the word
   "FALLBACK" followed by a U+003A COLON (:) character), then set <var
   title="">mode</var> to "fallback" and jump back to the step
   labeled "start of line".</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">line</var> equals "NETWORK:" (the word
   "NETWORK" followed by a U+003A COLON (:) character), then set <var
   title="">mode</var> to "online whitelist" and jump back to the step
   labeled "start of line".</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">line</var> ends with a U+003A COLON (:)
   character, then set <var title="">mode</var> to "unknown" and jump
   back to the step labeled "start of line".</p></li>

   <li><p>This is either a data line or it is syntactically
   incorrect.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">position</var> be a pointer into <var
   title="">line</var>, initially pointing at the start of the
   string.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">tokens</var> be a list of strings,

    <p>While <var title="">position</var> doesn't point past the end

    <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var title="">current token</var> be an empty

     <li><p>While <var title="">position</var> doesn't point past the
     end of <var title="">line</var> and the character at <var
     title="">position</var> is neither a U+0020 SPACE nor a U+0009
     CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) character, add the character at <var
     title="">position</var> to <var title="">current token</var> and
     advance <var title="">position</var> to the next character in
     <var title="">input</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Add <var title="">current token</var> to the <var

  <h4>Updating an application cache</h4>

  <p>When the user agent is required (by other parts of this
  specification) to start the <dfn>application cache update
  process</dfn> for an <span>absolute URL</span> purported to identify
  a <span title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span>, or for an
  <span>application cache group</span>, potentially given a particular
  <span>browsing context</span>, and potentially given a new <span
  title="concept-appcache-master">master</span> resource, the user
  agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Atomically, so as to avoid race conditions, perform the
    following substeps:</p>

      <p class="note">This is intended to allow user agents to expire

     information -->

     <li>

      <p><span>Fetch</span> the resource. If this is an <span

      use the <span title="concept-appcache-newer">newest</span>

      group</var> as an HTTP cache, and honor HTTP caching semantics
      (such as expiration, ETags, and so forth) with respect to that
      cache. User agents may also have other caches in place that are
      also honored.</p>

      <p class="note">If the resource in question is already being
      downloaded for other reasons then the existing download process
      can be used for the purposes of this step, as defined by the
      <span title="fetch">fetching</span> algorithm.</p>

      <p class="example">An example of a resource that might already
      be being downloaded is a large image on a Web page that is being
      seen for the first time. The image would get downloaded to
      satisfy the <code>img</code> element on the page, as well as
      being listed in the cache manifest. According to the rules for
      <span title="fetch">fetching</span> that image only need be
      downloaded once, and it can be used both for the cache and for
      the rendered Web page.</p>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>If the previous step fails (e.g. the server returns a 4xx or
      5xx response <span title="concept-http-equivalent-codes">or
      equivalent</span>, or there is a DNS error, or the connection
      times out, or the user cancels the download), or if the server
      returned a redirect, then run the first appropriate step from
      the following list:</p>

      <dl class="switch">

       <dt>If the URL being processed was flagged as an "explicit
       entry" or a "fallback entry"</dt>

       <dd>

        <p>Run the <span>cache failure steps</span>.</p>

        <p class="note">Redirects are fatal because they are either
        indicative of a network problem (e.g. a captive portal); or
        would allow resources to be added to the cache under URLs that
        differ from any URL that the networking model will allow
        access to, leaving orphan entries; or would allow resources to
        be stored under URLs different than their true URLs. All of
        these situations are bad.</p>

       </dd>

       <dt>If the error was a 404 or 410 HTTP response <span
       title="concept-http-equivalent-codes">or equivalent</span></dt>

       <dd>

        <p>Skip this resource. It is dropped from the cache.</p>

       </dd>

       <dt>Otherwise</dt>

       <dd>

        <p>Copy the resource and its metadata from the <span

       </dd>

      <p>User agents may warn the user of these errors as an aid to
      development.</p>

      <p class="note">These rules make errors for resources listed in
      the manifest fatal, while making it possible for other resources
      to be removed from caches when they are removed from the server,

      server-side errors.</p>

  <h4>Matching a fallback namespace</h4>

  <p>A URL <dfn title="concept-appcache-matches-fallback">matches a
  fallback namespace</dfn> if there exists a <span>relevant
  application cache</span> whose <span
  title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span>'s URL has the
  <span>same origin</span> as the URL in question, and that has a
  <span title="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback namespace</span>
  that is a <span>prefix match</span> for the URL being examined. If
  multiple fallback namespaces match the same URL, the longest one is
  the one that matches. A URL looking for an fallback namespace can
  match more than one application cache at a time, but only matches
  one namespace in each cache.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>If a manifest <code
   title="">http://example.com/app1/manifest</code> declares that
   <code title="">http://example.com/resources/images</code> is a
   fallback namespace, and the user navigates to <code
   title="">HTTP://EXAMPLE.COM:80/resources/images/cat.png</code>,
   then the user agent will decide that the application cache
   identified by <code
   title="">http://example.com/app1/manifest</code> contains a
   namespace with a match for that URL.</p>

   <!-- "resolve a url" canonicalises the case for the scheme and host
   and removes the port if it is the default -->

  <h4>The application cache selection algorithm</h4>

  <p>When the <dfn title="concept-appcache-init">application cache
  selection algorithm</dfn> algorithm is invoked with a
  <code>Document</code> <var title="">document</var>, a flag <var
  title="">document-is-markup</var> which can be true or false, and
  optionally a manifest <span>URL</span> <var title="">manifest
  URL</var>, the user agent must run the first applicable set of steps
  from the following list:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the flag <var title="">document-is-markup</var> is true, and
   <var title="">document</var> was loaded from an <span>application
   cache</span>, and there is no <var title="">manifest URL</var></dt>

   <dt>If the flag <var title="">document-is-markup</var> is true, If
   <var title="">document</var> was loaded from an <span>application
   cache</span>, and the URL of the <span
   title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span> of that cache's
   <span>application cache group</span> is <em>not</em> the same as
   <var title="">manifest URL</var></dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Mark the entry for the resource from which <var
    title="">document</var> was taken in the <span>application
    cache</span> from which it was loaded as <span
    title="concept-appcache-foreign">foreign</span>.</p>

    <p>Restart the current navigation from the top of the <span
    title="navigate">navigation algorithm</span>, undoing any changes
    that were made as part of the initial load (changes can be avoided
    by ensuring that the step to <span>update the session history with
    the new page</span> is only ever completed <em>after</em> this
    <span title="concept-appcache-init">application cache selection
    algorithm</span> is run, though this is not required).</p>

    <p class="note">The navigation will not result in the same
    resource being loaded, because "foreign" entries are never picked
    during navigation.</p>

    <p>User agents may notify the user of the inconsistency between
    the cache manifest and the document's own metadata, to aid in
    application development.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>If <var title="">document</var> was loaded from an
   <span>application cache</span><!--[redundant], and the URL of the
   <span title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span> of that

  <h5 id="changesToNetworkingModel">Changes to the networking model</h5>

  <p>When a <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>active
  document</span> is associated with an <span>application cache</span>
  whose <span title="concept-appcache-completeness">completeness
  flag</span> is <i>complete</i>, any and all loads for resources in
  that <span>browsing context</span> other than those for <span
  title="child browsing context">child browsing contexts</span> must
  go through the following steps instead of immediately invoking the
  mechanisms appropriate to that resource's scheme:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the resource is not to be fetched using the HTTP GET
   mechanism <span title="concept-http-equivalent-get">or
   equivalent</span>, or if it has a <span title="javascript
   protocol"><code title="">javascript:</code> URL</span>, then
   <span>fetch</span> the resource normally and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the resource's URL is <span
   title="concept-appcache-master">a master entry</span>, <span
   title="concept-appcache-manifest">the manifest</span>, <span
   title="concept-appcache-explicit">an explicit entry</span>, or
   <span title="concept-appcache-fallback">a fallback entry</span> in
   the <span>application cache</span>, then get the resource from the
   cache (instead of fetching it), and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the resource's URL has the <span>same origin</span> as the
    manifest's URL, and there is a <span
    title="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback namespace</span> in
    the <span>application cache</span> that is a <span>prefix
    match</span> for the resource's URL, then:</p>

    <p><span>Fetch</span> the resource normally. If this results in a
    redirect to a resource with another <span>origin</span>
    (indicative of a captive portal), or a 4xx or 5xx status code
    <span title="concept-http-equivalent-codes">or equivalent</span>,
    or if there were network errors (but not if the user canceled the
    download), then instead get, from the cache, the resource of the
    <span title="concept-appcache-fallback">fallback entry</span>
    corresponding to the matched namespace. Abort these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If there is an entry in the <span>application cache</span>'s
   <span title="concept-appcache-onlinewhitelist">online
   whitelist</span> that has the <span>same origin</span> as the
   resource's URL and that is a <span>prefix match</span> for the
   resource's URL, then <span>fetch</span> the resource normally and
   abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Fail the resource load.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">The above algorithm ensures that resources that are
  not present in the <span
  title="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span> will always fail
  to load (at least, after the <span>application cache</span> has been
  primed the first time), making the testing of offline applications
  simpler.</p>

  <p>If the <dfn

  <p>On the other hand, when the value that would be returned by the

  of the <code>Window</code> changes from false to true, the user
  agent must <span>fire a simple event</span> called <dfn
  title="event-online"><code>online</code></dfn> at the
  <code>Window</code> object.</p>

  <p class="note">This attribute is inherently unreliable. A computer
  can be connected to a network without having Internet access.</p>



  <h3 id="history">Session history and navigation</h3>

  <h4>The session history of browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>The sequence of <code>Document</code>s in a <span>browsing
  context</span> is its <dfn>session history</dfn>.</p>

  <p><code>History</code> objects provide a representation of the
  pages in the session history of <span title="browsing
  context">browsing contexts</span>. Each <span>browsing
  context</span>, including <span>nested browsing context</span>, has
  a distinct session history.</p>

  <p>Each <code>Document</code> object in a <span>browsing
  context</span>'s <span>session history</span> is associated with a
  unique instance of the <code>History</code> object, although they
  all must model the same underlying <span>session history</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-history"><code>history</code></dfn> attribute
  of the <code>Window</code> interface must return the object
  implementing the <code>History</code> interface for that
  <code>Window</code> object's <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p><code>History</code> objects represent their <span>browsing
  context</span>'s session history as a flat list of <span
  title="session history entry">session history entries</span>. Each
  <dfn>session history entry</dfn> consists of either a
  <span>URL</span> or a <span>state object</span>, or both, and may in
  addition have a title, a <code>Document</code> object, form data, a
  scroll position, and other information associated with it.</p>

  <p class="note">This does not imply that the user interface need be
  linear. See the <a href="#history-notes">notes below</a>.</p>

  <p>URLs without associated <span title="state object">state
  objects</span> are added to the session history as the user (or
  script) navigates from page to page.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>state object</dfn> is an object representing a user
  interface state.</p>

  <p>Pages can <span title="dom-history-pushState">add</span> <span
  title="state object">state objects</span> between their entry in the
  session history and the next ("forward") entry. These are then <span
  title="event-popstate">returned to the script</span> when the user
  (or script) goes back in the history, thus enabling authors to use
  the "navigation" metaphor even in one-page applications.</p>

  <p>At any point, one of the entries in the session history is the
  <dfn>current entry</dfn>. This is the entry representing the
  <span>active document</span> of the <span>browsing
  context</span>. The <span>current entry</span> is usually an entry
  for the <span title="dom-location-href">location</span> of the
  <code>Document</code>. However, it can also be one of the entries
  for <span title="state object">state objects</span> added to the
  history by that document.</p>

  <p>Entries that consist of <span title="state object">state
  objects</span> share the same <code>Document</code> as the entry for
  the page that was active when they were added.</p>

  <p>Contiguous entries that differ just by fragment identifier also
  share the same <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">All entries that share the same
  <code>Document</code> (and that are therefore merely different
  states of one particular document) are contiguous by definition.</p>

  <p>User agents may <span title="discard a Document">discard</span>
  the <code>Document</code> objects of entries other than the
  <span>current entry</span> that are not referenced from any script,
  reloading the pages afresh when the user or script navigates back to
  such pages. This specification does not specify when user agents
  should discard <code>Document</code> objects and when they should
  cache them.</p>

  <p>Entries that have had their <code>Document</code> objects
  discarded must, for the purposes of the algorithms given below, act
  as if they had not. When the user or script navigates back or
  forwards to a page which has no in-memory DOM objects, any other
  entries that shared the same <code>Document</code> object with it
  must share the new object as well.</p>

  <p>When state object entries are added, a URL can be provided. This
  URL is used to replace the state object entry if the
  <code>Document</code> is evicted.</p>


  <h4>The <code>History</code> interface</h4>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>History</dfn> {
  readonly attribute long <span title="dom-history-length">length</span>;
  void <span title="dom-history-go">go</span>([Optional] in long delta);
  void <span title="dom-history-back">back</span>();
  void <span title="dom-history-forward">forward</span>();
  void <span title="dom-history-pushState">pushState</span>(in any data, in DOMString title, [Optional] in DOMString url);
  void <span title="dom-history-clearState">clearState</span>();
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-history-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute of the <code>History</code> interface must return the
  number of entries in this <span>session history</span>.</p>

  <p>The actual entries are not accessible from script.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-history-go"><code>go(<var
  title="">delta</var>)</code></dfn> method causes the UA to move the
  number of steps specified by <var title="">delta</var> in the
  session history.</p>

  <p>If the <var title="">delta</var> is zero, or if the argument is
  omitted, then the user agent must act as if the <code
  title="dom-location-reload">location.reload()</code> method was
  called instead.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the index of the <span>current entry</span> plus
  <var title="">delta</var> is less than zero or greater than or equal
  to the <span title="dom-history-length">number of items in the
  session history</span>, then the user agent must do nothing.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the user agent must cause the current <span>browsing
  context</span> to <span>traverse the history</span> to the specified
  entry. The <i>specified entry</i> is the one whose index equals the
  index of the <span>current entry</span> plus <var
  title="">delta</var>.</p>

  <p>When the user navigates through a <span>browsing context</span>,
  e.g. using a browser's back and forward buttons, the user agent must
  translate this action into the equivalent invocations of the <code
  title="dom-history-go">history.go(<var title="">delta</var>)</code>
  method on the various affected <code
  title="dom-window">window</code> objects.</p>

  <p>Some of the other members of the <code>History</code> interface
  are defined in terms of the <code title="dom-history-go">go()</code>
  method, as follows:</p>

  <table>
   <tr>
    <th>Member</th>
    <th>Definition</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><dfn title="dom-history-back"><code>back()</code></dfn></td>
    <td>Must do the same as <code title="dom-history-go">go(-1)</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><dfn title="dom-history-forward"><code>forward()</code></dfn></td>
    <td>Must do the same as <code title="dom-history-go">go(1)</code></td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 
  <p>The <dfn title="dom-history-pushState"><code>pushState(<var
  title="">data</var>, <var title="">title</var>, <var
  title="">url</var>)</code></dfn> method adds a state object to the
  history.</p>

  <p>When this method is invoked, the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">clone data</var> be a <span>structured
   clone</span> of the specified <var title="">data</var>. If this
   throws an exception, then rethrow that exception and abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If a third argument is specified, run these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     third argument, relative to the <span>first script</span>'s <span
     title="script's base URL">base URL</span>.</li>

     <li>If that fails, raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception and
     abort the <code title="dom-history-pushState">pushState()</code>
     steps.</li>

     <li>Compare the resulting <span>absolute URL</span> to <span>the
     document's address</span>. If any part of these two <span
     title="URL">URLs</span> differ other than the <span

     raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception and abort the <code
     title="dom-history-pushState">pushState()</code> steps.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>For the purposes of the comparison in the above substeps, the
    <span title="url-path">&lt;path&gt;</span> and <span
    title="url-query">&lt;query&gt;</span> components can only be the
    same if the URLs use a hierarchical <span

   </li>

   <li><p>Remove from the <span>session history</span> any entries for
   the <code>Document</code> from the entry after the <span>current
   entry</span> up to the last entry in the session history that
   references the same <code>Document</code> object, if any. If the
   <span>current entry</span> is the last entry in the session
   history, or if there are no entries after the <span>current
   entry</span> that reference the same <code>Document</code> object,
   then no entries are removed.</p></li>

   <li><p>Add a state object entry to the session history, after the
   <span>current entry</span>, with <var title="">cloned data</var> as
   the state object, the given <var title="">title</var> as the title,
   and, if the third argument is present, the <span>absolute
   URL</span> that was found earlier in this algorithm as the
   <span>URL</span> of the entry.</p></li>

   <!-- XXX update the current address as per bug 6437 -->

   added entry.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">The <var title="">title</var> is purely
  advisory. User agents might use the title in the user interface.</p>

  <p>User agents may limit the number of state objects added to the
  session history per page. If a page hits the UA-defined limit, user
  agents must remove the entry immediately after the first entry for
  that <code>Document</code> object in the session history after
  having added the new entry. (Thus the state history acts as a FIFO
  buffer for eviction, but as a LIFO buffer for navigation.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-history-clearState"><code>clearState()</code></dfn>
  method removes all the state objects for the <code>Document</code>
  object from the session history.</p>

  <p>When this method is invoked, the user agent must remove from the
  session history all the entries from the first state object entry
  for that <code>Document</code> object up to the last entry that
  references that same <code>Document</code> object, if any.</p>

  <p>Then, if the <span>current entry</span> was removed in the
  previous step, the <span>current entry</span> must be set to the
  last entry for that <code>Document</code> object in the session
  history.</p>


  <h4><dfn title="activate the state object">Activating state object entries</dfn></h4>

  <p>When an entry in the session history is activated (which happens

  <h4 id="history-notes">Implementation notes for session history</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>The <code>History</code> interface is not meant to place
  restrictions on how implementations represent the session history to
  the user.</p>

  <p>For example, session history could be implemented in a tree-like
  manner, with each page having multiple "forward" pages. This
  specification doesn't define how the linear list of pages in the
  <code title="dom-history">history</code> object are derived from the
  actual session history as seen from the user's perspective.</p>

  <p>Similarly, a page containing two <code>iframe</code>s has a <code
  title="dom-history">history</code> object distinct from the
  <code>iframe</code>s' <code title="dom-history">history</code>
  objects, despite the fact that typical Web browsers present the user
  with just one "Back" button, with a session history that interleaves
  the navigation of the two inner frames and the outer page.</p>

  <p><strong>Security:</strong> It is suggested that to avoid letting
  a page "hijack" the history navigation facilities of a UA by abusing
  <code title="dom-history-pushState">pushState()</code>, the UA
  provide the user with a way to jump back to the previous page
  (rather than just going back to the previous state). For example,
  the back button could have a drop down showing just the pages in the
  session history, and not showing any of the states. Similarly, an
  aural browser could have two "back" commands, one that goes back to
  the previous state, and one that jumps straight back to the previous
  page.</p>

  <p>In addition, a user agent could ignore calls to <code
  title="dom-history-pushState">pushState()</code> that are invoked on
  a timer, or from event handlers that do not represent a clear user
  action, or that are invoked in rapid succession.</p>




  <h3>Browsing the Web</h3>

  <h4>Navigating across documents</h4>

  <p>Certain actions cause the <span>browsing context</span> to
  <i>navigate</i> to a new resource. Navigation always involves
  <dfn>source browsing context</dfn>, which is the browsing context
  which was responsible for starting the navigation.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, <span title="following
  hyperlinks">following a hyperlink</span>, <span
  title="concept-form-submit">form submission</span>, and the <code
  title="dom-open">window.open()</code> and <code
  title="dom-location-assign">location.assign()</code> methods can all
  cause a browsing context to navigate.</p>

  <p>A user agent may provide various ways for the user to explicitly
  cause a browsing context to navigate, in addition to those defined
  in this specification.</p>

  <p>When a browsing context is <dfn title="navigate">navigated</dfn>
  to a new resource, the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li id="sandboxLinks"><p>If the <span>source browsing
   context</span> is not the same as the <span>browsing context</span>
   being navigated, and the <span>source browsing context</span> is
   not one of the <span title="ancestor browsing context">ancestor
   browsing contexts</span> of the <span>browsing context</span> being
   navigated, and the <span>source browsing context</span> has its
   <span>sandboxed navigation browsing context flag</span> set, then
   abort these steps. The user agent may offer to open the new
   resource in a new <span>top-level browsing context</span> or in the
   <span>top-level browsing context</span> of the <span>source
   browsing context</span>, at the user's option, in which case the
   user agent must <span>navigate</span> that designated
   <span>top-level browsing context</span> to the new resource as if
   the user had requested it independently.</p></li>

   <li id="seamlessLinks"><p>If the <span>source browsing
   context</span> is the same as the <span>browsing context</span>
   being navigated, and this browsing context has its <span>seamless
   browsing context flag</span> set, then find the nearest
   <span>ancestor browsing context</span> that does not have its
   <span>seamless browsing context flag</span> set, and continue these
   steps as if <em>that</em> <span>browsing context</span> was the one
   that was going to be <span title="navigate">navigated</span>
   instead.</p></li>

   <li><p>Cancel any preexisting attempt to navigate the
   <span>browsing context</span>.</p></li>

   <li id="navigate-fragid-step"><p><i>Fragment identifiers</i>: If
   the <span>absolute URL</span> of the new resource is the same as
   the <span title="the document's address">address</span> of the
   <span>active document</span> of the <span>browsing context</span>
   being navigated, ignoring any <span
   title="url-fragment">&lt;fragment&gt;</span> components of those
   <span title="URL">URLs</span>, and the new resource is to be
   fetched using HTTP GET <span title="concept-http-equivalent-get">or
   equivalent</span>, then <span title="navigate-fragid">navigate to
   that fragment identifier</span> and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the new resource is to be handled by displaying some sort
   of inline content, e.g. an error message because the specified
   scheme is not one of the supported protocols, or an inline prompt
   to allow the user to select <span
   title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">a registered
   handler</span> for the given scheme, then <span
   title="navigate-ua-inline">display the inline content</span> and
   abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the new resource is to be handled using a mechanism that
   does not affect the browsing context, e.g. ignoring the navigation
   request altogether because the specified scheme is not one of the
   supported protocols, then abort these steps and proceed with that
   mechanism instead.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the new resource is to be fetched using HTTP GET <span
    title="concept-http-equivalent-get">or equivalent</span>, then
    check if there are any <span title="relevant application
    cache">relevant application caches</span> that are identified by a
    URL with the <span>same origin</span> as the URL in question, and
    that have this URL as one of their entries, excluding entries
    marked as <span
    title="concept-appcache-foreign">foreign</span>. If so, then the
    user agent must then get the resource from the <span
    title="concept-appcache-selection">most appropriate application
    cache</span> of those that match.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, imagine an HTML page with an
    associated application cache displaying an image and a form, where
    the image is also used by several other application caches. If the
    user right-clicks on the image and chooses "View Image", then the
    user agent could decide to show the image from any of those
    caches, but it is likely that the most useful cache for the user
    would be the one that was used for the aforementioned HTML
    page. On the other hand, if the user submits the form, and the
    form does a POST submission, then the user agent will not use an
    application cache at all; the submission will be made to the
    network.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, <span>fetch</span> the new resource, if it has not
    already been obtained<!-- it's obtained by <object>, for instance
    -->. If the resource is being fetched using HTTP, and the method
    is not GET<!-- or HEAD (but that can't happen) -->, then the user
    agent must include an <code title="http-origin">XXX-Origin</code>
    header whose value is determined as follows:</p>

    <dl class="switch">

     <dt>If the <span title="navigate">navigation</span> algorithm has
     so far contacted more than one <span>origin</span></dt>
     <dt>If there is no <span>source browsing context</span></dt>

     <dd>The value must be the string "<code title="">null</code>".</dd>

     <dt>Otherwise</dt>

     <dd>The value must be the <span title="ASCII serialization of an
     origin">ASCII serialization</span> of the <span>origin</span> of
     the <span>active document</span> of the <span>source browsing
     context</span> at the time the navigation was started.</dd>

    </dl>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If fetching the resource is synchronous (i.e. for <span
    title="javascript protocol"><code title="">javascript:</code>
    URLs</span> and <code>about:blank</code>), then this must be
    synchronous, but if fetching the resource depends on external
    resources, as it usually does for URLs that use HTTP or other
    networking protocols, then at this point the user agents must
    yield to whatever <span title="concept-script">script</span> invoked the navigation steps, if they
    were invoked by script.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If fetching the resource results in a redirect, return to <a
    href="#navigate-fragid-step">the step labeled "fragment
    identifiers"</a> with the new resource.</p>

    <p class="note">Cross-origin redirects cause the <code
    title="http-origin">XXX-Origin</code> header to become "<code
    title="">null</code>" on subsequent requests in the chain.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Wait for one or more bytes to be available or for the user
   agent to establish that the resource in question is empty. During
   this time, the user agent may allow the user to cancel this
   navigation attempt or start other navigation attempts.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the resource was not fetched from an <span>application
    cache</span>, and was to be fetched using HTTP GET <span
    title="concept-http-equivalent-get">or equivalent</span>, and its
    URL <span title="concept-appcache-matches-fallback">matches the
    fallback namespace</span> of one or more <span title="relevant
    application cache">relevant application caches</span>, and the
    user didn't cancel the navigation attempt during the previous
    step, and the navigation attempt failed (e.g. the server returned
    a 4xx or 5xx status code <span
    title="concept-http-equivalent-codes">or equivalent</span>, or
    there was a DNS error), then:</p> <!-- note that a redirect can
    never reach this point as it is handled earlier, meaning that a
    captive portal captures URLs in fallback namespaces and you can't
    ever get to the fallback file of a resource if you have a captive
    portal -->

    <p>Let <var title="">candidate</var> be the <span
    title="concept-appcache-fallback">fallback resource</span>
    specified for the <span
    title="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback namespace</span> in
    question. If multiple application caches match, the user agent
    must use the fallback of the <span
    title="concept-appcache-selection">most appropriate application
    cache</span> of those that match.</p>

    <p>If <var title="">candidate</var> is not marked as <span
    title="concept-appcache-foreign">foreign</span>, then the user
    agent must discard the failed load and instead continue along
    these steps using <var title="">candidate</var> as the
    resource. <span>The document's address</span>, if appropriate,
    will still be the originally requested URL, not the fallback URL,
    but the user agent may indicate to the user that the original page
    load failed, that the page used was a fallback resource, and what
    the URL of the fallback resource actually is.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the document's out-of-band metadata (e.g. HTTP headers),
   not counting any <span title="Content-Type">type information</span>
   (such as the Content-Type HTTP header), requires some sort of
   processing that will not affect the browsing context, then perform
   that processing and abort these steps.</p>

   <div class="note">
    <p>Such processing might be triggered by, amongst other things, the
    following:</p>
    <ul class="brief">
     <li>HTTP status codes (e.g. 204 No Content or 205 Reset Content)</li>
     <li>HTTP Content-Disposition headers</li>
     <li>Network errors</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   
    <!-- XXX should we define 205 processing here? e.g. reset all forms? -->

    <p>HTTP 401 responses that do not include a challenge recognised
    by the user agent must be processed as if they had no challenge,
    e.g. rendering the entity body as if the response had been 200
    OK.</p>

    <p>User agents may show the entity body of an HTTP 401 response
    even when the response do include a recognised challenge, with the
    option to login being included in a non-modal fashion, to enable
    the information provided by the server to be used by the user
    before authenticating. Similarly, user agents should allow the

  <h4 id="read-html"><dfn title="navigate-html">Page load processing model for HTML files</dfn></h4>

  <p>When an HTML document is to be loaded in a <span>browsing
  context</span>, the user agent must create a <code>Document</code>
  object, mark it as being an <span title="HTML documents">HTML
  document</span>, create an <span>HTML parser</span>, associate it
  with the document, and begin to use the bytes provided for the
  document as the <span>input stream</span> for that parser.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>input stream</span> converts bytes into
  characters for use in the <span>tokeniser</span><!-- XXX xref
  -->. This process relies, in part, on character encoding information
  found in the real <span title="Content-Type">Content-Type
  metadata</span> of the resource; the "sniffed type" is not used for
  this purpose.</p>

  <!-- next two paragraphs are nearly identical to the navigate-text
  section, keep them in sync -->

  <p>When no more bytes are available, an EOF character is implied,
  which eventually causes a <code title="event-load">load</code> event
  to be fired.</p>

  <p>After creating the <code>Document</code> object, but potentially
  before the page has finished parsing, the user agent must
  <span>update the session history with the new page</span>.</p>

  <h4 id="read-xml"><dfn title="navigate-xml">Page load processing model for XML files</dfn></h4>

  <p>When faced with displaying an XML file inline, user agents must
  first create a <code>Document</code> object, following the
  requirements of the XML and Namespaces in XML recommendations, RFC
  3023, DOM3 Core, and other relevant specifications. <a
  href="#refsXML">[XML]</a> <a href="#refsXMLNS">[XMLNS]</a> <a
  href="#refsRFC3023">[RFC3023]</a> <a
  href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></p>

  <p>The actual HTTP headers and other metadata, not the headers as
  mutated or implied by the algorithms given in this specification,
  are the ones that must be used when determining the character
  encoding according to the rules given in the above
  specifications. Once the character encoding is established, the
  <span>document's character encoding</span> must be set to that
  character encoding.</p>

  <p>If the root element, as parsed according to the XML
  specifications cited above, is found to be an <code>html</code>
  element with an attribute <code
  title="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code>, then, as soon as the
  element is <span title="insert an element into a document">inserted
  into the document</span>, the user agent must <span title="resolve a
  url">resolve</span> the value of that attribute relative to that
  element, and if that is successful, must run the <span
  title="concept-appcache-init">application cache selection
  algorithm</span> with the <var title="">document-is-markup</var>
  flag set to true, the resulting <span>absolute URL</span> as the
  manifest URL, and passing in the newly-created
  <code>Document</code>. Otherwise, if the attribute is absent or
  resolving it fails, then as soon as the root element is <span
  title="insert an element into a document">inserted into the

  title="concept-appcache-init">application cache selection
  algorithm</span> with the <var title="">document-is-markup</var>
  flag set to true, no manifest, and passing in the
  <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">Because the processing of the <code
  title="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code> attribute happens
  only once the root element is parsed, any URLs referenced by
  processing instructions before the root element (such as <code
  title="">&lt;?xml-styleesheet?></code> and <code
  title="">&lt;?xbl?></code> PIs) will be fetched from the network and
  cannot be cached.</p> <!-- XXX any ideas for avoiding this, that
  aren't a PI themselves? We can't delay the processing, since the
  whole point of the <?xbl?> PI is to have the XBL sheet loaded before
  the root element... -->

  <p>User agents may examine the namespace of the root
  <code>Element</code> node of this <code>Document</code> object to
  perform namespace-based dispatch to alternative processing tools,
  e.g. determining that the content is actually a syndication feed and
  passing it to a feed handler. If such processing is to take place,
  abort the steps in this section, and jump to <a
  href="#navigate-non-Document">the next step</a> (labeled
  "non-document content") in the <span>navigate</span> steps

  <p>Otherwise, then, with the newly created <code>Document</code>,
  the user agents must <span>update the session history with the new
  page</span>. User agents may do this before the complete document
  has been parsed (thus achieving <i>incremental rendering</i>).</p>

  <p>Error messages from the parse process (e.g. XML namespace
  well-formedness errors) may be reported inline by mutating the
  <code>Document</code>.</p>


  <h4 id="read-text"><dfn title="navigate-text">Page load processing model for text files</dfn></h4>

  <p>When a plain text document is to be loaded in a <span>browsing

  with the document, act as if the tokeniser had emitted a start tag
  token with the tag name "pre", set the <span>tokenization</span>
  stage's <span>content model flag</span> to <i>PLAINTEXT</i>, and
  begin to pass the stream of characters in the plain text document to
  that tokeniser.</p>

  <p>The rules for how to convert the bytes of the plain text document

  using the normal <code>Document</code> rendering rules, or mutate
  that <code>Document</code> until it represents the content the user

  <!-- next two paragraphs are similar to the navigate-text section,
  keep them in sync -->

  <p>Once the page has been set up, the user agent must act as if it
  had <span title="stop parsing">stopped parsing</span>.</p>

  <p>Upon creation of the <code>Document</code> object, the user agent
  must run the <span title="concept-appcache-init">application cache

  title="">document-is-markup</var> flag set to false, no manifest,
  passing in the newly-created <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>After creating the <code>Document</code> object, but potentially

  <h4 id="scroll-to-fragid"><dfn title="navigate-fragid">Navigating to a fragment identifier</dfn></h4>

  <p>When a user agent is supposed to navigate to a fragment
  identifier, then the user agent must <span>update the session
  history with the new page</span>, where "the new page" has the same
  <code>Document</code> as before but with the URL having the newly
  specified fragment identifier.</p>

  <p>Part of that algorithm involves the user agent having to
  <span>scroll to the fragment identifier</span>, which is the
  important part for this step.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is required to <dfn>scroll to the fragment
  identifier</dfn>, it must change the scrolling position of the
  document, or perform some other action, such that <span>the
  indicated part of the document</span> is brought to the user's
  attention. If there is no indicated part, then the user agent must
  not scroll anywhere.</p>

  <p><dfn>The indicated part of the document</dfn> is the one that
  the fragment identifier, if any, identifies. The semantics of the
  fragment identifier in terms of mapping it to a specific DOM Node is
  defined by the MIME type specification of the document's MIME Type
  (for example, the processing of fragment identifiers for XML MIME
  types is the responsibility of RFC3023).</p>

  <p>For HTML documents (and the <code>text/html</code> MIME type),
  the following processing model must be followed to determine what
  <span>the indicated part of the document</span> is.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p><span title="parse a url">Parse</span> the <span>URL</span>,
   and let <i>fragid</i> be the <span

   when navigating -->

   <li><p>If <i>fragid</i> is the empty string, then the indicated
   part of the document is the top of the document.</p></li>

   <li><p>If there is an element in the DOM that has an ID exactly
   equal to <i>fragid</i>, then the first such element in tree order
   is <span>the indicated part of the document</span>; stop the
   algorithm here.</p></li>

   <li><p>If there is an <code>a</code> element in the DOM that has a
   <code title="attr-a-name">name</code> attribute whose value is
   exactly equal to <i>fragid</i>, then the first such element in tree
   order is <span>the indicated part of the document</span>; stop the
   algorithm here.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, there is no indicated part of the
   document.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>For the purposes of the interaction of HTML with Selectors' <code
  title="selector-target">:target</code> pseudo-class, the
  <dfn><i>target element</i></dfn> is <span>the indicated part of the
  document</span>, if that is an element; otherwise there is no
  <i>target element</i>. <a href="#refsSELECTORS">[SELECTORS]</a></p>


  <h4>History traversal</h4>

  <p>When a user agent is required to <dfn>traverse the history</dfn>
  to a <i>specified entry</i>, the user agent must act as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If there is no longer a <code>Document</code> object for the
   entry in question, the user agent must <span>navigate</span> the
   browsing context to the location for that entry to perform an
   <span>entry update</span> of that entry, and abort these steps. The
   "<span>navigate</span>" algorithm reinvokes this "traverse"
   algorithm to complete the traversal, at which point there
   <em>is</em> a <code>Document</code> object and so this step gets
   skipped. The navigation must be done using the same <span>source
   browsing context</span> as was used the first time this entry was
   created.</p></li>

   <li><p>If appropriate, update the <span>current entry</span> in the
   <span>browsing context</span>'s <code>Document</code> object's
   <code>History</code> object to reflect any state that the user
   agent wishes to persist.</p>
   <p class="example">For example, some user agents might want to
   persist the scroll position, or the values of form controls.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>If the <i>specified entry</i> has a different
   <code>Document</code> object than the <span>current entry</span>
   then the user agent must run the following substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>If the browsing context is a <span>top-level browsing
     context</span> (and not an <span>auxiliary browsing
     context</span>), and the <span>origin</span> of the
     <code>Document</code> of the <i>specified entry</i> is not the
     <span title="same origin">same</span> as the <span>origin</span>
     of the <code>Document</code> of the <span>current entry</span>,
     then the following sub-sub-steps must be run:

      <ol>

       <li>The current <span>browsing context name</span> must be
       stored with all the entries in the history that are associated
       with <code>Document</code> objects with the <span>same

       that are contiguous with the <span>current entry</span>.</li>

       <li id="resetBCName">The browsing context's <span>browsing

      <ol>

       <li>The browsing context's <span>browsing context name</span>

       <li>Any <span>browsing context name</span> stored with the
       entries in the history that are associated with
       <code>Document</code> objects with the <span>same origin</span>

       contiguous with the specified entry, must be cleared.</li>

      </ol>

     </li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the <i>specified entry</i> is a state object or the

   context</span>'s <code>Window</code> object; and second, if the new
   URL has a fragment identifier, <span>scroll to the fragment
   identifier</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>User agents may also update other aspects of the document
   view when the location changes in this way, for instance the scroll
   position, values of form fields, etc.</p></li>

  <h4>Unloading documents</h4>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>unload a document</dfn>, it must run
  the following steps. These steps are passed an argument, <var

  whether the <code>Document</code> object is going to be

  <h3>Structured client-side storage</h3>

  <h4 id="storage">Storing name/value pairs</h4>

  <h5>Introduction</h5>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification introduces two related mechanisms, similar to
  HTTP session cookies, for storing structured data on the client
  side. <a href="#refsRFC2109">[RFC2109]</a> <a
  href="#refsRFC2965">[RFC2965]</a></p>

  <p>The first is designed for scenarios where the user is carrying
  out a single transaction, but could be carrying out multiple
  transactions in different windows at the same time.</p>

  <p>Cookies don't really handle this case well. For example, a user
  could be buying plane tickets in two different windows, using the
  same site. If the site used cookies to keep track of which ticket
  the user was buying, then as the user clicked from page to page in
  both windows, the ticket currently being purchased would "leak" from
  one window to the other, potentially causing the user to buy two
  tickets for the same flight without really noticing.</p>

  <p>To address this, this specification introduces the <code
  title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> DOM attribute.
  Sites can add data to the session storage, and it will be accessible
  to any page from the same site opened in that window.</p> <!-- we're
  not using xrefs here because this is just an intro -->

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, a page could have a checkbox that the user ticks to
   indicate that he wants insurance:</p>

   <pre>&lt;label>
 &lt;input type="checkbox" onchange="sessionStorage.insurance = checked">
 I want insurance on this trip.
&lt;/label></pre>

   <p>A later page could then check, from script, whether the user had
   checked the checkbox or not:</p>

   <pre>if (sessionStorage.insurance) { ... }</pre>

   <p>If the user had multiple windows opened on the site, each one
   would have its own individual copy of the session storage object.</p>

  </div>

  <!--

   sessionStorage.flightDeparture = 'OSL';
   sessionStorage.flightArrival = 'NYC';

   for (var i in forms[0].elements)
      sessionStorage["data_" + i.name] = i.value;

   if (!sessionStorage[documents])
     sessionStorage[documents] = {};
   sessionStorage[documents][filename] = <document/>;

  -->

  <p>The second storage mechanism is designed for storage that spans
  multiple windows, and lasts beyond the current session. In
  particular, Web applications may wish to store megabytes of user
  data, such as entire user-authored documents or a user's mailbox, on
  the client side for performance reasons.</p>

  <p>Again, cookies do not handle this case well, because they are
  transmitted with every request.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> DOM
  attribute is used to access a page's local storage area.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The site at example.com can display a count of how many times
   the user has loaded its page by putting the following at the bottom
   of its page:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>
  You have viewed this page
  &lt;span id="count">an untold number of&lt;/span>
  time(s).
&lt;/p>
&lt;script>
  if (!localStorage.pageLoadCount)
    localStorage.pageLoadCount = 0;
  localStorage.pageLoadCount = parseInt(localStorage.pageLoadCount, 10) + 1;
  document.getElementById('count').textContent = localStorage.pageLoadCount;
&lt;/script></pre>

   <p>The use of <code title="">parseInt()</code> is needed when
   dealing with numbers (integers in this case) because the storage
   APIs are all string-based.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Each site has its own separate storage area.</p>

  <p>Storage areas (both session storage and local storage) store
  strings. To store structured data in a storage area, you must first
  convert it to a string.</p>


  <h5>The <code>Storage</code> interface</h5>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>Storage</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-Storage-length">length</span>;
  [IndexGetter] DOMString <span title="dom-Storage-key">key</span>(in unsigned long index);
  [NameGetter] DOMString <span title="dom-Storage-getItem">getItem</span>(in DOMString key);
  [NameSetter] void <span title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem</span>(in DOMString key, in DOMString data);
  [NameDeleter] void <span title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem</span>(in DOMString key);
  void <span title="dom-Storage-clear">clear</span>();
};</pre>

  <!-- XXXv2 ideas:
    a getInfo() method that returns an object that tells you:
       - when the key was added
       - when the key was last modified
       - which page was the last to modify the key
    [-Mihai Sucan]

  -->  

  <p>Each <code>Storage</code> object provides access to a list of
  key/value pairs, which are sometimes called items. Keys and values
  are strings. Any string (including the empty string) is a valid
  key.</p>

  <p class="note">To store more structured data, authors may consider
  using the <a href="#sql">SQL interfaces</a> instead.</p>

  <p>Each <code>Storage</code> object is associated with a list of
  key/value pairs when it is created, as defined in the sections on
  the <code title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> and <code
  title="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attributes. Multiple
  separate objects implementing the <code>Storage</code> interface can
  all be associated with the same list of key/value pairs
  simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The object's <span>indices of the supported indexed
  properties</span> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than
  the number of key/value pairs currently present in the list
  associated with the object. If the list is empty, then there are no
  <span>supported indexed properties</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of key/value pairs currently
  present in the list associated with the object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-key"><code>key(<var
  title="">n</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the name of the
  <var title="">n</var>th key in the list. The order of keys is
  user-agent defined, but must be consistent within an object between
  changes to the number of keys. (Thus, <span
  title="dom-Storage-setItem">adding</span> or <span
  title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removing</span> a key may change the
  order of the keys, but merely changing the value of an existing key
  must not.) <!--The order of keys may differ between instances of the
  <code>Storage</code> interface accessing the same list. [removed for
  now for clarity, but if people ask, put it back. this is part of the
  spec.]--> If <var title="">n</var> is <!--less than zero or [can't,
  unsigned]--> greater than or equal to the number of key/value pairs
  in the object, then this method must raise an
  <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <p>The <span>names of the supported named properties</span> on a
  <code>Storage</code> object are the keys of each key/value pair
  currently present in the list associated with the object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-getItem"><code>getItem(<var
  title="">key</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the current
  value associated with the given <var title="">key</var>. If the
  given <var title="">key</var> does not exist in the list associated
  with the object then this method must return null.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-setItem"><code>setItem(<var
  title="">key</var>, <var title="">value</var>)</code></dfn> method
  must first check if a key/value pair with the given <var
  title="">key</var> already exists in the list associated with the
  object.</p>

  <p>If it does not, then a new key/value pair must be added to the
  list, with the given <var title="">key</var> and <var
  title="">value</var>.</p>

  <p>If the given <var title="">key</var> <em>does</em> exist in the
  list, then it must have its value updated to the value given in the
  <var title="">value</var> argument.</p>

  <p>If it couldn't set the new value, the method must raise an
  <code>QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR</code> exception. (Setting could fail if,
  e.g., the user has disabled storage for the domain, or if the quota
  has been exceeded.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-removeItem"><code>removeItem(<var
  title="">key</var>)</code></dfn> method must cause the key/value
  pair with the given <var title="">key</var> to be removed from the
  list associated with the object, if it exists. If no item with that
  key exists, the method must do nothing.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> and <code
  title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code> methods must be
  atomic with respect to failure. In the case of failure, the method
  does nothing. That is, changes to the data storage area must either
  be successful, or the data storage area must not be changed at
  all.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-Storage-clear"><code>clear()</code></dfn>
  method must atomically cause the list associated with the object to
  be emptied of all key/value pairs, if there are any. If there are
  none, then the method must do nothing.</p>

  <p class="note">When the <code
  title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code>, <code
  title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code>, and <code
  title="dom-Storage-clear">clear()</code> methods are invoked, events
  are fired on other <code>HTMLDocument</code> objects that can access
  the newly stored or removed data, as defined in the sections on the
  <code title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> and <code
  title="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attributes.</p> <!--
  not normative, see the sections below for the normative statement
  -->

  <p class="note">This specification does not require that the above
  methods wait until the data has been physically written to
  disk. Only consistency in what different scripts accessing the same
  underlying list of key/value pairs see is required.</p>



  <h5>The <code title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> attribute</h5>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-sessionStorage"><code>sessionStorage</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the set of storage areas specific to the
  current <span>top-level browsing context</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>top-level browsing context</span> has a unique set of
  session storage areas, one for each <span>origin</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents should not expire data from a browsing context's
  session storage areas, but may do so when the user requests that
  such data be deleted, or when the UA detects that it has limited
  storage space, or for security reasons. User agents should always
  avoid deleting data while a script that could access that data is
  running. When a top-level browsing context is destroyed (and
  therefore permanently inaccessible to the user) the data stored in
  its session storage areas can be discarded with it, as the API
  described in this specification provides no way for that data to
  ever be subsequently retrieved.</p>

  <p class="note">The lifetime of a browsing context can be unrelated
  to the lifetime of the actual user agent process itself, as the user
  agent may support resuming sessions after a restart.</p>

  <p>When a new <code>HTMLDocument</code> is created, the user agent
  must check to see if the document's <span>top-level browsing
  context</span> has allocated a session storage area for that
  document's <span>origin</span>. If it has not, a new storage area
  for that document's <span>origin</span> must be created.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code>
  attribute must return the <code>Storage</code> object associated
  with that session storage area. Each <code>Document</code> object
  must have a separate object for its <code>Window</code>'s <code
  title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>When a new <span>top-level browsing context</span> is created by
  cloning an existing <span>browsing context</span>, the new browsing
  context must start with the same session storage areas as the
  original, but the two sets must from that point on be considered
  separate, not affecting each other in any way.</p>

  <p>When a new <span>top-level browsing context</span> is created by
  a <span title="concept-script">script</span> in an existing
  <span>browsing context</span>, or by the user following a link in an
  existing browsing context, or in some other way related to a
  specific <code>HTMLDocument</code>, then the session storage area of
  the <span>origin</span> of that <code>HTMLDocument</code> must be
  copied into the new browsing context when it is created.  From that
  point on, however, the two session storage areas must be considered
  separate, not affecting each other in any way.</p>

  <p id="sessionStorageEvent">When the <code
  title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code>, <code
  title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code>, and <code
  title="dom-Storage-clear">clear()</code> methods are called on a
  <code>Storage</code> object <var title="">x</var> that is associated
  with a session storage area, if the methods did something, then in
  every <code>HTMLDocument</code> object whose <code>Window</code>
  object's <code title="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code>
  attribute's <code>Storage</code> object is associated with the same
  storage area, other than <var title="">x</var>, a <code
  title="event-storage">storage</code> event must be fired, as <span
  title="event-storage">described below</span>.</p>


  <h5>The <code title="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attribute</h5>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-localStorage"><code>localStorage</code></dfn>
  object provides a <code>Storage</code> object for an
  <span>origin</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents must have a set of local storage areas, one for each
  <span>origin</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents should expire data from the local storage areas only
  for security reasons or when requested to do so by the user. User
  agents should always avoid deleting data while a script that could
  access that data is running. Data stored in local storage areas
  should be considered potentially user-critical. It is expected that
  Web applications will use the local storage areas for storing
  user-written documents.</p>

  <p>When the <code title="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code>
  attribute is accessed, the user agent must check to see if it has
  allocated a local storage area for the <span>origin</span> of the
  <code>Document</code> of the <code>Window</code> object on which the
  method was invoked. If it has not, a new storage area for that
  <span>origin</span> must be created.</p>

  <p>The user agent must then return the <code>Storage</code> object
  associated with that origin's local storage area. Each
  <code>Document</code> object must have a separate object for its
  <code>Window</code>'s <code
  title="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attribute.</p>

  <p id="localStorageEvent">When the <code
  title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code>, <code
  title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code>, and <code
  title="dom-Storage-clear">clear()</code> methods are called on a
  <code>Storage</code> object <var title="">x</var> that is associated
  with a local storage area, if the methods did something, then in
  every <code>HTMLDocument</code> object whose <code>Window</code>
  object's <code title="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code>
  attribute's <code>Storage</code> object is associated with the same
  storage area, other than <var title="">x</var>, a <code
  title="event-storage">storage</code> event must be fired, as <span
  title="event-storage">described below</span>.</p>


  <h5>The <code title="event-storage">storage</code> event</h5>

  <!-- XXX fix up for workers: target is wrong, source and storageArea
  definitions are wrong -->

  <p>The <dfn title="event-storage"><code>storage</code></dfn> event
  is fired when a storage area changes, as described in the previous
  two sections (<a href="#sessionStorageEvent">for session
  storage</a>, <a href="#localStorageEvent">for local
  storage</a>).</p>

  <p>When this happens, the user agent must dispatch an event with the
  name <code>storage</code>, with no namespace, which does not bubble
  but is cancelable, and which uses the <code>StorageEvent</code>
  interface, at each <code>Window</code> object whose
  <code>Document</code> object both has a <code>Storage</code> object
  that is affected, and is <span>fully active</span>.</p>

  <p>If the event is being fired due to an invocation of the
  <code title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> or <code
  title="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code> methods, the
  event must have its <code title="dom-StorageEvent-key">key</code>
  attribute set to the name of the key in question, its <code
  title="dom-StorageEvent-oldValue">oldValue</code> attribute set to
  the old value of the key in question, or null if the key is newly
  added, and its <code title="dom-StorageEvent-newValue">newValue</code>
  attribute set to the new value of the key in question, or null if
  the key was removed.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the event is being fired due to an invocation of
  the <code title="dom-Storage-clear">clear()</code> method, the event
  must have its <code title="dom-StorageEvent-key">key</code>, <code
  title="dom-StorageEvent-oldValue">oldValue</code>, and <code
  title="dom-StorageEvent-newValue">newValue</code> attributes set to
  null.</p>

  <p>In addition, the event must have its <code
  title="dom-StorageEvent-url">url</code> attribute set to <span
  title="the document's address">the address of the document</span>
  whose <code>Storage</code> object was affected; its <code
  title="dom-StorageEvent-source">source</code> attribute set to the
  that document's <span>browsing context</span>'s
  <code>WindowProxy</code> object, if the two documents are in the
  same <span>unit of related browsing contexts</span>, or null
  otherwise; and its <code
  title="dom-StorageEvent-storageArea">storageArea</code> attribute
  set to the <code>Storage</code> object from the <code>Window</code>
  object of the target <code>Document</code> that represents the same
  kind of <code>Storage</code> area as was affected (i.e. session or
  local).</p>

  <h5>Threads</h5>

  <p>Multiple browsing contexts must be able to access the local
  storage areas simultaneously in such a manner that scripts cannot
  detect any concurrent script execution.</p>

  <p>This is required to guarantee that the <code
  title="dom-Storage-length">length</code> attribute of a
  <code>Storage</code> object never changes while a script is
  executing, other than in a way that is predictable by the script
  itself.</p>

  <p class="note">There are various ways of implementing this
  requirement. One is to just have one <span>event loop</span> for all
  <span title="browsing context">browsing contexts</span>. Another is
  that if a script running in one browsing context accesses a storage
  area, the user agent blocks scripts in other browsing contexts when
  they try to access the same storage area until the <span>event
  loop</span> running the first script has completed running the task
  that started that script. Another (potentially more efficient but
  certainly more complex) implementation strategy is to use optimistic
  transactional script execution. This specification does not require
  any particular implementation strategy, so long as the requirement
  above is met.</p>




  <h4 id="sql">Database storage</h4>

  <!-- Feature requests for future versions (v2):
        * deleting databases
        * determining how much storage room is left
        * handling the database getting corrupted
  -->

  <h5>Introduction</h5>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p class="XXX">...</p>

<!-- include an example that does something like the following to show
you should never embed strings straight into the statement, even when you
have a variable and unknowable number of literals coming:
   var q = "";
   for each (var i in array)
     q += (q == "" ? "" : ", ") + "?";
   executeSql('SELECT rowid FROM t WHERE c IN (' + q + ')', array, ...);
-->

  <h5>Databases</h5>

  <p>Each <i>origin</i> has an associated set of databases. Each
  database has a name and a current version. There is no way to
  enumerate or delete the databases available for a domain from this
  API.</p>

  <p class="note">Each database has one version at a time; a database
  can't exist in multiple versions at once. Versions are intended to
  allow authors to manage schema changes incrementally and
  non-destructively, and without running the risk of old code (e.g. in
  another browser window) trying to write to a database with incorrect
  assumptions.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-opendatabase"><code>openDatabase()</code></dfn> method
  returns a <code>Database</code> object. The method takes four
  arguments: a database name, a database version, a display name, and
  an estimated size, in bytes, of the data that will be stored in the
  database.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-opendatabase">openDatabase()</code> method
  must use and create databases from the <span>origin</span> of the
  <code>Document</code> of the <code>Window</code> object on which the
  method was invoked.</p>

  <p>If the database version provided is not the empty string, and the
  database already exists but has a different version, or no version,
  then the method must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the database version provided is the empty string,
  or if the database doesn't yet exist, or if the database exists and
  the version provided to the <code
  title="dom-opendatabase">openDatabase()</code> method is the same as
  the current version associated with the database, then the method
  must return a <code>Database</code> object representing the database
  that has the name that was given. If no such database exists, it
  must be created first.</p>

  <p>All strings including the empty string are valid database
  names. Database names must be compared in a
  <span>case-sensitive</span> manner.</p>

  <p>The user agent may raise a <code>SECURITY_ERR</code> exception
  instead of returning a <code>Database</code> object if the request
  violates a policy decision (e.g. if the user agent is configured to
  not allow the page to open databases).</p>

  <p class="note">Implementations can support this even in
  environments that only support a subset of all strings as database
  names by mapping database names (e.g. using a hashing algorithm) to
  the supported set of names.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to use the display name and the
  estimated database size to optimize the user experience. For
  example, a user agent could use the estimated size to suggest an
  initial quota to the user. This allows a site that is aware that it
  will try to use hundreds of megabytes to declare this upfront,
  instead of the user agent prompting the user for permission to
  increase the quota every five megabytes.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-database-transaction"><code>transaction()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn
  title="dom-database-readTransaction"><code>readTransaction()</code></dfn>
  methods takes one to three arguments. When called, these method must
  immediately return and then asynchronously run the <span>transaction
  steps</span> with the <i>transaction callback</i> being the first
  argument, the <i>error callback</i> being the second argument, if
  any, the <i>success callback</i> being the third argument, if any,
  and with no <i>preflight operation</i> or <i>postflight
  operation</i>.</p>

  <p>For the <code
  title="dom-database-transaction">transaction()</code> method, the
  <i>mode</i> must be read/write. For the <code
  title="dom-database-readTransaction">readTransaction()</code>
  method, the <i>mode</i> must be read-only.</p>

  <p>The version that the database was opened with is the <dfn
  title="concept-database-expected-version">expected version</dfn> of
  this <code>Database</code> object. It can be the empty string, in
  which case there is no expected version &mdash; any version is
  fine.</p>

  <p>On getting, the <dfn
  title="dom-database-version"><code>version</code></dfn> attribute
  must return the current version of the database (as opposed to the
  <span title="concept-database-expected-version">expected
  version</span> of the <code>Database</code> object).</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-database-changeVersion"><code>changeVersion()</code></dfn>
  method allows scripts to atomically verify the version number and
  change it at the same time as doing a schema update. When the method
  is invoked, it must immediately return, and then asynchronously run
  the <span>transaction steps</span> with the <i>transaction
  callback</i> being the third argument, the <i>error callback</i>
  being the fourth argument, the <i>success callback</i> being the
  fifth argument, the <i>preflight operation</i> being the
  following:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Check that the value of the first argument to the <code
   title="dom-database-changeVersion">changeVersion()</code> method
   exactly matches the database's actual version. If it does not, then
   the <i>preflight operation</i> fails.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>...the <i>postflight operation</i> being the following:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Change the database's actual version to the value of the second
   argument to the <code
   title="dom-database-changeVersion">changeVersion()</code>
   method.</li>

   <li>Change the <code>Database</code> object's expected version to
   the value of the second argument to the <code
   title="dom-database-changeVersion">changeVersion()</code>
   method.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>...and the <i>mode</i> being read/write.</p>


  <h5>Executing SQL statements</h5>

  <p>The <code title="dom-database-transaction">transaction()</code>
  and <code title="dom-database-changeVersion">changeVersion()</code>
  methods invoke callbacks with <code>SQLTransaction</code>
  objects.</p>

  <pre class="idl">typedef sequence&lt;any> <dfn>ObjectArray</dfn>;

interface <dfn>SQLTransaction</dfn> {
  void <span title="dom-sqltransaction-executeSql">executeSql</span>(in DOMString sqlStatement, [Optional] in <span>ObjectArray</span> arguments, [Optional] in <span>SQLStatementCallback</span> callback, [Optional] in <span>SQLStatementErrorCallback</span> errorCallback);
};

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject]
interface <dfn>SQLStatementCallback</dfn> {
  void <span title="dom-sqlstatementcallback-handleEvent">handleEvent</span>(in <span>SQLTransaction</span> transaction, in <span>SQLResultSet</span> resultSet);
};

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject]
interface <dfn>SQLStatementErrorCallback</dfn> {
  boolean <span title="dom-sqlstatementerrorcallback-handleEvent">handleEvent</span>(in <span>SQLTransaction</span> transaction, in <span>SQLError</span> error);
};</pre>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-sqltransaction-executeSql"><code>executeSql(<var
  title="">sqlStatement</var>, <var title="">arguments</var>, <var
  title="">callback</var>, <var
  title="">errorCallback</var>)</code></dfn> method is invoked, the
  user agent must run the following algorithm. (This algorithm is
  relatively simple in that it doesn't actually execute any SQL
  &mdash; the bulk of the work is actually done as part of the
  <span>transaction steps</span>.)</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the method was not invoked during the execution of a
   <code>SQLTransactionCallback</code>,
   <code>SQLStatementCallback</code>, or
   <code>SQLStatementErrorCallback</code> then raise an
   <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception. (Calls from inside a
   <code>SQLTransactionErrorCallback</code> thus raise an
   exception. The <code>SQLTransactionErrorCallback</code> handler is
   only called once a transaction has failed, and no SQL statements
   can be added to a failed transaction.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Parse the first argument to the method (<var
   title="">sqlStatement</var>) as a SQL statement, with the exception
   that U+003F QUESTION MARK (?) characters can be used in place of
   SQL literals in the statement. <a
   href="#refsSQL">[SQL]</a></p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Replace each <code title="">?</code> placeholder with the value
    of the argument in the <var title="">arguments</var> array with
    the same position. (So the first <code title="">?</code>
    placeholder gets replaced by the first value in the <var
    title="">arguments</var> array, and generally the <var
    title="">n</var>th <code title="">?</code> placeholder gets
    replaced by the <var title="">n</var>th value in the <var
    title="">arguments</var> array.)</p>

    <p class="note">Substitutions for <code title="">?</code>
    placeholders are done at the literal level, not as string
    concatenations, so this provides a way to dynamically insert
    parameters into a statement without risk of a SQL injection
    attack.</p>

    <p>If the second argument is omitted or null, then treat the <var
    title="">arguments</var> array as empty.</p>

    <p>The result is <i>the statement</i>.</p>

    <p class="XXX">Implementation feedback is requested on what
    to do with arguments that are of types that are not supported by
    the underlying SQL backend. For example, SQLite doesn't support
    booleans, so what should the UA do if passed a boolean? The Gears
    team suggests failing, not silently converting types.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the syntax of <var title="">sqlStatement</var> is not
   valid (except for the use of <code title="">?</code> characters in
   the place of literals), or the statement uses features that are not
   supported (e.g. due to security reasons), or the number of items in
   the <var title="">arguments</var> array is not equal to the number
   of <code title="">?</code> placeholders in the statement, or the
   statement cannot be parsed for some other reason, then mark <i>the
   statement</i> as bogus.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <code>Database</code> object that the
   <code>SQLTransaction</code> object was created from has an <span
   title="concept-database-expected-version">expected version</span>
   that is neither the empty string nor the actual version of the
   database, then mark <i>the statement</i> as bogus. (<span
   title="dom-sqlerror-code-2">Error code 2</span>.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Queue up <i>the statement</i> in the transaction, along with
   the third argument (if any) as the statement's result set callback
   and the fourth argument (if any) as the error callback.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The user agent must act as if the database was hosted in an
  otherwise completely empty environment with no resources. For
  example, attempts to read from or write to the file system will
  fail.</p>


  <p>SQL inherently supports multiple concurrent connections. Authors
  should make appropriate use of the transaction features to handle
  the case of multiple scripts interacting with the same database
  simultaneously (as could happen if the same page was opened in two
  different <span title="browsing context">browsing
  contexts</span>).</p>

  <p>User agents must consider statements that use the <code
  title="">BEGIN</code>, <code title="">COMMIT</code>, and <code
  title="">ROLLBACK</code> SQL features as being unsupported (and thus
  will mark them as bogus), so as to not let these statements
  interfere with the explicit transactions managed by the database API
  itself.</p>

  <p class="note">A future version of this specification will probably
  define the exact SQL subset required in more detail.</p>


  <h5>Database query results</h5>

  <p>The <code title="dom-transaction-executeSql">executeSql()</code>
  method invokes its callback with a <code>SQLResultSet</code> object
  as an argument.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>SQLResultSet</dfn> {
  readonly attribute long <span title="dom-SQLResultSet-insertId">insertId</span>;
  readonly attribute long <span title="dom-SQLResultSet-rowsAffected">rowsAffected</span>;
  readonly attribute <span>SQLResultSetRowList</span> <span title="dom-SQLResultSet-rows">rows</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-SQLResultSet-insertId"><code>insertId</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the row ID of the row that the
  <code>SQLResultSet</code> object's SQL statement inserted into the
  database, if the statement inserted a row. If the statement inserted
  multiple rows, the ID of the last row must be the one returned. If
  the statement did not insert a row, then the attribute must instead
  raise an <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-SQLResultSet-rowsAffected"><code>rowsAffected</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of rows that were affected by the
  SQL statement. If the statement did not affected any rows, then the
  attribute must return zero. For "SELECT" statements, this returns
  zero (querying the database doesn't affect any rows).</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-SQLResultSet-rows"><code>rows</code></dfn>
  attribute must return a <code>SQLResultSetRowList</code>
  representing the rows returned, in the order returned by the
  database. If no rows were returned, then the object will be empty
  (its <code title="dom-SQLResultSetRowList-length">length</code> will
  be zero).</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>SQLResultSetRowList</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-SQLResultSetRowList-length">length</span>;
  [IndexGetter] <span>any</span> <span title="dom-SQLResultSetRowList-item">item</span>(in unsigned long index);
};</pre>

  <p><code>SQLResultSetRowList</code> objects have a <dfn
  title="dom-SQLResultSetRowList-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute that must return the number of rows it represents (the
  number of rows returned by the database). This is the <var
  title="dom-SQLResultSetRowList-length">length</var>.</p>

  <p>The object's <span>indices of the supported indexed
  properties</span> are the numbers in the range zero to <span><var
  title="dom-SQLResultSetRowList-length">length</var>-1</span>, unless
  the <var title="dom-SQLResultSetRowList-length">length</var> is
  zero, in which case there are no <span>supported indexed
  properties</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-SQLResultSetRowList-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> attribute must return the row
  with the given index <var title="">index</var>. If there is no such
  row, then the method must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>

  <p>Each row must be represented by a native ordered dictionary data
  type. In the ECMAScript binding, this must be <code>Object</code>.
  Each row object must have one property (or dictionary entry) per
  column, with those properties enumerating in the order that these
  columns were returned by the database. Each property must have the
  name of the column and the value of the cell, as they were returned
  by the database.</p>


  <h5>Errors</h5>

  <p>Errors in the database API are reported using callbacks that have
  a <code>SQLError</code> object as one of their arguments.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>SQLError</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-SQLError-code">code</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-SQLError-message">message</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-SQLError-code"><code>code</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must return the most appropriate code from the following
  table:</p>

  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th>Code
     <th>Situation
   <tbody>

    <tr>
     <td><dfn title="dom-sqlerror-code-0">0</dfn>
     <td>The transaction failed for reasons unrelated to the database
     itself and not covered by any other error code.

    <tr>
     <td><dfn title="dom-sqlerror-code-1">1</dfn>
     <td>The statement failed for database reasons not covered by any
     other error code.

    <tr>
     <td><dfn title="dom-sqlerror-code-2">2</dfn>
     <td>The statement failed because the <span
     title="concept-database-expected-version">expected version</span>
     of the database didn't match the actual database version.

    <tr>
     <td><dfn title="dom-sqlerror-code-3">3</dfn>
     <td>The statement failed because the data returned from the
     database was too large. The SQL "LIMIT" modifier might be useful
     to reduce the size of the result set.

    <tr>
     <td><dfn title="dom-sqlerror-code-4">4</dfn>
     <td>The statement failed because there was not enough remaining
     storage space, or the storage quota was reached and the user
     declined to give more space to the database.

    <tr>
     <td><dfn title="dom-sqlerror-code-5">5</dfn>
     <td>The statement failed because the transaction's first
     statement was a read-only statement, and a subsequent statement
     in the same transaction tried to modify the database, but the
     transaction failed to obtain a write lock before another
     transaction obtained a write lock and changed a part of the
     database that the former transaction was depending upon.

    <tr>
     <td><dfn title="dom-sqlerror-code-6">6</dfn>
     <td>An <code title="">INSERT</code>, <code
     title="">UPDATE</code>, or <code title="">REPLACE</code>
     statement failed due to a constraint failure. For example,
     because a row was being inserted and the value given for the
     primary key column duplicated the value of an existing row.

  </table>

  <p class="XXX">We should define a more thorough list of
  codes. Implementation feedback is requested to determine what codes
  are needed.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-SQLError-message"><code>message</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute must return an error message describing the error
  encountered. The message should be localized to the user's
  language.</p>



  <h5>Processing model</h5>

  <p>The <dfn>transaction steps</dfn> are as follows. These steps must
  be run asynchronously. These steps are invoked with a <i>transaction
  callback</i>, optionally an <i>error callback</i>, optionally a
  <i>success callback</i>, optionally a <i>preflight operation</i>,
  optionally a <i>postflight operation</i>, and with a <i>mode</i>
  that is either read/write or read-only.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Open a new SQL transaction to the database, and create a
   <code>SQLTransaction</code> object that represents that
   transaction. If the <i>mode</i> is read/write, the transaction must
   have an exclusive write lock over the entire database. If the
   <i>mode</i> is read-only, the transaction must have a shared read
   lock over the entire database. The user agent should wait for an
   appropriate lock to be available.</p></li>

   <li><p>If an error occurred in the opening of the transaction
   (e.g. if the user agent failed to obtain an appropriate lock after
   an appropriate delay), jump to the last step.</p></li>

   <li><p>If a <i>preflight operation</i> was defined for this
   instance of the transaction steps, run that. If it fails, then jump
   to the last step. (This is basically a hook for the <code
   title="dom-database-changeVersion">changeVersion()</code>
   method.)</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Queue a task</span> to invoke the <i>transaction
   callback</i> with the aforementioned <code>SQLTransaction</code>
   object as its only argument, and wait for that task to be
   run.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the callback couldn't be called (e.g. it was null), or if
   the callback was invoked and raised an exception, jump to the last
   step.</p></li>
<!--
   <li><p>If the callback could be called and returned false, let
   <i>callback-canceled</i> be true. Otherwise, let it be
   false.</p></li>
-->
   <li><p>While there are any statements queued up in the transaction,
   perform the following steps for each queued up statement in the
   transaction, oldest first. Each statement has a statement,
   optionally a result set callback, and optionally an error
   callback.</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the statement is marked as bogus, jump to the "in case
     of error" steps below.</p></li>

     <li id="modifications-fail-if-read-only">

      <p>If the <i>mode</i> is read-only but the statement's main verb
      can modify the database, jump to the "in case of error" steps
      below.</p>

      <p class="note">Only the statement's main verb (e.g. <code
      title="">UPDATE</code>, <code title="">SELECT</code>, <code
      title="">DROP</code>) is considered here. Thus, a statement like
      "<code title="">UPDATE test SET id=0 WHERE 0=1</code>" would be
      treated as potentially modifying the database for the purposes
      of this step, even though it could never in fact have any
      side-effects.</p>

     </li>

     <li><p>Execute the statement in the context of the transaction.
     <a href="#refsSQL">[SQL]</a></p>

     <li><p>If the statement failed, jump to the "in case of error"

     <li><p>Create a <code>SQLResultSet</code> object that represents

     <li><p>If the statement has a result set callback, <span>queue a
     task</span> to invoke it with the <code>SQLTransaction</code>

    </ol>

    <p>In case of error (or more specifically, if the above substeps
    say to jump to the "in case of error" steps), run the following
    substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the statement had an associated error callback, then

     <li><p>If the error callback returns false, then move on to the

     steps.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>If a <i>postflight operation</i> was defined for this

   jump to the last step.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Queue a task</span> to invoke the <i>success
   callback</i>.</p></li>

   <li><p>End these steps. The next step is only used when something

   <li><p><span>Queue a task</span> to invoke the <i>error

   in the transaction are discarded.</p></li>

  </ol>



  <h4>Disk space</h4>

  <p>User agents should limit the total amount of space allowed for
  storage areas and databases.</p>

  <p>User agents should guard against sites storing data in the
  storage areas or databases of subdomains, e.g. storing up to the
  limit in a1.example.com, a2.example.com, a3.example.com, etc,
  circumventing the main example.com storage limit.</p>

  <p>User agents may prompt the user when quotas are reached, allowing
  the user to grant a site more space. This enables sites to store
  many user-created documents on the user's computer, for
  instance.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow users to see how much space each domain
  is using.</p>

  <!--<p>If the storage area space limit is reached during a <code
  title="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> call, the method will
  raise an exception.</p>-->

  <p>A mostly arbitrary limit of five megabytes per domain is
  recommended. Implementation feedback is welcome and will be used to
  update this suggestion in future.</p>


  <h4>Privacy</h4>

  <h5>User tracking</h5>

  <p>A third-party advertiser (or any entity capable of getting
  content distributed to multiple sites) could use a unique identifier
  stored in its local storage area or in its client-side database to
  track a user across multiple sessions, building a profile of the
  user's interests to allow for highly targeted advertising. In
  conjunction with a site that is aware of the user's real identity
  (for example an e-commerce site that requires authenticated
  credentials), this could allow oppressive groups to target
  individuals with greater accuracy than in a world with purely
  anonymous Web usage.</p>

  <p>There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate the
  risk of user tracking:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>

    <p>Blocking third-party storage: user agents may restrict access
    to the <code title="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> and
    database objects to scripts originating at the domain of the
    top-level document of the <span>browsing context</span>, for
    instance denying access to the API for pages from other domains
    running in <code>iframe</code>s.</p>

   </li>
 
   <li>

    <p>Expiring stored data: user agents may automatically delete
    stored data after a period of time.</p>

    <p>For example, a user agent could treat third-party local
    storage areas as session-only storage, deleting the data once the
    user had closed all the <span>browsing contexts</span> that could
    access it.</p>

    <p>This can restrict the ability of a site to track a user, as the
    site would then only be able to track the user across multiple
    sessions when he authenticates with the site itself (e.g. by
    making a purchase or logging in to a service).</p>

    <p>However, this also puts the user's data at risk.</p>

    <!-- XXX should there be an explicit way for sites to state when
    data should expire? as in
    localStorage.expireData(365); ? -->

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Treating persistent storage as cookies: user agents should
    present the persistent storage and database features to the user
    in a way that does not distinguish them from HTTP session
    cookies. <a href="#refsRFC2109">[RFC2109]</a> <a
    href="#refsRFC2965">[RFC2965]</a></p>

    <p>This might encourage users to view persistent storage with
    healthy suspicion.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Site-specific white-listing of access to local storage areas
    and databases: user agents may allow sites to access session
    storage areas in an unrestricted manner, but require the user to
    authorize access to local storage areas and databases.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Origin</span>-tracking of persistent storage data: user
    agents may record the origins of sites that contained content from
    third-party origins that caused data to be stored.</p>

    <p>If this information is then used to present the view of data
    currently in persistent storage, it would allow the user to make
    informed decisions about which parts of the persistent storage to
    prune. Combined with a blacklist ("delete this data and prevent
    this domain from ever storing data again"), the user can restrict
    the use of persistent storage to sites that he trusts.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Shared blacklists: user agents may allow users to share their
    persistent storage domain blacklists.</p>

    <p>This would allow communities to act together to protect their
    privacy.</p>

   </li>

  </ul>

  <p>While these suggestions prevent trivial use of these APIs for
  user tracking, they do not block it altogether. Within a single
  domain, a site can continue to track the user during a session, and
  can then pass all this information to the third party along with any
  identifying information (names, credit card numbers, addresses)
  obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with multiple
  sites to obtain such information, a profile can still be
  created.</p>

  <p>However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no
  cooperation from the user agent whatsoever, for instance by using
  session identifiers in URLs, a technique already commonly used for
  innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even
  retroactively). This information can then be shared with other
  sites, using using visitors' IP addresses and other user-specific
  data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine
  separate sessions into coherent user profiles.</p>


  <h5>Cookie resurrection</h5>

  <p>If the user interface for persistent storage presents data in the
  persistent storage features separately from data in HTTP session
  cookies, then users are likely to delete data in one and not the
  other. This would allow sites to use the two features as redundant
  backup for each other, defeating a user's attempts to protect his
  privacy.</p>


  <h4>Security</h4>

  <h5>DNS spoofing attacks</h5>

  <p>Because of the potential for DNS spoofing attacks, one cannot
  guarantee that a host claiming to be in a certain domain really is
  from that domain. To mitigate this, pages can use SSL. Pages using
  SSL can be sure that only pages using SSL that have certificates
  identifying them as being from the same domain can access their
  local storage areas and databases.</p>


  <h5>Cross-directory attacks</h5>

  <p>Different authors sharing one host name, for example users
  hosting content on <code>geocities.com</code>, all share one
  persistent storage object and one set of databases. There is no
  feature to restrict the access by pathname. Authors on shared hosts
  are therefore recommended to avoid using the persistent storage
  features, as it would be trivial for other authors to read from and
  write to the same storage area or database.</p>

  <p class="note">Even if a path-restriction feature was made
  available, the usual DOM scripting security model would make it
  trivial to bypass this protection and access the data from any
  path.</p>


  <h5>Implementation risks</h5>

  <p>The two primary risks when implementing these persistent storage
  features are letting hostile sites read information from other
  domains, and letting hostile sites write information that is then
  read from other domains.</p>

  <p>Letting third-party sites read data that is not supposed to be
  read from their domain causes <em>information leakage</em>, For
  example, a user's shopping wishlist on one domain could be used by
  another domain for targeted advertising; or a user's
  work-in-progress confidential documents stored by a word-processing
  site could be examined by the site of a competing company.</p>

  <p>Letting third-party sites write data to the storage areas of
  other domains can result in <em>information spoofing</em>, which is
  equally dangerous. For example, a hostile site could add items to a
  user's wishlist; or a hostile site could set a user's session
  identifier to a known ID that the hostile site can then use to track
  the user's actions on the victim site.</p>

  <p>Thus, strictly following the <span>origin</span> model described
  in this specification is important for user security.</p>


  <h5>SQL and user agents</h5>

  <p>User agent implementors are strongly encouraged to audit all
  their supported SQL statements for security implications. For
  example, <code title="">LOAD DATA INFILE</code> is likely to pose
  security risks and there is little reason to support it.</p>

  <p>In general, it is recommended that user agents not support
  features that control how databases are stored on disk. For example,
  there is little reason to allow Web authors to control the character
  encoding used in the disk representation of the data, as all data in
  ECMAScript is implicitly UTF-16.</p>


  <h5>SQL injection</h5>

  <p>Authors are strongly recommended to make use of the <code
  title="">?</code> placeholder feature of the <code
  title="dom-sqltransaction-executeSql">executeSql()</code> method,
  and to never construct SQL statements on the fly.</p>





  <h3 id="links">Links</h3>


  <h4>Hyperlink elements</h4>

  <p>The <code>a</code>, <code>area</code>, and <code>link</code>
  elements can, in certain situations described in the definitions of
  those elements, represent <dfn
  title="hyperlink">hyperlinks</dfn>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-hyperlink-href"><code>href</code></dfn>
  attribute on a hyperlink element must have a value that is a
  <span>valid URL</span>. This URL is the <em>destination
  resource</em> of the hyperlink.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p>The <code title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute on
   <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements is not required; when
   those elements do not have <code
   title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attributes they do not
   represent hyperlinks.</p>

   <p>The <code title="attr-link-href">href</code> attribute on the
   <code>link</code> element <em>is</em> required, but whether a
   <code>link</code> element represents a hyperlink or not depends on
   the value of the <code title="attr-link-rel">rel</code> attribute
   of that element.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-hyperlink-target"><code>target</code></dfn>
  attribute, if present, must be a <span>valid browsing context name
  or keyword</span>. User agents use this name when <span>following
  hyperlinks</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn id="ping"
  title="attr-hyperlink-ping"><code>ping</code></dfn> attribute, if
  present, gives the URLs of the resources that are interested in
  being notified if the user follows the hyperlink. The value must be
  a space separated list of one or more <span>valid URLs</span>. The
  value is used by the user agent for <span>hyperlink
  auditing</span>.</p>

  <p>For <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements that represent
  hyperlinks, the relationship between the document containing the
  hyperlink and the destination resource indicated by the hyperlink is
  given by the value of the element's <dfn
  title="attr-hyperlink-rel"><code>rel</code></dfn> attribute, which
  must be a <span>set of space-separated tokens</span>. The <a
  href="#linkTypes">allowed values and their meanings</a> are defined
  below. The <code title="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code> attribute has
  no default value. If the attribute is omitted or if none of the
  values in the attribute are recognized by the UA, then the document
  has no particular relationship with the destination resource other
  than there being a hyperlink between the two.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-hyperlink-media"><code>media</code></dfn>
  attribute describes for which media the target document was
  designed. It is purely advisory. The value must be a valid <a
  href="#mq">media query</a>. <a href="#refsMQ">[MQ]</a> The default,
  if the <code title="attr-hyperlink-media">media</code> attribute is
  omitted, is <code>all</code>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-hyperlink-hreflang"><code>hreflang</code></dfn>
  attribute on hyperlink elements, if present, gives the language of
  the linked resource. It is purely advisory. The value must be a
  valid RFC 3066 language code. <a href="#refsRFC3066">[RFC3066]</a>
  User agents must not consider this attribute authoritative &mdash;
  upon fetching the resource, user agents must use only language
  information associated with the resource to determine its language,
  not metadata included in the link to the resource.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-hyperlink-type"><code>type</code></dfn>
  attribute, if present, gives the MIME type of the linked
  resource. It is purely advisory. The value must be a valid MIME
  type, optionally with parameters. <a
  href="#refsRFC2046">[RFC2046]</a> User agents must not consider the
  <code title="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code> attribute
  authoritative &mdash; upon fetching the resource, user agents must
  not use metadata included in the link to the resource to determine
  its type.</p>



  <h4><dfn>Following hyperlinks</dfn></h4>

  <p>When a user <em>follows a hyperlink</em>, the user agent must
  <span title="resolve a url">resolve</span> the <span>URL</span>
  given by the <code title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> attribute
  of that hyperlink, relative to the hyperlink element, and if that is
  successful, must <span>navigate</span> a <span>browsing
  context</span> to the resulting <span>absolute URL</span>. In the
  case of server-side image maps, the URL of the hyperlink must
  further have its <var>hyperlink suffix</var> appended to it.</p>

  <p>If <span title="resolve a url">resolving</span> the
  <span>URL</span> fails, the user agent may report the error to the
  user in a user-agent-specific manner, may navigate to an error page
  to report the error, or may ignore the error and do nothing.</p>

  <p>If the user indicated a specific <span>browsing context</span>
  when following the hyperlink, or if the user agent is configured to
  follow hyperlinks by navigating a particular browsing context, then
  that must be the <span>browsing context</span> that is
  navigated.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the hyperlink element is an <code>a</code> or
  <code>area</code> element that has a <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-target">target</code> attribute, then the
  <span>browsing context</span> that is navigated must be chosen by
  applying <span>the rules for choosing a browsing context given a
  browsing context name</span>, using the value of the <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-target">target</code> attribute as the
  browsing context name. If these rules result in the creation of a
  new <span>browsing context</span>, it must be navigated with
  <span>replacement enabled</span>.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the hyperlink element is a <span
  title="rel-sidebar-hyperlink">sidebar hyperlink</span> and the user
  agent implements a feature that can be considered a secondary
  browsing context, such a secondary browsing context may be selected
  as the browsing context to be navigated.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the hyperlink element is an <code>a</code> or
  <code>area</code> element with no <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-target">target</code> attribute, but one of
  the child nodes of <span>the <code>head</code> element</span> is a
  <code>base</code> element with a <code
  title="attr-base-target">target</code> attribute, then the browsing
  context that is navigated must be chosen by applying <span>the rules
  for choosing a browsing context given a browsing context name</span>,
  using the value of the <code title="attr-base-target">target</code>
  attribute of the first such <code>base</code> element as the
  browsing context name. If these rules result in the creation of a
  new <span>browsing context</span>, it must be navigated with
  <span>replacement enabled</span>.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the browsing context that must be navigated is the
  same browsing context as the one which the hyperlink element itself
  is in.</p>

  <p>The navigation must be done with the <span>browsing
  context</span> that contains the <code>Document</code> object with
  which the hyperlink's element in question is associated as the
  <span>source browsing context</span>.</p>


  <h5><dfn>Hyperlink auditing</dfn></h5>

  <p>If an <code>a</code> or <code>area</code> hyperlink element has a
  <code title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute, and the
  user follows the hyperlink, and the hyperlink's <span>URL</span> can
  be <span title="resolve a url">resolved</span>, relative to the
  hyperlink element, without failure, then the user agent must take
  the <code title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute's value,
  <span title="split a string on spaces">split that string on
  spaces</span>, <span title="resolve a url">resolve</span> each
  resulting token relative to the hyperlink element, and then should
  send a request (as described below) to each of the resulting <span
  title="absolute URL">absolute URLs</span>. (Tokens that fail to
  resolve are ignored.) This may be done in parallel with the primary
  request, and is independent of the result of that request.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow the user to adjust this behavior, for
  example in conjunction with a setting that disables the sending of
  HTTP <code title="http-referer">Referer</code> headers. Based on the
  user's preferences, UAs may either <span>ignore</span> the <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute altogether, or
  selectively ignore URLs in the list (e.g. ignoring any third-party
  URLs).</p>

  <p>For URLs that are HTTP URLs, the requests must be performed by
  <span title="fetch">fetching</span> the specified URLs using the
  POST method, with an entity body with the MIME type <code
  title="">text/ping</code> consisting of the four-character string
  "<code title="">PING</code>". All relevant cookie and HTTP
  authentication headers must be included in the request. Which other
  headers are required depends on the URLs involved.</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If both the <span title="the document's address">address</span>
   of the <code>Document</code> object containing the hyperlink being
   audited and the ping URL have the <span>same origin</span></dt>

   <dd>The request must include a <code
   title="http-ping-from">Ping-From</code> HTTP header with, as its
   value, the <span title="the document's address">address</span> of
   the document containing the hyperlink, and a <code
   title="http-ping-to">Ping-To</code> HTTP header with, as its value,
   the address of the <span>absolute URL</span> of the target of the
   hyperlink. The request must not include a <code
   title="http-referer">Referer</code> HTTP header. <!-- because
   otherwise it would look like a trustable same-origin POST --></dd>

   <dt>Otherwise, if the origins are different, but the document
   containing the hyperlink being audited was not retrieved over an
   encrypted connection</dt>

   <dd>The request must include a <code title="">Referer</code> HTTP
   header [sic] with, as its value, the <span title="the document's
   address">address</span> of the document containing the hyperlink, a
   <code title="http-ping-from">Ping-From</code> HTTP header with the
   same value, and a <code title="http-ping-to">Ping-To</code> HTTP
   header with, as its value, the address of the target of the
   hyperlink.</dd>

   <dt>Otherwise, the origins are different and the document
   containing the hyperlink being audited was retrieved over an
   encrypted connection</dt>

   <dd>The request must include a <code
   title="http-ping-to">Ping-To</code> HTTP header with, as its value,
   the address of the target of the hyperlink. The request must
   neither include a <code title="">Referer</code> HTTP header nor
   include a <code title="http-ping-from">Ping-From</code> HTTP
   header.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>In addition, an <code title="http-origin">XXX-Origin</code> header
  must always be included, whose value is the <span title="ASCII
  serialization of an origin">ASCII serialization</span> of the
  <span>origin</span> of the the <code>Document</code> containing the
  <span>hyperlink</span>. The value of the <code
  title="http-origin">XXX-Origin</code> header must be set to "<code
  title="">null</code>" when following redirects if the <span
  title="origin">origins</span> of all the <span
  title="URL">URLs</span> involved are not the <span title="same
  origin">same</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">To save bandwidth, implementors might also wish to
  consider omitting optional headers such as <code>Accept</code> from
  these requests.</p>

  <p>User agents must, unless otherwise specified by the user, honor
  the HTTP headers (including, in particular, redirects and HTTP
  cookie headers), but must ignore any entity bodies returned in the
  responses. User agents may close the connection prematurely once
  they start receiving an entity body. <a
  href="#refsRFC2109">[RFC2109]</a> <a
  href="#refsRFC2965">[RFC2965]</a></p>

  <p>For URLs that are not HTTP URLs, the requests must be performed
  by <span title="fetch">fetching</span> the specified URL normally,
  and discarding the results.</p>

  <p>When the <code title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute is
  present, user agents should clearly indicate to the user that
  following the hyperlink will also cause secondary requests to be
  sent in the background, possibly including listing the actual target
  URLs.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, a visual user agent could include
  the hostnames of the target ping URLs along with the hyperlink's
  actual URL in a status bar or tooltip.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p>The <code title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute is redundant
   with pre-existing technologies like HTTP redirects and JavaScript
   in allowing Web pages to track which off-site links are most
   popular or allowing advertisers to track click-through rates.</p>

   <p>However, the <code title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute
   provides these advantages to the user over those alternatives:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>It allows the user to see the final target URL
    unobscured.</li>

    <li>It allows the UA to inform the user about the out-of-band
    notifications.</li>

    <li>It allows the paranoid user to disable the notifications
    without losing the underlying link functionality.</li>

    <li>It allows the UA to optimize the use of available network
    bandwidth so that the target page loads faster.</li>

   </ul>
  
   <p>Thus, while it is possible to track users without this feature,
   authors are encouraged to use the <code
   title="attr-hyperlink-ping">ping</code> attribute so that the user agent
   can improve <!-- XXX optimize? --> the user experience.</p> <!--
   XXX need a better way to end that sentence. It's what I mean, but
   it sounds kooky. -->

  </div>

  <!-- resolving ping urls happens at audit time, so base URL changes
  affect the values of ping attributes -->



  <h4 id="linkTypes">Link types</h4>

  <p>The following table summarizes the link types that are defined by
  this specification. This table is non-normative; the actual
  definitions for the link types are given in the next few
  sections.</p>

  <p>In this section, the term <i>referenced document</i> refers to
  the resource identified by the element representing the link, and
  the term <i>current document</i> refers to the resource within
  which the element representing the link finds itself.</p>

  <p>To determine which link types apply to a <code>link</code>,
  <code>a</code>, or <code>area</code> element, the element's <code
  title="">rel</code> attribute must be <span title="split a string on
  spaces">split on spaces</span>. The resulting tokens are the link
  types that apply to that element.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified, a keyword must not be specified more
  than once per <code title="attr-rel-hyperlink">rel</code>
  attribute.</p>

  <p>The link types are <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> values,
  and must be compared as such.</p>

  <p class="example">Thus, <code title="">rel="next"</code> is the
  same as <code title="">rel="NEXT"</code>.</p>

  keyword <code title="rel-stylesheet">stylesheet</code>, it creates a
  <span title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>; but if it
  <em>does</em> also contain the keyword <code
  title="rel-stylesheet">stylesheet</code>, the <code
  title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> keyword instead modifies the
  meaning of the <code title="rel-stylesheet">stylesheet</code>
  keyword in the way described for that keyword, and the rest of this
  subsection doesn't apply.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> keyword
  indicates that the referenced document is an alternate
  representation of the current document.</p>

  <p>The nature of the referenced document is given by the <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-media">media</code>, <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-hreflang">hreflang</code>, and <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code> attributes.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> keyword is
  used with the <code title="attr-hyperlink-media">media</code>
  attribute, it indicates that the referenced document is intended for use
  with the media specified.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> keyword is
  used with the <code title="attr-hyperlink-hreflang">hreflang</code>
  attribute, and that attribute's value differs from the <span>root
  element</span>'s <span>language</span>, it indicates that the
  referenced document is a translation.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> keyword is
  used with the <code title="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code>
  attribute, it indicates that the referenced document is a
  reformulation of the current document in the specified format.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-hyperlink-media">media</code>, <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-hreflang">hreflang</code>, and <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code> attributes can be combined
  when specified with the <code title="rel-alternate">alternate</code>
  keyword.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, the following link is a French translation that
   uses the PDF format:</p>

   <pre>&lt;link rel=alternate type=application/pdf hreflang=fr href=manual-fr></pre>

  </div>

  <p>If the <code title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> keyword is
  used with the <code title="attr-hyperlink-type">type</code>
  attribute set to the value <code title="">application/rss+xml</code>
  or the value <code title="">application/atom+xml</code>, then the
  user agent must treat the link as it would if it had the <code
  title="rel-feed">feed</code> keyword specified as well.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> link
  relationship is transitive &mdash; that is, if a document links to
  two other documents with the link type "<code
  title="rel-alternate">alternate</code>", then, in addition to
  implying that those documents are alternative representations of the
  first document, it is also implying that those two documents are
  alternative representations of each other.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-archives"><code>archives</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-archives">archives</code> keyword may be
  used with <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-archives">archives</code> keyword indicates
  that the referenced document describes a collection of records,
  documents, or other materials of historical interest.</p>

  <p class="example">A blog's index page could link to an index of the
  blog's past posts with <code title="">rel="archives"</code>.</p>

  <p><strong>Synonyms</strong>: For historical reasons, user agents
  must also treat the keyword "<code title="">archive</code>" like the
  <code title="rel-archives">archives</code> keyword.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-author"><code>author</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-author">author</code> keyword may be
  used with <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>For <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements, the <code
  title="rel-author">author</code> keyword indicates that the
  referenced document provides further information about the author of
  the section that the element defining the hyperlink <a
  href="#applyToSection">applies</a> to.</p>

  <p>For <code>link</code> elements, the <code
  title="rel-author">author</code> keyword indicates that the
  referenced document provides further information about the author
  for the page as a whole.</p>

  <p class="note">The "referenced document" can be, and often is, a
  <code title="">mailto:</code> URL giving the e-mail address of the
  author. <a href="#refsMAILTO">[MAILTO]</a></p>

  <p><strong>Synonyms</strong>: For historical reasons, user agents
  must also treat <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and
  <code>area</code> elements that have a <code title="">rev</code>
  attribute with the value "<code>made</code>" as having the <code
  title="rel-author">author</code> keyword specified as a link
  relationship.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-bookmark"><code>bookmark</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-bookmark">bookmark</code> keyword may be
  used with <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-bookmark">bookmark</code> keyword gives a
  permalink for the nearest ancestor <code>article</code> element of
  the linking element in question, or of <a
  href="#associatedSection">the section the linking element is most
  closely associated with</a>, if there are no ancestor
  <code>article</code> elements.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following snippet has three permalinks. A user agent could
   determine which permalink applies to which part of the spec by
   looking at where the permalinks are given.</p>
   <pre> ...
 &lt;body>
  &lt;h1>Example of permalinks&lt;/h1>
  &lt;div id="a">
   &lt;h2>First example&lt;/h2>
   &lt;p>&lt;a href="a.html" rel="bookmark">This&lt;/a> permalink applies to
   only the content from the first H2 to the second H2. The DIV isn't
   exactly that section, but it roughly corresponds to it.&lt;/p>
  &lt;/div>
  &lt;h2>Second example&lt;/h2>
  &lt;article id="b">
   &lt;p>&lt;a href="b.html" rel="bookmark">This&lt;/a> permalink applies to
   the outer ARTICLE element (which could be, e.g., a blog post).&lt;/p>
   &lt;article id="c">
    &lt;p>&lt;a href="c.html" rel="bookmark">This&lt;/a> permalink applies to
    the inner ARTICLE element (which could be, e.g., a blog comment).&lt;/p>
   &lt;/article>
  &lt;/article>
 &lt;/body>
 ...</pre>
  </div>

<!-- (commented out on the assumption that rel=contact is really XFN)
  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-contact"><code>contact</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-contact">contact</code> keyword may be used
  with <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>For <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements, the <code
  title="rel-contact">contact</code> keyword indicates that the
  referenced document provides further contact information for the
  section that the element defining the hyperlink <a
  href="#applyToSection">applies</a> to.</p>

  <p>User agents must treat any hyperlink in an <code>address</code>
  element as having the <code title="rel-contact">contact</code> link
  type specified.</p>

  <p>For <code>link</code> elements, the <code
  title="rel-contact">contact</code> keyword indicates that the
  referenced document provides further contact information for the
  page as a whole.</p>
-->

  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-external"><code>external</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-external">external</code> keyword may be
  used with <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-external">external</code> keyword indicates
  that the link is leading to a document that is not part of the site
  that the current document forms a part of.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-feed"><code>feed</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-feed">feed</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-feed">feed</code> keyword indicates that the
  referenced document is a syndication feed. If the <code
  title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> link type is also specified,
  then the feed is specifically the feed for the current document;
  otherwise, the feed is just a syndication feed, not necessarily
  associated with a particular Web page.</p>

  <p>The first <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, or <code>area</code>
  element in the document (in tree order) that creates a hyperlink
  with the link type <code title="rel-feed">feed</code> must be
  treated as the default syndication feed for the purposes of feed
  autodiscovery.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code title="rel-feed">feed</code> keyword is
  implied by the <code title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> link
  type in certain cases (q.v.).</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following two <code>link</code> elements are equivalent:
   both give the syndication feed for the current page:</p>
   <pre>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="data.xml"></pre>
   <pre>&lt;link rel="feed alternate" href="data.xml"></pre>
   <p>The following extract offers various different syndication
   feeds:</p>
   <pre> &lt;p>You can access the planets database using Atom feeds:&lt;/p>
 &lt;ul>
  &lt;li>&lt;a href="recently-visited-planets.xml" rel="feed">Recently Visited Planets&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;a href="known-bad-planets.xml" rel="feed">Known Bad Planets&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;a href="unexplored-planets.xml" rel="feed">Unexplored Planets&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;/ul></pre>
  </div>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-help"><code>help</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-help">help</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>For <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements, the <code
  title="rel-help">help</code> keyword indicates that the referenced
  document provides further help information for the parent of the
  element defining the hyperlink, and its children.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the form control has associated
   context-sensitive help. The user agent could use this information,
   for example, displaying the referenced document if the user presses
   the "Help" or "F1" key.</p>

   <pre> &lt;p>&lt;label> Topic: &lt;input name=topic> &lt;a href="help/topic.html" rel="help">(Help)&lt;/a>&lt;/label>&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <p>For <code>link</code> elements, the <code
  title="rel-help">help</code> keyword indicates that the referenced
  document provides help for the page as a whole.</p>


  <h5 id=rel-icon>Link type "<dfn title="rel-icon"><code>icon</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-icon">icon</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code> elements, for which it creates an <span
  title="external resource link">external resource link</span>.</p>

  <p>The specified resource is an icon representing the page or site,
  and should be used by the user agent when representing the page in
  the user interface.</p>

  <p>Icons could be auditory icons, visual icons, or other kinds of
  icons. If multiple icons are provided, the user agent must select
  the most appropriate icon according to the <code
  title="attr-link-type">type</code>, <code
  title="attr-link-media">media</code>, and <code
  title="attr-link-sizes">sizes</code> attributes. If there are
  multiple equally appropriate icons, user agents must use the last
  one declared in <span>tree order</span>. If the user agent tries to
  use an icon but that icon is determined, upon closer examination, to
  in fact be inappropriate (e.g. because it uses an unsupported
  format), then the user agent must try the next-most-appropriate icon
  as determined by the attributes.</p>

  <p>There is no default type for resources given by the <code
  title="rel-icon">icon</code> keyword. However, for the purposes of
  <a href="#concept-link-type-sniffing">determining the type of the
  resource</a>, user agents must expect the resource to be an image.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-sizes"><code>sizes</code></dfn>
  attribute gives the sizes of icons for visual media.</p>

  <p>If specified, the attribute must have a value that is an
  <span>unordered set of unique space-separated tokens</span>. The
  values must all be either <code
  title="attr-link-sizes-any">any</code> or a value that consists of
  two <span title="valid non-negative integer">valid non-negative
  integers</span> that do not have a leading U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0)
  character and that are separated by a single U+0078 LATIN SMALL
  LETTER X character.</p>

  <p>The keywords represent icon sizes.</p>

  <p>To parse and process the attribute's value, the user agent must
  first <span title="split a string on spaces">split the attribute's
  value on spaces</span>, and must then parse each resulting keyword
  to determine what it represents.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-link-sizes-any"><code>any</code></dfn> keyword
  represents that the resource contains a scalable icon, e.g. as
  provided by an SVG image.</p>

  <p>Other keywords must be further parsed as follows to determine
  what they represent:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><p>If the keyword doesn't contain exactly one U+0078 LATIN
   SMALL LETTER X character, then this keyword doesn't represent
   anything. Abort these steps for that keyword.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">width string</var> be the string before
   the "<code title="">x</code>".</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">height string</var> be the string after the
   "<code title="">x</code>".</p></li>

   <li><p>If either <var title="">width string</var> or <var
   title="">height string</var> start with a U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0)
   character or contain any characters other than characters in the
   range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9), then this
   keyword doesn't represent anything. Abort these steps for that
   keyword.</p></li>

   <li><p>Apply the <span>rules for parsing non-negative
   integers</span> to <var title="">width string</var> to obtain <var
   title="">width</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Apply the <span>rules for parsing non-negative
   integers</span> to <var title="">height string</var> to obtain <var
   title="">height</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The keyword represents that the resource contains a bitmap
   icon with a width of <var title="">width</var> device pixels and a
   height of <var title="">height</var> device pixels.</p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>The keywords specified on the <code
  title="attr-link-sizes">sizes</code> attribute must not represent
  icon sizes that are not actually available in the linked
  resource.</p>

  <p>If the attribute is not specified, then the user agent must
  assume that the given icon is appropriate, but less appropriate than
  an icon of a known and appropriate size.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following snippet shows the top part of an application with
   several icons.</p>

  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-license"><code>license</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-license">license</code> keyword may be used
  with <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-license">license</code> keyword indicates
  that the referenced document provides the copyright license terms
  under which the current document is provided.</p>

  <p><strong>Synonyms</strong>: For historical reasons, user agents
  must also treat the keyword "<code title="">copyright</code>" like
  the <code title="rel-license">license</code> keyword.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-nofollow"><code>nofollow</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-nofollow">nofollow</code> keyword may be
  used with <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-nofollow">nofollow</code> keyword indicates
  that the link is not endorsed by the original author or publisher of
  the page, or that the link to the referenced document was included
  primarily because of a commercial relationship between people
  affiliated with the two pages.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-noreferrer"><code>noreferrer</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-noreferrer">noreferrer</code> keyword may be
  used with <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements.</p>

  <p>If a user agent follows a link defined by an <code>a</code> or
  <code>area</code> element that has the <code
  title="rel-noreferrer">noreferrer</code> keyword, the user agent
  must not include a <code title="">Referer</code> HTTP header (<span
  title="concept-http-equivalent-headers">or equivalent</span> for
  other protocols) in the request.</p>

  <p>This keyword also <a href="#noopener">causes the <code
  title="dom-opener">opener</code> attribute to remain null</a> if the
  hyperlink creates a new <span>browsing context</span>.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-pingback"><code>pingback</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-pingback">pingback</code> keyword may be
  used with <code>link</code> elements, for which it creates an <span
  title="external resource link">external resource link</span>.</p>

  <p>For the semantics of the <code
  title="rel-pingback">pingback</code> keyword, see the Pingback 1.0
  specification. <a href="#refsPINGBACK">[PINGBACK]</a></p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-prefetch"><code>prefetch</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-prefetch">prefetch</code> keyword may be
  used with <code>link</code> elements, for which it creates an <span
  title="external resource link">external resource link</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-prefetch">prefetch</code> keyword indicates
  that preemptively fetching and caching the specified resource is
  likely to be beneficial, as it is highly likely that the user will
  require this resource.</p>

  <p>There is no default type for resources given by the <code
  title="rel-prefetch">prefetch</code> keyword.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-search"><code>search</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-search">search</code> keyword may be used
  with <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-search">search</code> keyword indicates that
  the referenced document provides an interface specifically for
  searching the document and its related resources.</p>

  <p class="note">OpenSearch description documents can be used with
  <code>link</code> elements and the <code
  title="rel-search">search</code> link type to enable user agents to
  autodiscover search interfaces. <a

  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-stylesheet"><code>stylesheet</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-stylesheet">stylesheet</code> keyword may be
  used with <code>link</code> elements, for which it creates an <span
  title="external resource link">external resource link</span> that
  contributes to the <span>styling processing model</span>.</p>

  <p>The specified resource is a resource that describes how to
  present the document. Exactly how the resource is to be processed
  depends on the actual type of the resource.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="rel-alternate">alternate</code> keyword is
  also specified on the <code>link</code> element, then the link is an
  alternative stylesheet; in this case, the <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute must be specified on the
  <code>link</code> element, with a non-empty value.</p>

  <p>The default type for resources given by the <code
  title="rel-stylesheet">stylesheet</code> keyword is <code
  title="">text/css</code>.</p>

  <p><strong>Quirk:</strong> If the document has been set to
  <span>quirks mode</span> and the <span
  title="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span> of the external
  resource is not a supported style sheet type, the user agent must
  instead assume it to be <code title="">text/css</code>.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-sidebar"><code>sidebar</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-sidebar">sidebar</code> keyword may be used
  with <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-sidebar">sidebar</code> keyword indicates
  that the referenced document, if retrieved, is intended to be shown
  in a <span>secondary browsing context</span> (if possible), instead
  of in the current <span>browsing context</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span title="hyperlink">hyperlink element</span> with with the
  <code title="rel-sidebar">sidebar</code> keyword specified is a <dfn
  title="rel-sidebar-hyperlink">sidebar hyperlink</dfn>.</p>


  <h5>Link type "<dfn title="rel-tag"><code>tag</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code title="rel-tag">tag</code> keyword may be used
  with <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-tag">tag</code> keyword indicates that the
  <em>tag</em> that the referenced document represents applies to the
  current document.</p>

  <p class="note">Since it indicates that the tag <em>applies to the
  current document</em>, it would be inappropriate to use this keyword
  in the markup of a <a href="#tag-cloud">tag cloud</a>, which lists
  the popular tag across a set of pages.</p>


  <h5>Hierarchical link types</h5>

  <p>Some documents form part of a hierarchical structure of
  documents.</p>

  <p>A hierarchical structure of documents is one where each document
  can have various subdocuments. The document of which a document is a
  subdocument is said to be the document's <em>parent</em>. A document
  with no parent forms the top of the hierarchy.</p>

  <p>A document may be part of multiple hierarchies.</p>


  <h6>Link type "<dfn title="rel-index"><code>index</code></dfn>"</h6>

  <p>The <code title="rel-index">index</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-index">index</code> keyword indicates that
  the document is part of a hierarchical structure, and that the link
  is leading to the document that is the top of the hierarchy. It
  conveys more information when used with the <code
  title="rel-up">up</code> keyword (q.v.).</p>

  <p><strong>Synonyms</strong>: For historical reasons, user agents
  must also treat the keywords "<code title="">top</code>", "<code
  title="">contents</code>", and "<code title="">toc</code>" like the
  <code title="rel-index">index</code> keyword.</p>


  <h6>Link type "<dfn title="rel-up"><code>up</code></dfn>"</h6>

  <p>The <code title="rel-up">up</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-up">up</code> keyword indicates that the
  document is part of a hierarchical structure, and that the link is
  leading to the document that is the parent of the current
  document.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-up">up</code> keyword may be repeated within
  a <code title="attr-hyperlink-rel">rel</code> attribute to indicate
  the hierarchical distance from the current document to the
  referenced document. Each occurrence of the keyword represents one
  further level. If the <code title="rel-index">index</code> keyword
  is also present, then the number of <code title="rel-up">up</code>
  keywords is the depth of the current page relative to the top of the
  hierarchy. Only one link is created for the set of one or more <code
  title="rel-up">up</code> keywords and, if present, the <code
  title="rel-index">index</code> keyword.</p>

  <p>If the page is part of multiple hierarchies, then they should be
  described in different <span
  title="paragraph">paragraphs</span>. User agents must scope any
  interpretation of the <code title="rel-up">up</code> and <code
  title="rel-index">index</code> keywords together indicating the
  depth of the hierarchy to the <span>paragraph</span> in which the
  link finds itself, if any, or to the document otherwise.</p>

  <p>When two links have both the <code title="rel-up">up</code> and
  <code title="rel-index">index</code> keywords specified together in
  the same scope and contradict each other by having a different
  number of <code title="rel-up">up</code> keywords, the link with the
  greater number of <code title="rel-up">up</code> keywords must be
  taken as giving the depth of the document.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This can be used to mark up a navigation style sometimes known
   as bread crumbs. In the following example, the current page can be
   reached via two paths.</p>

   <pre>&lt;nav>
 &lt;p>
  &lt;a href="/" rel="index up up up">Main&lt;/a> &gt;
  &lt;a href="/products/" rel="up up">Products&lt;/a> &gt;

  &lt;a href="/" rel="index up up">Main&lt;/a> &gt;
  &lt;a href="/second-hand/" rel="up">Second hand&lt;/a> &gt;
  &lt;a>Dishwashers&lt;/a>
 &lt;/p>
&lt;/nav></pre>

  </div>

  <p class="note">The <code title="dom-a-relList">relList</code> DOM
  attribute (e.g. on the <code>a</code> element) does not currently
  represent multiple <code title="rel-up">up</code> keywords (the
  interface hides duplicates).</p>


  <h5>Sequential link types</h5>

  <p>Some documents form part of a sequence of documents.</p>

  <p>A sequence of documents is one where each document can have a
  <em>previous sibling</em> and a <em>next sibling</em>. A document
  with no previous sibling is the start of its sequence, a document
  with no next sibling is the end of its sequence.</p>

  <p>A document may be part of multiple sequences.</p>


  <h6>Link type "<dfn title="rel-first"><code>first</code></dfn>"</h6>

  <p>The <code title="rel-first">first</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-first">first</code> keyword indicates that
  the document is part of a sequence, and that the link is leading to
  the document that is the first logical document in the sequence.</p>

  <p><strong>Synonyms</strong>: For historical reasons, user agents
  must also treat the keywords "<code title="">begin</code>" and
  "<code title="">start</code>" like the <code
  title="rel-first">first</code> keyword.</p>


  <h6>Link type "<dfn title="rel-last"><code>last</code></dfn>"</h6>

  <p>The <code title="rel-last">last</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-last">last</code> keyword indicates that the
  document is part of a sequence, and that the link is leading to the
  document that is the last logical document in the sequence.</p>

  <p><strong>Synonyms</strong>: For historical reasons, user agents
  must also treat the keyword "<code title="">end</code>" like the
  <code title="rel-last">last</code> keyword.</p>


  <h6>Link type "<dfn title="rel-next"><code>next</code></dfn>"</h6>

  <p>The <code title="rel-next">next</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-next">next</code> keyword indicates that the
  document is part of a sequence, and that the link is leading to the
  document that is the next logical document in the sequence.</p>


  <h6>Link type "<dfn title="rel-prev"><code>prev</code></dfn>"</h6>

  <p>The <code title="rel-prev">prev</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>area</code>
  elements. For <code>link</code> elements, it creates a <span
  title="hyperlink link">hyperlink</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="rel-prev">prev</code> keyword indicates that the
  document is part of a sequence, and that the link is leading to the
  document that is the previous logical document in the sequence.</p>

  <p><strong>Synonyms</strong>: For historical reasons, user agents
  must also treat the keyword "<code title="">previous</code>" like
  the <code title="rel-prev">prev</code> keyword.</p>


  <h5>Other link types</h5>

  <p>Other than the types defined above, only types defined as
  extensions in the <a

   <dd>

    <p>One of the following:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt>Proposal</dt>

     <dd>The keyword has not received wide peer review and
     approval. It is included for completeness because pages use the
     keyword. Pages should not use the keyword.</dd>

     <dt>Accepted</dt>

     <dd>The keyword has received wide peer review and approval. It
     has a specification that unambiguously defines how to handle
     pages that use the keyword, including when they use them in
     incorrect ways. Pages may use the keyword.</dd>

     <dt>Rejected</dt>

     <dd>The keyword has received wide peer review and it has been
     found to have significant problems. Pages must not use the
     keyword. When a keyword has this status, the "Effect
     on... <code>link</code>" and "Effect on... <code>a</code> and
     <code>area</code>" information should be set to "not
     allowed".</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>If a keyword is added with the "proposal" status and found to
    be redundant with existing values, it should be removed and listed
    as a synonym for the existing value. If a keyword is added with
    the "proposal" status and found to be harmful, then it should be
    changed to "rejected" status, and its "Effect on..." information
    should be changed accordingly.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Conformance checkers must use the information given on the WHATWG
  Wiki RelExtensions page to establish if a value not explicitly
  defined in this specification is allowed or not. When an author uses
  a new type not defined by either this specification or the Wiki
  page, conformance checkers should offer to add the value to the
  Wiki, with the details described above, with the "proposal"
  status.</p>

  <p>This specification does not define how new values will get
  approved. It is expected that the Wiki will have a community that
  addresses this.</p>




  <h2 id="editing"><dfn>User Interaction</dfn></h2>

  <p>This section describes various features that allow authors to
  enable users to edit documents and parts of documents
  interactively.</p>

  <h3 id="editing-intro">Introduction</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p class="XXX">Would be nice to explain how these features
  work together.</p>



  <h3>The <dfn title="attr-hidden"><code>hidden</code></dfn> attribute</h3>

  <p>All elements may have the <code title="attr-hidden">hidden</code>
  content attribute set. The <code title="attr-hidden">hidden</code>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>. When specified on an
  element, it indicates that the element is not yet, or is no longer,
  relevant. User agents should not render elements that have the <code
  title="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute specified.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following skeletal example, the attribute is used to hide
   the Web game's main screen until the user logs in:</p>

   <pre>  &lt;h1>The Example Game&lt;/h1>
  &lt;section id="login">
   &lt;h2>Login&lt;/h2>
   &lt;form>
    ...
    &lt;!-- calls login() once the user's credentials have been checked -->
   &lt;/form>
   &lt;script>
    function login() {
      // switch screens
      document.getElementById('login').hidden = true;
      document.getElementById('game').hidden = false;
    }
   &lt;/script>
  &lt;/section>
  &lt;section id="game" hidden>
   ...
  &lt;/section></pre>

  </div>

  <p>The <code title="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute must not be
  used to hide content that could legitimately be shown in another
  presentation. For example, it is incorrect to use <code
  title="attr-hidden">hidden</code> to hide panels in a tabbed dialog,
  because the tabbed interface is merely a kind of overflow
  presentation &mdash; showing all the form controls in one big page
  with a scrollbar would be equivalent, and no less correct.</p>

  <p>Elements in a section hidden by the <code
  title="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute are still active,
  e.g. scripts and form controls in such sections still render execute
  and submit respectively. Only their presentation to the user
  changes.</p>

  <!-- XXX might be worth disabling user interaction event submission
  in hidden areas? e.g. make onmousemove and onclick and form controls
  not respond to input? -->

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-hidden"><code>hidden</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the content attribute of the
  same name.</p>



  <h3>Activation</h3>

  <p>Each element has a <var title="">click in progress</var> flag,
  initially set to false.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-click">click()</dfn> method must run these
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the element's <var title="">click in progress</var> flag
   is set to true, then abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <var title="">click in progress</var> flag on the
   element to true.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element has a defined <span>activation behavior</span>,
   <span>run synthetic click activation steps</span> on the
   element. Otherwise, <span>fire a <code>click</code> event</span> at
   the element.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <var title="">click in progress</var> flag on the
   element to false.</p></li>

  </ol>



  <h3>Scrolling elements into view</h3>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-scrollIntoView"><code>scrollIntoView([<var
  title="">top</var>])</code></dfn> method, when called, must cause
  the element on which the method was called to have the attention of
  the user called to it.</p>

  <p class="note">In a speech browser, this could happen by having the
  current playback position move to the start of the given
  element.</p>

  <p>In visual user agents, if the argument is present and has the
  value false, the user agent should scroll the element into view such
  that both the bottom and the top of the element are in the viewport,
  with the bottom of the element aligned with the bottom of the
  viewport. If it isn't possible to show the entire element in that
  way, or if the argument is omitted or is true, then the user agent
  should instead align the top of the element with the top of the
  viewport. If the entire scrollable part of the content is visible
  all at once (e.g. if a page is shorter than the viewport), then the
  user agent should not scroll anything. Visual user agents should
  further scroll horizontally as necessary to bring the element to the
  attention of the user.</p>

  <p>Non-visual user agents may ignore the argument, or may treat it
  in some media-specific manner most useful to the user.</p>

  <!-- XXX maybe this should move to CSSOM -->

  <p>When an element is <i>focused</i>, key events received by the
  document must be targeted at that element. There may be no element
  focused; when no element is focused, key events received by the
  document must be targetted at <span>the body element</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents may track focus for each <span>browsing
  context</span> or <code>Document</code> individually, or may support
  only one focused elment per <span>top-level browsing context</span>
  &mdash; user agents should follow platform conventions in this
  regard.</p>

  <p>Which elements within a <span>top-level browsing context</span>
  currently have focus must be independent of whether or not the
  <span>top-level browsing context</span> itself has the <i>system
  focus</i>.</p>

  <p class="note">When an element is focused, the element matches the
  CSS <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class.</p>


  <h4>Sequential focus navigation</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-tabindex"><code>tabindex</code></dfn>
  content attribute specifies whether the element is focusable,
  whether it can be reached using sequential focus navigation, and the
  relative order of the element for the purposes of sequential focus
  navigation. The name "tab index" comes from the common use of the
  "tab" key to navigate through the focusable elements. The term
  "tabbing" refers to moving forward through the focusable elements
  that can be reached using sequential focus navigation.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute, if
  specified, must have a value that is a <span>valid
  integer</span>.</p>

  <p>If the attribute is specified, it must be parsed using the
  <span>rules for parsing integers</span>. The attribute's values have
  the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>If the attribute is omitted or parsing the value returns an
   error</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The user agent should follow platform conventions to determine if
    the element is to be focusable and, if so, whether the element can
    be reached using sequential focus navigation, and if so, what its
    relative order should be.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt id="negative-tabindex">If the value is a negative integer</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The user agent must allow the element to be focused, but should
    not allow the element to be reached using sequential focus
    navigation.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>If the value is a zero</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The user agent must allow the element to be focused, should
    allow the element to be reached using sequential focus navigation,
    and should follow platform conventions to determine the element's
    relative order.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>If the value is greater than zero</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The user agent must allow the element to be focused, should
    allow the element to be reached using sequential focus navigation,
    and should place the element in the sequential focus navigation
    order so that it is:</p>

    <ul>

     <li>before any focusable element whose <code
     title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has been
     omitted or whose value, when parsed, returns an error,</li>

     <li>before any focusable element whose <code
     title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value equal
     to or less than zero,</li>

     <li>after any element whose <code
     title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value
     greater than zero but less than the value of the <code
     title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute on the
     element,</li>

     <li>after any element whose <code
     title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value equal
     to the value of the <code title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code>
     attribute on the element but that is earlier in the document in
     <span>tree order</span> than the element,</li>

     <li>before any element whose <code
     title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value equal
     to the value of the <code title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code>
     attribute on the element but that is later in the document in
     <span>tree order</span> than the element, and</li>

     <li>before any element whose <code
     title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute has a value
     greater than the value of the <code
     title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute on the
     element.</li>

    </ul>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>An element is <dfn>focusable</dfn> if the <code
  title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute's definition above
  defines the element to be focusable <em>and</em> the element is
  <span>being rendered</span><!-- XXX xref, define display:none as not
  being rendered, off-screen as being rendered? -->.</p>

  <p>An element that is <span>focusable</span> but does not otherwise
  have an <span>activation behavior</span> defined has an
  <span>activation behavior</span> that does nothing.</p>

  <p class="note">This means that an element that is only focusable
  because of its <code title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute
  will fire a <code title="event-click">click</code> event in response
  to a non-mouse activation (e.g. hitting the "enter" key while the
  element is focused).</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-tabIndex"><code>tabIndex</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the value of the <code
  title="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> content attribute. If the
  attribute is not present, or parsing its value returns an error,
  then the DOM attribute must return 0 for elements that are focusable
  and &#x2212;1 for elements that are not focusable.</p>


  <h4 id="focus-management">Focus management</h4>

  <p>The <dfn>focusing steps</dfn> are as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If focusing the element will remove the focus from another
   element, then run the <span>unfocusing steps</span> for that
   element.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Make the element the currently focused element in its
    <span>top-level browsing context</span>.</p>

    <p>Some elements, most notably <code>area</code>, can correspond
    to more than one distinct focusable area. If a particular area was
    indicated when the element was focused, then that is the area that
    must get focus; otherwise, e.g. when using the <code
    title="dom-focus">focus()</code> method, the first such region in
    tree order is the one that must be focused.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p><span>Fire a simple event</span> that doesn't bubble called
   <code title="event-focus">focus</code> at the element.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>User agents must run the <span>focusing steps</span> for an
  element whenever the user moves the focus to a
  <span>focusable</span> element.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>unfocusing steps</dfn> are as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the element is an <code>input</code> element, and the
   <code title="event-input-change">change</code> event applies to the
   element, and the element does not have a defined <span>activation
   behavior</span>, and the user has changed the element's <span
   title="concept-fe-value">value</span> or its list of <span
   title="concept-input-type-file-selected">selected files</span>
   while the control was focused without committing that change, then
   <span>fire a simple event</span> called <code
   title="event-change">change</code> at the element, then
   <span>broadcast <code title="event-formchange">formchange</code>
   events</span> at the element's <span>form owner</span>.</p>

   <li><p>Unfocus the element.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Fire a simple event</span> that doesn't bubble called
   <code title="event-blur">blur</code> at the element.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>User agents should run the <span>unfocusing steps</span> for an
  element whenever the user moves the focus away from any
  <span>focusable</span> element.</p>


  <h4>Document-level focus APIs</h4>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-activeElement"><code>activeElement</code></dfn>
  attribute on <code>DocumentHTML</code> objects must return the
  element in the document that is focused. If no element in the
  <code>Document</code> is focused, this must return <span>the body
  element</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-hasFocus"><code>hasFocus()</code></dfn> method
  on <code>DocumentHTML</code> objects must return true if the
  document's <span>browsing context</span> is focused, and all its
  <span title="ancestor browsing context">ancestor browsing
  contexts</span> are also focused, and the <span>top-level browsing
  context</span> has the <i>system focus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-window-focus"><code>focus()</code></dfn>
  method on the <code>Window</code> object, when invoked, provides a
  hint to the user agent that the script believes the user might be
  interested in the contents of the <span>browsing context</span> of
  the <code>Window</code> object on which the method was invoked.</p>

  <p>User agents are encouraged to have this <code
  title="dom-window-blur">focus()</code> method trigger some kind of
  notification.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-window-blur"><code>blur()</code></dfn> method
  on the <code>Window</code> object, when invoked, provides a hint to
  the user agent that the script believes the user probably is not
  currently interested in the contents of the <span>browsing
  context</span> of the <code>Window</code> object on which the method
  was invoked, but that the contents might become interesting again in
  the future.</p>

  <p>User agents are encouraged to ignore calls to this <code
  title="dom-window-blur">blur()</code> method entirely.</p>

  <p class="note">Historically the <code
  title="dom-window-blur">focus()</code> and <code
  title="dom-window-blur">blur()</code> methods actually affected the
  system focus, but hostile sites widely abuse this behavior to the
  user's detriment.</p>


  <h4>Element-level focus APIs</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-focus"><code>focus()</code></dfn> method,
  when invoked, must run the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the element is marked as <i>locked for focus</i>, then abort
   these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element is not <span>focusable</span>, then abort these
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Mark the element as <dfn>locked for focus</dfn>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element is not already focused, run the <span>focusing
   steps</span> for the element.</p></li>

   <li><p>Unmark the element as <i>locked for focus</i>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-blur"><code>blur()</code></dfn> method, when
  invoked, should run the <span>unfocusing steps</span> for the
  element. User agents may selectively or uniformly ignore calls to
  this method for usability reasons.</p>



  <h3 id="selection">The text selection APIs</h3>

  <p>Every <span>browsing context</span> has <dfn title="the
  selection">a selection</dfn>. The selection can be empty, and the
  selection can have more than one range (a disjointed selection). The
  user agent should allow the user to change the selection. User
  agents are not required to let the user select more than one range,
  and may collapse multiple ranges in the selection to a single range
  when the user interacts with the selection. (But, of course, the
  user agent may let the user create selections with multiple
  ranges.)</p>

  <p>This one selection must be shared by all the content of the
  browsing context (though not by nested <span title="browsing
  context">browsing contexts</span>), including any editing hosts in
  the document. (Editing hosts that are not inside a document cannot
  have a selection.)</p>

  <p>If the selection is empty (collapsed, so that it has only one
  segment and that segment's start and end points are the same) then
  the selection's position should equal the caret position. When the
  selection is not empty, this specification does not define the caret
  position; user agents should follow platform conventions in deciding
  whether the caret is at the start of the selection, the end of the
  selection, or somewhere else.</p>

  <p>On some platforms (such as those using Wordstar editing
  conventions), the caret position is totally independent of the start
  and end of the selection, even when the selection is empty. On such
  platforms, user agents may ignore the requirement that the cursor
  position be linked to the position of the selection altogether.</p>

  <p>Mostly for historical reasons, in addition to the <span>browsing
  context</span>'s <span title="the selection">selection</span>, each
  <code>textarea</code> and <code>input</code> element has an
  independent selection. These are the <dfn title="text field
  selection">text field selections</dfn>.</p>

  <p>User agents may selectively ignore attempts to use the API to
  adjust the selection made after the user has modified the
  selection. For example, if the user has just selected part of a
  word, the user agent could ignore attempts to use the API call to
  immediately unselect the selection altogether, but could allow
  attempts to change the selection to select the entire word.</p>

  <p>User agents may also allow the user to create selections that are
  not exposed to the API.</p>

  <p>The <code>datagrid</code> and <code>select</code> elements also
  have selections, indicating which items have been picked by the
  user. These are not discussed in this section.</p>

  <p class="note">This specification does not specify how selections
  are presented to the user. The Selectors specification, in
  conjunction with CSS, can be used to style text selections using the
  <code title="selector-selection">::selection</code>
  pseudo-element. <a href="#refsSELECTORS">[SELECTORS]</a> <a

  This spec doesn't have everything from there yet, in particular
  selectionLanguageChange() and containsNode() are missing. They are missing
  because I couldn't work out how to define them in terms of Ranges.

  I also haven't included extend():

    void <span title="dom-selection-extend">extend</span>(in Node parentNode, in long offset);
    // raise if no range
    // raise WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR if parentNode not in document
    // do something

  ...mostly because I can't work out how to describe what it does quickly.

  <p>The <code>Selection</code> interface is represents a list of
  <code>Range</code> objects. The first item in the list has index 0,
  and the last item has index <var title="">count</var>-1, where
  <var title="">count</var> is the number of ranges in the list. <a
  href="#refsDOM2RANGE">[DOM2RANGE]</a></p>

  <p>All of the members of the <code>Selection</code> interface are
  defined in terms of operations on the <code>Range</code> objects
  represented by this object. These operations can raise exceptions,
  as defined for the <code>Range</code> interface; this can therefore
  result in the members of the <code>Selection</code> interface
  raising exceptions as well, in addition to any explicitly called out
  below.</p> <!-- XXX example -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-anchorNode"><code>anchorNode</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the value returned by the <code

  <p>The <dfn

  attribute must return the value returned by the <code
  title="">startOffset</code> attribute of the last <code>Range</code>
  object in the list, or 0 if the list is empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-focusNode"><code>focusNode</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the value returned by the <code

  <code>Range</code> object in the list, or null if the list is
  empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-focusOffset"><code>focusOffset</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the value returned by the <code
  title="">endOffset</code> attribute of the last <code>Range</code>
  object in the list, or 0 if the list is empty.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-isCollapsed"><code>isCollapsed</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if there are zero ranges, or if there is
  exactly one range and its <code title="">collapsed</code> attribute
  is itself true. Otherwise it must return false.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-selection-collapse"><code>collapse(<var
  title="">parentNode</var>, <var title="">offset</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must raise a <code>WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR</code> DOM exception if
  <var title="">parentNode</var>'s <code>Document</code> is not the
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> object with which the
  <code>Selection</code> object is associated. Otherwise it is, and
  the method must remove all the ranges in the <code>Selection</code>
  list, then create a new <code>Range</code> object, add it to the
  list, and invoke its <code title="">setStart()</code> and <code
  title="">setEnd()</code> methods with the <var
  title="">parentNode</var> and <var title="">offset</var> values as
  their arguments.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-collapseToStart"><code>collapseToStart()</code></dfn>
  method must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> DOM exception if
  there are no ranges in the list. Otherwise, it must invoke the <code
  title="dom-selection-collapse">collapse()</code> method with the
  <code title="">startContainer</code> and <code
  title="">startOffset</code> values of the first <code>Range</code>
  object in the list as the arguments.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-collapseToEnd"><code>collapseToEnd()</code></dfn>

  <code title="">endContainer</code> and <code
  title="">endOffset</code> values of the last <code>Range</code>
  object in the list as the arguments.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-selectAllChildren"><code>selectAllChildren(<var title="">parentNode</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must invoke the <code
  title="dom-selection-collapse">collapse()</code> method with the
  <var title="">parentNode</var> value as the first argument and 0 as the
  second argument, and must then invoke the <code
  title="">selectNodeContents()</code> method on the first (and only)
  range in the list with the <var title="">parentNode</var> value as the
  argument.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-deleteFromDocument"><code>deleteFromDocument()</code></dfn>
  method must invoke the <code title="">deleteContents()</code> method
  on each range in the list, if any, from first to last.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-rangeCount"><code>rangeCount</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of ranges in the list.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-getRangeAt"><code>getRangeAt(<var title="">index</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must return the <var title="">index</var>th range in the list. If
  <var title="">index</var> is less than zero or greater or equal to the value
  returned by the <code
  title="dom-selection-rangeCount">rangeCount</code> attribute, then
  the method must raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> DOM
  exception.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-addRange"><code>addRange(<var title="">range</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must add the given <var title="">range</var> Range object to the list
  of selections, at the end (so the newly added range is the new last
  range). Duplicates are not prevented; a range may be added more than
  once in which case it appears in the list more than once, which (for
  example) will cause <span
  title="dom-selection-toString">stringification</span> to return the
  range's text twice.</p> <!-- XXX how does this interact with
  deleteFromDocument() which acts on all ranges? -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-removeRange"><code>removeRange(<var title="">range</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must remove the first occurrence of <var title="">range</var> in the
  list of ranges, if it appears at all.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-selection-removeAllRanges"><code>removeAllRanges()</code></dfn>
  method must remove all the ranges from the list of ranges, such that
  the <code title="dom-selection-rangeCount">rangeCount</code>
  attribute returns 0 after the <code
  title="dom-selection-removeAllRanges">removeAllRanges()</code>
  method is invoked (and until a new range is added to the list,
  either through this interface or via user interaction).</p>

  <p>Objects implementing this interface must <dfn
  title="dom-selection-toString">stringify</dfn> to a concatenation
  of the results of invoking the <code title="">toString()</code>
  method of the <code>Range</code> object on each of the ranges of the

  <h4 id="textFieldSelection">APIs for the text field selections</h4>

  <p class="XXX">When we define HTMLTextAreaElement and
  HTMLInputElement we will have to add the IDL given below to both of
  their IDLs.</p>

  <p>The <code>input</code> and <code>textarea</code> elements define
  four members in their DOM interfaces for handling their text
  selection:</p>

  <pre class="idl">  void <span title="dom-textarea/input-select">select</span>();
           attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-textarea/input-selectionStart">selectionStart</span>;
           attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-textarea/input-selectionEnd">selectionEnd</span>;
  void <span title="dom-textarea/input-setSelectionRange">setSelectionRange</span>(in unsigned long start, in unsigned long end);</pre>
<!-- XXX also add textLength? it seems to be widely used -->

  <p>These methods and attributes expose and control the selection of
  <code>input</code> and <code>textarea</code> text fields.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea/input-select"><code>select()</code></dfn> method
  must cause the contents of the text field to be fully selected.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea/input-selectionStart"><code>selectionStart</code></dfn>
  attribute must, on getting, return the offset (in logical order) to
  the character that immediately follows the start of the
  selection. If there is no selection, then it must return the offset
  (in logical order) to the character that immediately follows the
  text entry cursor.</p>

  <p>On setting, it must act as if the <code
  title="dom-textarea/input-setSelectionRange">setSelectionRange()</code>
  method had been called, with the new value as the first argument,
  and the current value of the <code
  title="dom-textarea/input-selectionEnd">selectionEnd</code>
  attribute as the second argument, unless the current value of the
  <code title="dom-textarea/input-selectionEnd">selectionEnd</code> is
  less than the new value, in which case the second argument must also
  be the new value.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea/input-selectionEnd"><code>selectionEnd</code></dfn>
  attribute must, on getting, return the offset (in logical order) to
  the character that immediately follows the end of the selection. If
  there is no selection, then it must return the offset (in logical
  order) to the character that immediately follows the text entry
  cursor.</p>

  <p>On setting, it must act as if the <code
  title="dom-textarea/input-setSelectionRange">setSelectionRange()</code>
  method had been called, with the current value of the <code
  title="dom-textarea/input-selectionStart">selectionStart</code>
  attribute as the first argument, and new value as the second
  argument.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-textarea/input-setSelectionRange"><code>setSelectionRange(<var
  title="">start</var>, <var title="">end</var>)</code></dfn> method
  must set the selection of the text field to the sequence of
  characters starting with the character at the <var
  title="">start</var>th position (in logical order) and ending with
  the character at the <span>(<var title="">end</var>-1)</span>th
  position. Arguments greater than the length of the value in the text
  field must be treated as pointing at the end of the text field. If
  <var title="">end</var> is less than or equal to <var
  title="">start</var> then the start of the selection and the end of
  the selection must both be placed immediately before the character
  with offset <var title="">end</var>. In UAs where there is no
  concept of an empty selection, this must set the cursor to be just
  before the character with offset <var title="">end</var>.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>To obtain the currently selected text, the following JavaScript
   suffices:</p>

   <pre>var selectionText = control.value.substring(control.selectionStart, control.selectionEnd);</pre>

   <p>...where <var title="">control</var> is the <code>input</code>
   or <code>textarea</code> element.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Characters with no visible rendering, such as U+200D ZERO WIDTH
  JOINER, still count as characters. Thus, for instance, the selection
  can include just an invisible character, and the text insertion
  cursor can be placed to one side or another of such a character.</p>

  <p>When these methods and attributes are used with
  <code>input</code> elements that are not displaying simple text
  fields, they must raise an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>




  <h3 id="contenteditable">The <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute</h3>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="attr-contenteditable"><code>contenteditable</code></dfn>
  attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span> whose keywords are
  the empty string, <code title="">true</code>, and <code
  title="">false</code>. The empty string and the <code
  title="">true</code> keyword map to the <i>true</i> state. The <code
  title="">false</code> keyword maps to the <i>false</i> state. In
  addition, there is a third state, the <i>inherit</i> state, which is
  the <i>missing value default</i> (and the <i>invalid value
  default</i>).</p>

  <p>If an <span title="HTML elements">HTML element</span> has a <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set to
  the true state, or it has its <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set to
  the inherit state and if its nearest ancestor <span title="HTML
  elements">HTML element</span> with the <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set to
  a state other than the inherit state has its attribute set to the
  true state, or if it and its ancestors all have their <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set to
  the inherit state but the <code>Document</code> has <code
  title="dom-document-designMode">designMode</code> enabled, then the
  UA must treat the element as <dfn>editable</dfn> (as described
  below).</p>

  <p>Otherwise, either the <span title="HTML elements">HTML
  element</span> has a <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set to
  the false state, or its <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute is set
  to the inherit state and its nearest ancestor <span title="HTML
  elements">HTML element</span> with the <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set to
  a state other than the inherit state has its attribute set to the
  false state, or all its ancestors have their <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute set to
  the inherit state and the <code>Document</code> itself has <code
  title="dom-document-designMode">designMode</code> disabled; either
  way, the element is not editable.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-contentEditable"><code>contentEditable</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, on getting, must return the string "<code
  title="">true</code>" if the content attribute is set to the true
  state, <code title="">false</code>" if the content attribute is set
  to the false state, and "<code title="">inherit</code>"
  otherwise. On setting, if the new value is an <span>ASCII
  case-insensitive</span> match for the string "<code
  title="">inherit</code>" then the content attribute must be removed,
  if the new value is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for
  the string "<code title="">true</code>" then the content attribute
  must be set to the string "<code title="">true</code>", if the new
  value is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the string
  "<code title="">false</code>" then the content attribute must be set
  to the string "<code title="">false</code>", and otherwise the
  attribute setter must raise a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-isContentEditable"><code>isContentEditable</code></dfn>
  DOM attribute, on getting, must return true if the element is
  <span>editable</span>, and false otherwise.</p>

  <p>If an element is <span>editable</span> and its parent element is
  not, or if an element is <span>editable</span> and it has no parent
  element, then the element is an <dfn>editing host</dfn>. Editable
  elements can be nested. User agents must make editing hosts
  focusable (which typically means they enter the <span
  title="attr-tabindex">tab order</span>). An editing host can contain
  non-editable sections, these are handled as described below. An
  editing host can contain non-editable sections that contain further
  editing hosts.</p>

  <p>When an editing host has focus, it must have a <dfn>caret
  position</dfn> that specifies where the current editing position
  is. It may also have a <span title="the
  selection">selection</span>.</p> <!-- XXX xref to later section -->

  <p class="note">How the caret and selection are represented depends
  entirely on the UA.</p>

  <!-- XXX rendering requirement: The current caret should affect the
  line-height (i.e. it acts at least like an empty inline element) -->

  <!-- XXX would be useful to have a way to mark an element as
  unremovable. -->


  <h4>User editing actions</h4>

  <p>There are several actions that the user agent should allow the
  user to perform while the user is interacting with an editing
  host. How exactly each action is triggered is not defined for every
  action, but when it is not defined, suggested key bindings are
  provided to guide implementors.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Move the caret</dt>

   <dd><p>User agents must allow users to move the caret to any
   position within an editing host, even into nested editable
   elements. This could be triggered as the default action of <code
   title="event-keydown">keydown</code> events with various key
   identifiers and as the default action of <code
   title="event-mousedown">mousedown</code> events.</p></dd>


   <dt>Change the selection</dt>

   <dd><p>User agents must allow users to change <span>the
   selection</span> within an editing host, even into nested editable
   elements. User agents may prevent selections from being made in
   ways that cross from editable elements into non-editable elements
   (e.g. by making each non-editable descendant atomically selectable,
   but not allowing text selection within them). This could be
   triggered as the default action of <code
   title="event-keydown">keydown</code> events with various key
   identifiers and as the default action of <code
   title="event-mousedown">mousedown</code> events.</p></dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-insertText">Insert text</dt>

   <dd><p>This action must be triggered as the default action of a
   <code title="event-textInput">textInput</code> event, and may be
   triggered by other commands as well. It must cause the user agent
   to insert the specified text (given by the event object's <code
   title="">data</code> attribute in the case of the <code
   title="event-textInput">textInput</code> event) at the caret.</p>

   <p>If the caret is positioned somewhere where <span>phrasing
   content</span> is not allowed (e.g. inside an empty <code>ol</code>
   element), then the user agent must not insert the text directly at
   the caret position. In such cases the behavior is UA-dependent,
   but user agents must not, in response to a request to insert text,
   generate a DOM that is less conformant than the DOM prior to the
   request.</p>

   <p>User agents should allow users to insert new paragraphs into
   elements that contains only content other than paragraphs.</p>

   <div class="example">
    <p>For example, given the markup:</p>
    <pre>&lt;section&gt;
 &lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt; Ben &lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt; Goat &lt;/dd&gt;
 &lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>
    <p>...the user agent should allow the user to insert
    <code>p</code> elements before and after the <code>dl</code>
    element, as children of the <code>section</code> element.</p>
   </div>

   </dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-breakBlock">Break block</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer a way for the user to request that the
   current paragraph be broken at the caret, e.g. as the default
   action of a <code title="event-keydown">keydown</code> event whose
   identifier is the "Enter" key and that has no modifiers set.</p>

   <p>The exact behavior is UA-dependent, but user agents must not,
   in response to a request to break a paragraph, generate a DOM that
   is less conformant than the DOM prior to the request.</p></dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-br">Insert a line separator</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer a way for the user to request an explicit
   line break at the caret position without breaking the paragraph,
   e.g. as the default action of a <code
   title="event-keydown">keydown</code> event whose identifier is the
   "Enter" key and that has a shift modifier set. Line separators are
   typically found within a poem verse or an address. To insert a line
   break, the user agent must insert a <code>br</code> element.</p>

   <p>If the caret is positioned somewhere where <span>phrasing
   content</span> is not allowed (e.g. in an empty <code>ol</code>
   element), then the user agent must not insert the <code>br</code>
   element directly at the caret position. In such cases the behavior
   is UA-dependent, but user agents must not, in response to a request
   to insert a line separator, generate a DOM that is less conformant
   than the DOM prior to the request.</p></dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-delete">Delete</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer a way for the user to delete text and
   elements, including non-editable descendants, e.g. as the default
   action of <code title="event-keydown">keydown</code> events whose
   identifiers are "U+0008" or "U+007F".</p>

   <p>Five edge cases in particular need to be considered carefully
   when implementing this feature: backspacing at the start of an
   element, backspacing when the caret is immediately after an
   element, forward-deleting at the end of an element,
   forward-deleting when the caret is immediately before an element,
   and deleting a <span title="the selection">selection</span> whose
   start and end points do not share a common parent node.</p>

   <p>In any case, the exact behavior is UA-dependent, but user
   agents must not, in response to a request to delete text or an
   element, generate a DOM that is less conformant than the DOM prior
   to the request.</p></dd>


   <dt id="contenteditable-wrapSemantic">Insert, and wrap text in,
   semantic elements</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer the user the ability to mark text and
   paragraphs with semantics that HTML can express.</p>

   <p>UAs should similarly offer a way for the user to insert empty
   semantic elements to subsequently fill by entering text
   manually.</p>

   <p>UAs should also offer a way to remove those semantics from
   marked up text, and to remove empty semantic element that have been
   inserted.</p>

   <p>In response to a request from a user to mark text up in italics,
   user agents should use the <code>i</code> element to represent the
   semantic. The <code>em</code> element should be used only if the
   user agent is sure that the user means to indicate stress
   emphasis.</p>

   <p>In response to a request from a user to mark text up in bold,
   user agents should use the <code>b</code> element to represent the
   semantic. The <code>strong</code> element should be used only if
   the user agent is sure that the user means to indicate
   importance.</p>

   <p>The exact behavior is UA-dependent, but user agents must not,
   in response to a request to wrap semantics around some text or to
   insert or remove a semantic element, generate a DOM that is less
   conformant than the DOM prior to the request.</p></dd>


   <dt>Select and move non-editable elements nested inside editing hosts</dt>

   <dd><p>UAs should offer a way for the user to move images and other
   non-editable parts around the content within an editing host. This
   may be done using the <span>drag and drop</span> mechanism. User
   agents must not, in response to a request to move non-editable
   elements nested inside editing hosts, generate a DOM that is less
   conformant than the DOM prior to the request.</p></dd>


   <dt>Edit form controls nested inside editing hosts</dt>

   <dd><p>When an <span>editable</span> form control is edited, the
   changes must be reflected in both its current value <em>and</em>
   its default value. For <code>input</code> elements this means
   updating the <code
   title="dom-input-defaultValue">defaultValue</code> DOM attribute as
   well as the <code title="dom-input-value">value</code> DOM
   attribute; for <code>select</code> elements it means updating the
   <code>option</code> elements' <code
   title="dom-option-defaultSelected">defaultSelected</code> DOM
   attribute as well as the <code
   title="dom-option-selected">selected</code> DOM attribute; for
   <code>textarea</code> elements this means updating the <code
   title="dom-textarea-defaultValue">defaultValue</code> DOM attribute
   as well as the <code title="dom-textarea-value">value</code> DOM
   attribute. (Updating the <code title="">default*</code> DOM
   attributes causes content attributes to be updated as well.)</p></dd>

   <!-- XXX something about not supporting resizing? -->

  </dl>

  <!-- XXX each action performed should be added to the undo history -->

  <p>User agents may perform several commands per user request; for
  example if the user selects a block of text and hits
  <kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd>, the UA might interpret that as a
  request to delete the content of <span>the selection</span> followed
  by a request to break the paragraph at that position.</p>


  <h4>Making entire documents editable</h4>

  <p>Documents have a <dfn id="designMode"
  title="dom-document-designMode"><code>designMode</code></dfn>, which
  can be either enabled or disabled.</p>

  <p>The <code title="dom-document-designMode">designMode</code> DOM
  attribute on the <code>Document</code> object takes two values,
  "<code title="">on</code>" and "<code title="">off</code>". When it
  is set, the new value must be compared in an <span>ASCII
  case-insensitive</span> manner to these two values. If it matches
  the "<code title="">on</code>" value, then <code
  title="dom-document-designMode">designMode</code> must be enabled,
  and if it matches the "<code title="">off</code>" value, then <code
  title="dom-document-designMode">designMode</code> must be
  disabled. Other values must be ignored.</p>

  <p>When <code title="dom-document-designMode">designMode</code> is
  enabled, the DOM attribute must return the value "<code
  title="">on</code>", and when it is disabled, it must return the
  value "<code title="">off</code>".</p>

  <p>The last state set must persist until the document is destroyed
  or the state is changed. Initially, documents must have their <code
  title="dom-document-designMode">designMode</code> disabled.</p>

<!-- XXX does designMode disable scripting or not?
  <p>Enabling <code title="dom-document-designMode">designMode</code>
  <a href="#designModeScriptBlocked">causes scripts in general to be
  disabled</a> and the document to become editable.</p>
-->



  <h3>Spelling and grammar checking</h3>

  <p>User agents can support the checking of spelling and grammar of
  editable text, either in form controls (such as the value of
  <code>textarea</code> elements), or in elements in an <span>editing
  host</span> (using <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code>).</p>

  <p>For each element, user agents must establish a <dfn
  title="concept-spellcheck-default">default behavior</dfn>, either
  through defaults or through preferences expressed by the user. There
  are three possible default behaviors for each element:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="concept-spellcheck-default-true">true-by-default</dfn>

   <dd>The element will be checked for spelling and grammar if its
   contents are editable.

   <dt><dfn title="concept-spellcheck-default-false">false-by-default</dfn>

   <dd>The element will never be checked for spelling and grammar.

   <dt><dfn title="concept-spellcheck-default-inherit">inherit-by-default</dfn>

   <dd>The element's default behavior is the same asits parent
   element's. Elements that have no parent element cannot have this as
   their default behavior.

  </dl>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="attr-spellcheck"><code>spellcheck</code></dfn>
  attribute is an <span>enumerated attribute</span> whose keywords are
  <code title="">true</code> and <code
  title="">false</code>. The <code
  title="">true</code> keyword map to the <i>true</i> state. The <code
  title="">false</code> keyword maps to the <i>false</i> state. In
  addition, there is a third state, the <i>inherit</i> state, which is
  the <i>missing value default</i> (and the <i>invalid value
  default</i>).</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-spellcheck"><code>spellcheck</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, on getting, must return true if the element's <code
  title="attr-spellcheck">spellcheck</code> content attribute is in
  the <i>true</i> state, or if the element's <code
  title="attr-spellcheck">spellcheck</code> content attribute is in
  the <i>inherit</i> state and the element's <span
  title="concept-spellcheck-default">default behavior</span> is <span
  title="concept-spellcheck-default-true">true-by-default</span>, or
  if the element's <code title="attr-spellcheck">spellcheck</code>
  content attribute is in the <i>inherit</i> state and the element's
  <span title="concept-spellcheck-default">default behavior</span> is
  <span
  title="concept-spellcheck-default-inherit">inherit-by-default</span>
  and the element's parent element's <code
  title="dom-spellcheck">spellcheck</code> DOM attribute would return
  true; otherwise, if none of those conditions applies, then the
  attribute must instead return false.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code title="dom-spellcheck">spellcheck</code>
  DOM attribute is not affected by user preferences that override the
  <code title="attr-spellcheck">spellcheck</code> content attribute,
  and therefore might not reflect the actual spellchecking state.</p>

  <p>On setting, if the new value is true, then the element's <code
  title="attr-spellcheck">spellcheck</code> content attribute must be
  set to the literal string "<code title="">true</code>", otherwise it
  must be set to the literal string "<code title="">false</code>".

  <hr>

  <p>User agents must only consider the following pieces of text as
  checkable for the purposes of this feature:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The value of <code>input</code> elements to which the <code
   title="attr-input-readonly">readonly</code> attribute applies, but
   that are not <i title="concept-input-immutable">immutable</i>
   (i.e. that do not have the <code
   title="attr-input-readonly">readonly</code> attribute specified and
   that are not <span
   title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>).</li>

   <li>The value of <code>textarea</code> elements that do not have a
   <code title="attr-textarea-readonly">readonly</code> attribute and
   that are not <span
   title="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>.</li>

   <li>Text in <span title="text node">text nodes</span> that are
   children of <span>editable</span> elements.</li>

   <li>Text in attributes of <span>editable</span> elements.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>For text that is part of a <span>text node</span>, the element
  with which the text is associated is the element that is the
  immediate parent of the first character of the word, sentence, or
  other piece of text. For text in attributes, it is the attribute's
  element. For the values of <code>input</code> and
  <code>textarea</code> elements, it is the element itself.</p>

  <p>To determine if a word, sentence, or other piece of text in an
  applicable element (as defined above) is to have spelling- and/or
  grammar-checking enabled, the UA must use the following
  algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <!-- user override -->

   <li>If the user has disabled the checking for this text, then the
   checking is disabled.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the user has forced the checking for this text to
   always be enabled, then the checking is enabled.</li>

   <!-- content attribute: on, off -->

   <li>Otherwise, if the element with which the text is associated has
   a <code title="attr-spellcheck">spellcheck</code> content
   attribute, then: if that attribute is in the <i>true</i> state,
   then checking is enabled; otherwise, if that attribute is in the
   <i>false</i> state, then checking is disabled.</li>

   <!-- inherit, if there is one to inherit from -->

   <li>Otherwise, if there is an ancestor element with a <code
   title="attr-spellcheck">spellcheck</code> content attribute that is
   not in the <i>inherit</i> state, then: if the nearest such
   ancestor's <code title="attr-spellcheck">spellcheck</code> content
   attribute is in the <i>true</i> state, then checking is enabled;
   otherwise, checking is disabled.</li>

   <!-- default -->

   <li>Otherwise, if the element's <span
   title="concept-spellcheck-default">default behavior</span> is <span
   title="concept-spellcheck-default-true">true-by-default</span>,
   then checking is enabled.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, if the element's <span
   title="concept-spellcheck-default">default behavior</span> is <span
   title="concept-spellcheck-default-false">false-by-default</span>,
   then checking is disabled.</li>

   <!-- default inheritance -->

   <li>Otherwise, if the element's parent element has <em>its</em>
   checking enabled, then checking is enabled.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, checking is disabled.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>If the checking is enabled for a word/sentence/text, the user
  agent should indicate spelling and/or grammar errors in that
  text. User agents should take into account the other semantics given
  in the document when suggesting spelling and grammar
  corrections. User agents may use the language of the element to
  determine what spelling and grammar rules to use, or may use the
  user's preferred language settings. UAs should use
  <code>input</code> element attributes such as <code
  title="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code> to ensure that the
  resulting value is valid, where possible.</p>

  <p>If checking is disabled, the user agent should not indicate
  spelling or grammar errors for that text.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The element with ID "a" in the following example would be the
   one used to determine if the word "Hello" is checked for spelling
   errors. In this example, it would not be.</p>

   <pre>&lt;div contenteditable="true">
 &lt;span spellcheck="false" id="a">Hell&lt;/span>&lt;em>o!&lt;/em>
&lt;/div></pre>

   <p>The element with ID "b" in the following example would have
   checking enabled (the leading space character in the attribute's
   value on the <code>input</code> element causes the attribute to be
   ignored, so the ancestor's value is used instead, regardless of the
   default).</p>

   <pre>&lt;p spellcheck="true">
 &lt;label>Name: &lt;input spellcheck=" false" id="b">&lt;/label>
&lt;/p></pre>

   </div>

  <p>This section defines an event-based drag-and-drop mechanism.</p>

  <p>This specification does not define exactly what a
  <em>drag-and-drop operation</em> actually is.</p>

  <p>On a visual medium with a pointing device, a drag operation could
  be the default action of a <code
  title="event-mousedown">mousedown</code> event that is followed by a
  series of <code title="event-mousemove">mousemove</code> events, and
  the drop could be triggered by the mouse being released.</p>

  <p>On media without a pointing device, the user would probably have
  to explicitly indicate his intention to perform a drag-and-drop
  operation, stating what he wishes to drag and what he wishes to
  drop, respectively.</p>

  <p>However it is implemented, drag-and-drop operations must have a
  starting point (e.g. where the mouse was clicked, or the start of
  <span>the selection</span> or element that was selected for the
  drag), may have any number of intermediate steps (elements that the
  mouse moves over during a drag, or elements that the user picks as
  possible drop points as he cycles through possibilities), and must
  either have an end point (the element above which the mouse button
  was released, or the element that was finally selected), or be
  canceled. The end point must be the last element selected as a
  possible drop point before the drop occurs (so if the operation is
  not canceled, there must be at least one element in the middle
  step).</p>


  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p class="XXX">It's also currently non-existent.</p>


  <h4>The <code>DragEvent</code> and <code>DataTransfer</code> interfaces</h4>

  <p>The drag-and-drop processing model involves several events. They
  all use the <code>DragEvent</code> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>DragEvent</dfn> : MouseEvent {
  readonly attribute <span>DataTransfer</span> <span title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</span>;

  void <span title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEvent">initDragEvent</span>(in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in AbstractView viewArg, in long detailArg, in long screenXArg, in long screenYArg, in long clientXArg, in long clientYArg, in boolean ctrlKeyArg, in boolean altKeyArg, in boolean shiftKeyArg, in boolean metaKeyArg, in unsigned short buttonArg, in EventTarget relatedTargetArg, in <span>DataTransfer</span> dataTransferArg);
  void <span title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEventNS">initDragEventNS</span>(in DOMString namespaceURIArg, in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in AbstractView viewArg, in long detailArg, in long screenXArg, in long screenYArg, in long clientXArg, in long clientYArg, in unsigned short buttonArg, in EventTarget relatedTargetArg, in DOMString modifiersListArg, in <span>DataTransfer</span> dataTransferArg);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEvent"><code>initDragEvent()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn
  title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEventNS"><code>initDragEventNS()</code></dfn>
  methods must initialize the event in a manner analogous to the
  similarly-named methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a
  href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p class="note">The <code
  title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEvent">initDragEvent()</code> and <code
  title="dom-DragEvent-initDragEventNS">initDragEventNS()</code>
  methods handle modifier keys differently, much like the equivalent
  methods on the <code>MouseEvent</code> interface.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer"><code>dataTransfer</code></dfn>
  attribute of the <code>DragEvent</code> interface represents the
  context information for the event.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>DataTransfer</dfn> {
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</span>;
           attribute DOMString <span title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed">effectAllowed</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMStringList <span title="dom-DataTransfer-types">types</span>;
  void <span title="dom-DataTransfer-clearData">clearData</span>([Optional] in DOMString format);
  void <span title="dom-DataTransfer-setData">setData</span>(in DOMString format, in DOMString data);
  DOMString <span title="dom-DataTransfer-getData">getData</span>(in DOMString format);
  void <span title="dom-DataTransfer-setDragImage">setDragImage</span>(in Element image, in long x, in long y);
  void <span title="dom-DataTransfer-addElement">addElement</span>(in Element element);
};
</pre>

  <p><code>DataTransfer</code> objects can conceptually contain
  various kinds of data.</p>

  <p>When a <code>DataTransfer</code> object is created, it must be
  initialized as follows:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The <code>DataTransfer</code> object must initially contain no
   data, no elements, and have no associated image.</li>

   <li>The <code>DataTransfer</code> object's <code
   title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed">effectAllowed</code>
   attribute must be set to "<code
   title="">uninitialized</code>".</li>

   <li>The <code title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code>
   attribute must be set to "<code title="">none</code>".</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect"><code>dropEffect</code></dfn>
  attribute controls the drag-and-drop feedback that the user is given
  during a drag-and-drop operation.</p>

  <p>The attribute must ignore any attempts to set it to a value other
  than <code title="">none</code>, <code title="">copy</code>, <code
  title="">link</code>, and <code title="">move</code>. On getting,
  the attribute must return the last of those four values that it was
  set to.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed"><code>effectAllowed</code></dfn>
  attribute is used in the drag-and-drop processing model to
  initialize the <code
  title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code> attribute
  during the <code title="event-dragenter">dragenter</code> and <code
  title="event-dragover">dragover</code> events.</p>

  <p>The attribute must ignore any attempts to set it to a value other
  than <code title="">none</code>, <code title="">copy</code>, <code
  title="">copyLink</code>, <code title="">copyMove</code>, <code
  title="">link</code>, <code title="">linkMove</code>, <code
  title="">move</code>, <code title="">all</code>, and <code
  title="">uninitialized</code>. On getting, the attribute must return
  the last of those values that it was set to.</p>

  <p><code>DataTransfer</code> objects can hold pieces of data, each
  associated with a unique format. Formats are generally given by MIME
  types, with some values special-cased for legacy reasons. For the
  purposes of this API, however, the format strings are opaque,
  <span>case-sensitive</span>, strings, and the empty string is a
  valid format string.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataTransfer-clearData"><code>clearData()</code></dfn>
  method, when called with no arguments, must clear the
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object of al data (for all formats).</p>

  <p>When called with an argument, the <code
  title="dom-DataTransfer-clearData">clearData(<var
  title="">format</var>)</code> method must clear the
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object of any data associated with the
  given <var title="">format</var>. If <var title="">format</var> is
  the value "<code title="">Text</code>", then it must be treated as
  "<code title="">text/plain</code>". If the <var
  title="">format</var> is "<code title="">URL</code>", then it must
  be treated as "<code title="">text/uri-list</code>".</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-DataTransfer-setData"><code>setData(<var
  title="">format</var>, <var title="">data</var>)</code></dfn> method
  must add <var title="">data</var> to the data stored in the
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object, labeled as being of the type <var
  title="">format</var>. This must replace any previous data that had
  been set for that format. If <var title="">format</var> is the value
  "<code title="">Text</code>", then it must be treated as "<code
  title="">text/plain</code>". If the <var title="">format</var> is
  "<code title="">URL</code>", then it must be treated as "<code
  title="">text/uri-list</code>".</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-DataTransfer-getData"><code>getData(<var
  title="">format</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the data that
  is associated with the type <var title="">format</var>, if any, and
  must return the empty string otherwise. If <var
  title="">format</var> is the value "<code title="">Text</code>",
  then it must be treated as "<code title="">text/plain</code>". If
  the <var title="">format</var> is "<code title="">URL</code>", then
  the data associated with the "<code title="">text/uri-list</code>"
  format must be parsed as appropriate for <code
  title="">text/uri-list</code> data, and the first URL from the list
  must be returned. If there is no data with that format, or if there
  is but it has no URLs, then the method must return the empty
  string. <a href="#refsRFC2483">[RFC2483]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-DataTransfer-types"><code>types</code></dfn>
  attribute must return a live <code>DOMStringList</code> that
  contains the list of formats that are stored in the
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataTransfer-setDragImage"><code>setDragImage(<var
  title="">element</var>, <var title="">x</var>, <var
  title="">y</var>)</code></dfn> method sets which element to use <a
  href="#base-dnd-feedback">to generate the drag feedback</a>. The
  <var title="">element</var> argument can be any
  <code>Element</code>; if it is an <code>img</code> element, then the
  user agent should use the element's image (at its intrinsic size) to
  generate the feedback, otherwise the user agent should base the
  feedback on the given element (but the exact mechanism for doing so
  is not specified).</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-DataTransfer-addElement"><code>addElement(<var
  title="">element</var>)</code></dfn> method is an alternative way of
  specifying how the user agent is to <a
  href="#base-dnd-feedback">render the drag feedback</a>. It adds an
  element to the <code>DataTransfer</code> object.</p>

  <p class="note">The difference between <code
  title="dom-DataTransfer-setDragImage">setDragImage()</code> and
  <code title="dom-DataTransfer-addElement">addElement()</code> is
  that the latter automatically generates the image based on the
  current rendering of the elements added, whereas the former uses the
  exact specified image.</p>


  <h4>Events fired during a drag-and-drop action</h4>

  <p>The following events are involved in the drag-and-drop
  model. Whenever the processing model described below causes one of
  these events to be fired, the event fired must use the
  <code>DragEvent</code> interface defined above, must have the
  bubbling and cancelable behaviors given in the table below, and must
  have the context information set up as described after the table,
  with the <code title="dom-UIEvent-view">view</code> attribute set to
  the view with which the user interacted to trigger the drag-and-drop
  event, the <code title="dom-UIEvent-detail">detail</code> attribute
  set to zero, the mouse and key attributes set according to the state
  of the input devices as they would be for user interaction events,
  and the <code title="">relatedTarget</code> attribute set to
  null.</p>

  <h4>Drag-and-drop processing model</h4>

  <p>When the user attempts to begin a drag operation, the user agent
  must first determine what is being dragged. If the drag operation
  was invoked on a selection, then it is the selection that is being
  dragged. Otherwise, it is the first element, going up the ancestor
  chain, starting at the node that the user tried to drag, that has
  the DOM attribute <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> set
  to true. If there is no such element, then nothing is being dragged,
  the drag-and-drop operation is never started, and the user agent
  must not continue with this algorithm.</p>

  <p class="note"><code>img</code> elements and <code>a</code>
  elements with an <code title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code>
  attribute have their <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code>
  attribute set to true by default.</p>

  <p>If the user agent determines that something can be dragged, a
  <code title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event must then be
  fired.</p>

  <p>If it is a selection that is being dragged, then this event must
  be fired on the node that the user started the drag on (typically
  the text node that the user originally clicked). If the user did not
  specify a particular node, for example if the user just told the
  user agent to begin a drag of "the selection", then the event must
  be fired on the deepest node that is a common ancestor of all parts
  of the selection.</p>

  <p class="XXX">We should look into how browsers do other types
  (e.g. Firefox apparently also adds text/html for internal drag and
  drop of a selection).</p>

  <p>If it is not a selection that is being dragged, then the event
  must be fired on the element that is being dragged.</p>

  <p>The node on which the event is fired is the <dfn>source
  node</dfn>. Multiple events are fired on this node during the course
  of the drag-and-drop operation.</p>

  <p>If it is a selection that is being dragged, the <code
  title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> member of the event
  must be created with no nodes. Otherwise, it must be created
  containing just the <span>source node</span>. Script can use the
  <code title="dom-DataTransfer-addElement">addElement()</code> method
  to add further elements to the list of what is being dragged.</p>

  <p>If it is a selection that is being dragged, the <code
  title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> member of the
  event must have the text of the selection added to it as the data
  associated with the <code title="">text/plain</code>
  format. Otherwise, if it is an <code>img</code> element being
  dragged, then the value of the element's <code
  title="dom-img-src">src</code> DOM attribute must be added,
  associated with the <code title="">text/uri-list</code>
  format. Otherwise, if it is an <code>a</code> element being dragged,
  then the value of the element's <code title="dom-a-href">href</code>
  DOM attribute must be added, associated with the <code
  title="">text/uri-list</code> format. Otherwise, no data is added to
  the object by the user agent.</p>

  <p>If the event is canceled, then the drag-and-drop operation must
  not occur; the user agent must not continue with this algorithm.</p>

  <p>If it is not canceled, then the drag-and-drop operation must be
  initiated.</p>

  <p class="note">Since events with no event handlers registered are,
  almost by definition, never canceled, drag-and-drop is always
  available to the user if the author does not specifically prevent
  it.</p>

  <p id="base-dnd-feedback">The drag-and-drop feedback must be
  generated from the first of the following sources that is
  available:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>The element specified in the last call to the <code
   title="dom-DataTransfer-setDragImage">setDragImage()</code> method
   of the <code title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code>
   object of the <code title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event,
   if the method was called. In visual media, if this is used, the
   <var title="">x</var> and <var title="">y</var> arguments that were
   passed to that method should be used as hints for where to put the
   cursor relative to the resulting image. The values are expressed as
   distances in CSS pixels from the left side and from the top side of
   the image respectively. <a href="#refsCSS21">[CSS21]</a></li> <!--
   CSS3 UNITS would be better -->

   <li>The elements that were added to the <code
   title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object, both
   before the event was fired, and during the handling of the event
   using the <code
   title="dom-DataTransfer-addElement">addElement()</code>
   method, if any such elements were indeed added.</li>

   <li>The selection that the user is dragging.</li>

  </ol><!-- XXX xref also link to the section that explains how to
  render drag-and-drop, :drag, :drop, etc. Safari has a pseudo-class
  that it uses to render an element off-screen to use as the drag
  feedback. -->

  <p>The user agent must take a note of <span
  title="dom-DataTransfer-setData">the data that was placed</span> in
  the <code title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code>
  object. This data will be made available again when the <code
  title="event-drop">drop</code> event is fired.</p>

  <p>From this point until the end of the drag-and-drop operation,
  device input events (e.g. mouse and keyboard events) must be
  suppressed. In addition, the user agent must track all DOM changes
  made during the drag-and-drop operation, and add them to its <a
  href="#undo">undo history</a> as one atomic operation once the
  drag-and-drop operation has ended.</p>

  <p>During the drag operation, the element directly indicated by the
  user as the drop target is called the <dfn>immediate user
  selection</dfn>. (Only elements can be selected by the user; other
  nodes must not be made available as drop targets.)

  However, the <span>immediate user selection</span> is not
  necessarily the <dfn>current target element</dfn>, which is the
  element currently selected for the drop part of the drag-and-drop
  operation.

  The <span>immediate user selection</span> changes as the user
  selects different elements (either by pointing at them with a
  pointing device, or by selecting them in some other way). The
  <span>current target element</span> changes when the <span>immediate
  user selection</span> changes, based on the results of event
  handlers in the document, as described below.</p>

  <p>Both the <span>current target element</span> and the
  <span>immediate user selection</span> can be null, which means no
  target element is selected. They can also both be elements in other
  (DOM-based) documents, or other (non-Web) programs altogether. (For
  example, a user could drag text to a word-processor.) The
  <span>current target element</span> is initially null.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is also a <dfn>current drag operation</dfn>,
  which can take on the values "none", "copy", "link", and "move".
  Initially it has the value "none". It is updated by the user agent
  as described in the steps below.</p>

  <p>User agents must, every 350ms (&#xB1;200ms), perform the
  following steps in sequence. (If the user agent is still performing
  the previous iteration of the sequence when the next iteration
  becomes due, the user agent must not execute the overdue iteration,
  effectively "skipping missed frames" of the drag-and-drop
  operation.)</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>First, the user agent must fire a <code
    title="event-drag">drag</code> event at the <span>source
    node</span>. If this event is canceled, the user agent must set
    the <span>current drag operation</span> to none (no drag
    operation).</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Next, if the <code title="event-drag">drag</code> event was not
    canceled and the user has not ended the drag-and-drop operation,
    the user agent must check the state of the drag-and-drop
    operation, as follows:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>

      <p>First, if the user is indicating a different <span>immediate
      user selection</span> than during the last iteration (or if this
      is the first iteration), and if this <span>immediate user
      selection</span> is not the same as the <span>current target
      element</span>, then the <span>current target element</span> must
      be updated, as follows:</p>

      <ol>

       <li>

        <p>If the new <span>immediate user selection</span> is null, or
        is in a non-DOM document or application, then set the
        <span>current target element</span> to the same value.</p>

       <li>

        <p>Otherwise, the user agent must fire a <code
        title="event-dragenter">dragenter</code> event at the
        <span>immediate user selection</span>.</p>

       </li>

       <li>

        <p>If the event is canceled, then the <span>current target
        element</span> must be set to the <span>immediate user
        selection</span>.</p>

       </li>

       <li>

        <p>Otherwise, if the <span>current target element</span> is
        not <span>the body element</span>, the user agent must fire a
        <code title="event-dragenter">dragenter</code> event at
        <span>the body element</span>, and the <span>current target
        element</span> must be set to <span>the body element</span>,
        regardless of whether that event was canceled or not. (If
        <span>the body element</span> is null, then the <span>current
        target element</span> would be set to null too in this case,
        it wouldn't be set to the <code>Document</code> object.)</p>

       </li>

      </ol>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>If the previous step caused the <span>current target
      element</span> to change, and if the previous target element was
      not null or a part of a non-DOM document, the user agent must fire
      a <code title="event-dragleave">dragleave</code> event at the
      previous target element.</p>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>If the <span>current target element</span> is a DOM element,
      the user agent must fire a <code
      title="event-dragover">dragover</code> event at this <span>current
      target element</span>.</p>

      <p>If the <code title="event-dragover">dragover</code> event is
      not canceled, the <span>current drag operation</span> must be
      reset to "none".</p>

      <p>Otherwise, the <span>current drag operation</span> must be
      set based on the values the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed">effectAllowed</code> and
      <code title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code>
      attributes of the <code
      title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object
      had after the event was handled, as per the following table:</p>

      <table>
       <thead>
        <tr>
         <th><code title="dom-DataTransfer-effectAllowed">effectAllowed</code></th>
         <th><code title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code></th>
         <th>Drag operation</th>
        </tr>
       </thead>
       <tr>
        <td><code title="">uninitialized</code>, <code title="">copy</code>, <code title="">copyLink</code>, <code title="">copyMove</code>, or <code title="">all</code></td>
        <td><code title="">copy</code></td>
        <td>"copy"</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td><code title="">uninitialized</code>, <code title="">link</code>, <code title="">copyLink</code>, <code title="">linkMove</code>, or <code title="">all</code></td>
        <td><code title="">link</code></td>
        <td>"link"</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td><code title="">uninitialized</code>, <code title="">move</code>, <code title="">copyMove</code>, <code title="">linkMove</code>, or <code title="">all</code></td>

       <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Any other case</td>
        <td>"none"</td>
       </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Then, regardless of whether the <code
      title="event-dragover">dragover</code> event was canceled or
      not, the drag feedback (e.g. the mouse cursor) must be updated
      to match the <span>current drag operation</span>, as
      follows:</p>

      <table>
       <thead>
        <tr>
         <th>Drag operation</th>
         <th>Feedback</th>
        </tr>
       </thead>
       <tr>
        <td>"copy"</td>
        <td>Data will be copied if dropped here.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>"link"</td>
        <td>Data will be linked if dropped here.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>"move"</td>
        <td>Data will be moved if dropped here.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>"none"</td>
        <td>No operation allowed, dropping here will cancel the drag-and-drop operation.</td>
       </tr>
      </table>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>Otherwise, if the <span>current target element</span> is not a
      DOM element, the user agent must use platform-specific mechanisms
      to determine what drag operation is being performed (none, copy,
      link, or move). This sets the <em>current drag operation</em>.</p>

     </li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Otherwise, if the user ended the drag-and-drop operation (e.g.
    by releasing the mouse button in a mouse-driven drag-and-drop
    interface), or if the <code title="event-drag">drag</code> event
    was canceled, then this will be the last iteration. The user agent
    must execute the following steps, then stop looping.</p>

    <ol>

     <li>

      <p>If the <span>current drag operation</span> is none (no drag
      operation), or, if the user ended the drag-and-drop operation by
      canceling it (e.g. by hitting the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key), or if
      the <span>current target element</span> is null, then the drag
      operation failed. If the <span>current target element</span> is
      a DOM element, the user agent must fire a <code
      title="event-dragleave">dragleave</code> event at it; otherwise,
      if it is not null, it must use platform-specific conventions for
      drag cancellation.</p>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>Otherwise, the drag operation was as success. If the
      <span>current target element</span> is a DOM element, the user
      agent must fire a <code title="event-drop">drop</code> event at
      it; otherwise, it must use platform-specific conventions for
      indicating a drop.</p>

      <p>When the target is a DOM element, the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code> attribute
      of the event's <code
      title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object
      must be given the value representing the <span>current drag
      operation</span> (<code title="">copy</code>, <code
      title="">link</code>, or <code title="">move</code>), and the
      object must be set up so that the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-getData">getData()</code> method will
      return the data that was added during the <code
      title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event.</p>

      <p>If the event is canceled, the <span>current drag
      operation</span> must be set to the value of the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code> attribute
      of the event's <code
      title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object as
      it stood after the event was handled.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, the event is not canceled, and the user agent must
      perform the event's default action, which depends on the exact
      target as follows:</p>

      <dl class="switch">

       <dt>If the <span>current target element</span> is a text field
       (e.g. <code>textarea</code>, or an <code>input</code> element
       whose <code title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
       the <span title="attr-input-type-text">Text</span> state)</dt>

       <dd>The user agent must insert the data associated with the
       <code>text/plain</code> format, if any, into the text field in
       a manner consistent with platform-specific conventions
       (e.g. inserting it at the current mouse cursor position, or
       inserting it at the end of the field).</dd>

       <dt>Otherwise</dt>

       <dd>Reset the <span>current drag operation</span> to
       "none".</dd>

      </dl>

     </li>

     <li>

      <p>Finally, the user agent must fire a <code
      title="event-dragend">dragend</code> event at the <span>source
      node</span>, with the <code
      title="dom-DataTransfer-dropEffect">dropEffect</code> attribute
      of the event's <code
      title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> object
      being set to the value corresponding to the <span>current drag
      operation</span>.</p>

      <p class="note">The <span>current drag operation</span> can
      change during the processing of the <code
      title="event-drop">drop</code> event, if one was fired.</p>

      <p>The event is not cancelable. After the event has been
      handled, the user agent must act as follows:</p>

      <dl class="switch">

       <dt>If the <span>current target element</span> is a text field
       (e.g. <code>textarea</code>, or an <code>input</code> element
       whose <code title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
       the <span title="attr-input-type-text">Text</span> state), and
       a <code title="event-drop">drop</code> event was fired in the
       previous step, and the <span>current drag operation</span> is
       "move", and the source of the drag-and-drop operation is a
       selection in the DOM</dt>

       <dd>The user agent should delete the range representing the
       dragged selection from the DOM.</dd>

       <dt>If the <span>current target element</span> is a text field
       (e.g. <code>textarea</code>, or an <code>input</code> element
       whose <code title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
       the <span title="attr-input-type-text">Text</span> state), and
       a <code title="event-drop">drop</code> event was fired in the
       previous step, and the <span>current drag operation</span> is
       "move", and the source of the drag-and-drop operation is a
       selection in a text field</dt>

       <dd>The user agent should delete the dragged selection from the
       relevant text field.</dd>

       <dt>Otherwise</dt>

       <dd>The event has no default action.</dd>

      </dl>

     </li>

    </ol>

   </li>

  </ol>


  <h5>When the drag-and-drop operation starts or ends in another
  document</h5>

  <p>The model described above is independent of which
  <code>Document</code> object the nodes involved are from; the events
  must be fired as described above and the rest of the processing
  model must be followed as described above, irrespective of how many
  documents are involved in the operation.</p>

  <!-- should we mention that you shouldn't include the view from the
  source in the events to the target, or is that obvious enough from
  the requirements in the event section above? -->


  <h5>When the drag-and-drop operation starts or ends in another
  application</h5>

  <p>If the drag is initiated in another application, the <span>source
  node</span> is not a DOM node, and the user agent must use
  platform-specific conventions instead when the requirements above
  involve the source node. User agents in this situation must act as
  if the dragged data had been added to the <code>DataTransfer</code>
  object when the drag started, even though no <code
  title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event was actually fired;
  user agents must similarly use platform-specific conventions when
  deciding on what drag feedback to use.</p>

  <p>If a drag is started in a document but ends in another
  application, then the user agent must instead replace the parts of
  the processing model relating to handling the <em>target</em>
  according to platform-specific conventions.</p>

  <p>In any case, scripts running in the context of the document must
  not be able to distinguish the case of a drag-and-drop operation
  being started or ended in another application from the case of a
  drag-and-drop operation being started or ended in another document

  <h4>The <dfn title="attr-draggable"><code>draggable</code></dfn> attribute</h4>

  <p>All elements may have the <code
  title="attr-draggable">draggable</code> content attribute set. The
  <code title="attr-draggable">draggable</code> attribute is an
  <span>enumerated attribute</span>. It has three states. The first
  state is <i>true</i> and it has the keyword <code
  title="">true</code>. The second state is <i>false</i> and it has
  the keyword <code title="">false</code>. The third state is
  <i>auto</i>; it has no keywords but it is the <i>missing value
  default</i>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-draggable"><code>draggable</code></dfn> DOM
  attribute, whose value depends on the content attribute's in the way
  described below, controls whether or not the element is
  draggable. Generally, only text selections are draggable, but
  elements whose <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM
  attribute is true become draggable as well.</p>

  <p>If an element's <code title="attr-draggable">draggable</code>
  content attribute has the state <i>true</i>, the <code
  title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute must return
  true.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if the element's <code
  title="attr-draggable">draggable</code> content attribute has the
  state <i>false</i>, the <code
  title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute must return
  false.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the element's <code
  title="attr-draggable">draggable</code> content attribute has the
  state <i>auto</i>. If the element is an <code>img</code> element,
  or, if the element is an <code>a</code> element with an <code
  title="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code> content attribute, the <code
  title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute must return
  true.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM
  must return false.</p>

  <p>If the <code title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute
  is set to the value false, the <code
  title="attr-draggable">draggable</code> content attribute must be
  set to the literal value <code title="">false</code>. If the <code
  title="dom-draggable">draggable</code> DOM attribute is set to the
  value true, the <code title="attr-draggable">draggable</code>
  content attribute must be set to the literal value <code
  title="">true</code>.</p>



  <h4>Copy and paste</h4>

  <p>Copy-and-paste is a form of drag-and-drop: the "copy" part is
  equivalent to dragging content to another application (the
  "clipboard"), and the "paste" part is equivalent to dragging content
  <em>from</em> another application.</p>

  <p>Select-and-paste (a model used by mouse operations in the X
  Window System) is equivalent to a drag-and-drop operation where the
  source is the selection.</p>


  <h5>Copy to clipboard</h5>

  <p>When the user invokes a copy operation, the user agent must act
  as if the user had invoked a drag on the current selection. If the
  drag-and-drop operation initiates, then the user agent must act as
  if the user had indicated (as the <span>immediate user
  selection</span>) a hypothetical application representing the
  clipboard. Then, the user agent must act as if the user had ended
  the drag-and-drop operation without canceling it. If the
  drag-and-drop operation didn't get canceled, the user agent should
  then follow the relevant platform-specific conventions for copy
  operations (e.g. updating the clipboard).</p>


  <h5>Cut to clipboard</h5>

  <p>When the user invokes a cut operation, the user agent must act as
  if the user had invoked a copy operation (see the previous section),
  followed, if the copy was completed successfully, by <a
  href="#contenteditable-delete">a selection delete operation</a>.</p>


  <h5>Paste from clipboard</h5>

  <p>When the user invokes a clipboard paste operation, the user agent
  must act as if the user had invoked a drag on a hypothetical
  application representing the clipboard, setting the data associated
  with the drag as the content on the clipboard (in whatever formats
  are available).</p>

  <p>Then, the user agent must act as if the user had indicated (as
  the <span>immediate user selection</span>) the element with the
  keyboard focus, and then ended the drag-and-drop operation without
  canceling it.</p>


  <h5>Paste from selection</h5>

  <p>When the user invokes a selection paste operation, the user agent
  must act as if the user had invoked a drag on the current selection,
  then indicated (as the <span>immediate user selection</span>) the
  element with the keyboard focus, and then ended the drag-and-drop
  operation without canceling it.</p>



  <h4>Security risks in the drag-and-drop model</h4>

  <p>User agents must not make the data added to the
  <code>DataTransfer</code> object during the <code
  title="event-dragstart">dragstart</code> event available to scripts
  until the <code title="event-drop">drop</code> event, because
  otherwise, if a user were to drag sensitive information from one
  document to a second document, crossing a hostile third document in
  the process, the hostile document could intercept the data.</p>

  <p>For the same reason, user agents must consider a drop to be
  successful only if the user specifically ended the drag operation
  &mdash; if any scripts end the drag operation, it must be considered
  unsuccessful (canceled) and the <code title="event-drop">drop</code>
  event must not be fired.</p>

  <p>User agents should take care to not start drag-and-drop
  operations in response to script actions. For example, in a
  mouse-and-window environment, if a script moves a window while the
  user has his mouse button depressed, the UA would not consider that
  to start a drag. This is important because otherwise UAs could cause
  data to be dragged from sensitive sources and dropped into hostile
  documents without the user's consent.</p>





  <h3 id="undo"><dfn>Undo history</dfn></h3>

  <p class="XXX">There has got to be a better way of doing this, surely.</p>

  <p>The user agent must associate an <dfn>undo transaction
  history</dfn> with each <code>HTMLDocument</code> object.</p>

  <p>The <span>undo transaction history</span> is a list of
  entries. The entries are of two type: <span>DOM changes</span> and
  <span title="undo object">undo objects</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <dfn>DOM changes</dfn> entry in the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> consists of batches of one or more of the
  following:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Changes to the <span>content attributes</span> of an
   <code>Element</code> node.</li>

   <li>Changes to the <span>DOM attributes</span> of a
   <code>Node</code>.</li> <!-- XXX uh, these change on their own, so
   clearly this isn't going to fly. Which DOM attributes, exactly? -->

   <li>Changes to the DOM hierarchy of nodes that are descendants of
   the <code>HTMLDocument</code> object (<code>parentNode</code>,
   <code>childNodes</code>).</li>

  </ul>

  <p><dfn>Undo object</dfn> entries consist of objects representing
  state that scripts running in the document are managing. For
  example, a Web mail application could use an <span>undo
  object</span> to keep track of the fact that a user has moved an
  e-mail to a particular folder, so that the user can undo the
  action and have the e-mail return to its former location.</p>

  <p>Broadly speaking, <span>DOM changes</span> entries are handled by
  the UA in response to user edits of form controls and <span>editing
  hosts</span> on the page, and <span>undo object</span> entries are
  handled by script in response to higher-level user actions (such as
  interactions with server-side state, or in the implementation of a
  drawing tool).</p>


  <h4>The <code>UndoManager</code> interface</h4>

  <div class="XXX">

   <p>This API sucks. Seriously. It's a terrible API. Really bad. I
   hate it. Here are the requirements:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>Has to cope with cases where the server has undo state already
    when the page is loaded, that can be stuffed into the undo buffer
    onload.</li>

    <li>Has to support undo/redo.</li>

    <li>Has to cope with the "undo" action being "contact the server
    and tell it to undo", rather than it being the opposite of the
    "redo" action.</li>

    <li>Has to cope with some undo states expiring from the undo
    history (e.g. server can only remember one undelete action) but
    other states not expiring (e.g. client can undo arbitrary amounts
    of local edits).</li>

   </ul>

  </div>

  <p>To manage <span>undo object</span> entries in the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>, the <code>UndoManager</code>
  interface can be used:</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>UndoManager</dfn> {
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-UndoManager-length">length</span>;
  [IndexGetter] any <span title="dom-UndoManager-item">item</span>(in unsigned long index);
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title="dom-UndoManager-position">position</span>;
  unsigned long <span title="dom-UndoManager-add">add</span>(in any data, in DOMString title);
  void <span title="dom-UndoManager-remove">remove</span>(in unsigned long index);
  void <span title="dom-UndoManager-clearUndo">clearUndo</span>();
  void <span title="dom-UndoManager-clearRedo">clearRedo</span>();
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-undoManager"><code>undoManager</code></dfn>
  attribute of the <code>Window</code> interface must return the
  object implementing the <code>UndoManager</code> interface for that
  <code>Window</code> object's associated
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> object.</p>

  <p><code>UndoManager</code> objects represent their document's
  <span>undo transaction history</span>. Only <span>undo object</span>
  entries are visible with this API, but this does not mean that
  <span>DOM changes</span> entries are absent from the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManager-length"><code>length</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the number of <span>undo object</span> entries
  in the <span>undo transaction history</span>. This is the <var
  title="dom-UndoManager-length">length</var>.</p>

  <p>The object's <span>indices of the supported indexed
  properties</span> are the numbers in the range zero to <span><var
  title="dom-UndoManager-length">length</var>-1</span>, unless the
  <var title="dom-UndoManager-length">length</var> is zero, in which
  case there are no <span>supported indexed properties</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManager-item"><code>item(<var
  title="">n</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var
  title="">n</var>th <span>undo object</span> entry in the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span>undo transaction history</span> has a <dfn title="undo
  position">current position</dfn>. This is the position between two
  entries in the <span>undo transaction history</span>'s list where
  the previous entry represents what needs to happen if the user
  invokes the "undo" command (the "undo" side, lower numbers), and the
  next entry represents what needs to happen if the user invokes the
  "redo" command (the "redo" side, higher numbers).</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-UndoManager-position"><code>position</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the index of the <span>undo object</span>
  entry nearest to the <span>undo position</span>, on the "redo"
  side. If there are no <span>undo object</span> entries on the "redo"
  side, then the attribute must return the same as the <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-length">length</code> attribute. If there are
  no <span>undo object</span> entries on the "undo" side of the
  <span>undo position</span>, the <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-position">position</code> attribute returns
  zero.</p>

  <p class="note">Since the <span>undo transaction history</span>
  contains both <span>undo object</span> entries and <span>DOM
  changes</span> entries, but the <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-position">position</code> attribute only
  returns indices relative to <span>undo object</span> entries, it is
  possible for several "undo" or "redo" actions to be performed
  without the value of the <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-position">position</code> attribute
  changing.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManager-add"><code>add(<var title="">data</var>,
  <var title="">title</var>)</code></dfn> method's behavior depends on the
  current state. Normally, it must insert the <var title="">data</var> object
  passed as an argument into the <span>undo transaction history</span>
  immediately before the <span>undo position</span>, optionally
  remembering the given <var title="">title</var> to use in the UI. If the
  method is called <span title="do-undo">during an undo
  operation</span>, however, the object must instead be added
  immediately <em>after</em> the <span>undo position</span>.</p>

  <p>If the method is called and there is neither <span
  title="do-undo">an undo operation in progress</span> nor <span
  title="do-redo">a redo operation in progress</span> then any entries
  in the <span>undo transaction history</span> after the <span>undo
  position</span> must be removed (as if <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-clearRedo">clearRedo()</code> had been
  called).</p>

  <p class="XXX">We could fire events when someone adds
  something to the undo history -- one event per undo object entry
  before the position (or after, during redo addition), allowing the
  script to decide if that entry should remain or not. Or
  something. Would make it potentially easier to expire server-held
  state when the server limitations come into play.</p>

  <!-- XXX note on expiring undo in case server can only do one level undo -->

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManager-remove"><code>remove(<var
  title="">index</var>)</code></dfn> method must remove the <span>undo
  object</span> entry with the specified <var title="">index</var>. If
  the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to <code
  title="dom-UndoManager-length">length</code> then the method must
  raise an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception. <span>DOM
  changes</span> entries are unaffected by this method.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-UndoManager-clearUndo"><code>clearUndo()</code></dfn>
  method must remove all entries in the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> before the <span>undo position</span>, be they
  <span>DOM changes</span> entries or <span>undo object</span>
  entries.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-UndoManager-clearRedo"><code>clearRedo()</code></dfn>
  method must remove all entries in the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> after the <span>undo position</span>, be they
  <span>DOM changes</span> entries or <span>undo object</span>
  entries.</p>

  <p class="XXX">Another idea is to have a way for scripts to
  say "startBatchingDOMChangesForUndo()" and after that the changes to
  the DOM go in as if the user had done them.</p>


  <h4><dfn title="do-undo">Undo: moving back in the undo transaction history</dfn></h4>

  <p>When the user invokes an undo operation, or when the <code
  title="dom-document-execCommand">execCommand()</code> method is
  called with the <code title="command-undo">undo</code> command, the
  user agent must perform an undo operation.</p>

  <p>If the <span>undo position</span> is at the start of the
  <span>undo transaction history</span>, then the user agent must do
  nothing.</p>

  <p>If the entry immediately before the <span>undo position</span> is
  a <span>DOM changes</span> entry, then the user agent must remove
  that <span>DOM changes</span> entry, reverse the DOM changes that
  were listed in that entry, and, if the changes were reversed with no
  problems, add a new <span>DOM changes</span> entry (consisting of
  the opposite of those DOM changes) to the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> on the other side of the <span>undo
  position</span>.</p>

  <p>If the DOM changes cannot be undone (e.g. because the DOM state
  is no longer consistent with the changes represented in the entry),
  then the user agent must simply remove the <span>DOM changes</span>
  entry, without doing anything else.</p>

  <p>If the entry immediately before the <span>undo position</span> is
  an <span>undo object</span> entry, then the user agent must first
  remove that <span>undo object</span> entry from the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>, and then must fire an <code
  title="event-undo">undo</code> event on the <code>Document</code>
  object, using the <span>undo object</span> entry's associated undo
  object as the event's data.</p>

  <p>Any calls to <code title="dom-undoManager-add">add()</code> while
  the event is being handled will be used to populate the redo
  history, and will then be used if the user invokes the "redo"
  command to undo his undo.</p>


  <h4><dfn title="do-redo">Redo: moving forward in the undo transaction history</dfn></h4>

  <p>When the user invokes a redo operation, or when the <code
  title="dom-document-execCommand">execCommand()</code> method is
  called with the <code title="command-redo">redo</code> command, the
  user agent must perform a redo operation.</p>

  <p>This is mostly the opposite of an <span title="do-undo">undo
  operation</span>, but the full definition is included here for
  completeness.</p>

  <p>If the <span>undo position</span> is at the end of the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>, then the user agent must do nothing.</p>

  <p>If the entry immediately after the <span>undo position</span> is
  a <span>DOM changes</span> entry, then the user agent must remove
  that <span>DOM changes</span> entry, reverse the DOM changes that
  were listed in that entry, and, if the changes were reversed with no
  problems, add a new <span>DOM changes</span> entry (consisting of
  the opposite of those DOM changes) to the <span>undo transaction
  history</span> on the other side of the <span>undo
  position</span>.</p>

  <p>If the DOM changes cannot be redone (e.g. because the DOM state
  is no longer consistent with the changes represented in the entry),
  then the user agent must simply remove the <span>DOM changes</span>
  entry, without doing anything else.</p>

  <p>If the entry immediately after the <span>undo position</span> is
  an <span>undo object</span> entry, then the user agent must first
  remove that <span>undo object</span> entry from the <span>undo
  transaction history</span>, and then must fire a <code
  title="event-undo">redo</code> event on the <code>Document</code>
  object, using the <span>undo object</span> entry's associated undo
  object as the event's data.</p>

  <h4>The <code>UndoManagerEvent</code> interface and the <code title="event-undo">undo</code> and <code title="event-redo">redo</code> events</h4>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>UndoManagerEvent</dfn> : Event {
  readonly attribute any <span title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-data">data</span>;
  void <span title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-initUndoManagerEvent">initUndoManagerEvent</span>(in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in any dataArg);
  void <span title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-initUndoManagerEventNS">initUndoManagerEventNS</span>(in DOMString namespaceURIArg, in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in any dataArg);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-initUndoManagerEvent"><code>initUndoManagerEvent()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn><code
  title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-initUndoManagerEventNS">initUndoManagerEventNS()</code></dfn>
  methods must initialize the event in a manner analogous to the
  similarly-named methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a
  href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-data"><code>data</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the <span>undo object</span> for the event.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-undo"><code>undo</code></dfn> and <dfn
  title="event-redo"><code>redo</code></dfn> events do not bubble,
  cannot be canceled, and have no default action. When the user agent
  fires one of these events it must use the
  <code>UndoManagerEvent</code> interface, with the <code
  title="dom-UndoManagerEvent-data">data</code> field containing the
  relevant <span>undo object</span>.</p>


  <h4>Implementation notes</h4>

  <p>How user agents present the above conceptual model to the user is
  not defined. The undo interface could be a filtered view of the
  <span>undo transaction history</span>, it could manipulate the
  <span>undo transaction history</span> in ways not described above,
  and so forth. For example, it is possible to design a UA that
  appears to have separate <span title="undo transaction history">undo
  transaction histories</span> for each form control; similarly, it is
  possible to design systems where the user has access to more undo
  information than is present in the official (as described above)
  <span>undo transaction history</span> (such as providing a
  tree-based approach to document state). Such UI models should be
  based upon the single <span>undo transaction history</span>
  described in this section, however, such that to a script there is
  no detectable difference.</p>





  <h3>Command APIs</h3>

  <p>The <dfn id="execCommand"
  title="dom-document-execCommand"><code>execCommand(<var
  title="">commandId</var>, <var title="">showUI</var>, <var
  title="">value</var>)</code></dfn> method on the
  <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface allows scripts to perform
  actions on the <span title="the selection">current selection</span>
  or at the current caret position. Generally, these commands would be
  used to implement editor UI, for example having a "delete" button on
  a toolbar.</p>

  <p>There are three variants to this method, with one, two, and three
  arguments respectively.  The <var title="">showUI</var> and <var
  title="">value</var> parameters, even if specified, are ignored
  unless otherwise stated.</p>

  <p>When <code title="dom-document-execCommand">execCommand()</code>
  is invoked, the user agent must follow the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the given <var title="">commandId</var> maps to an entry in
   the list below whose "Enabled When" entry has a condition that is
   currently false, do nothing; abort these steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, execute the "Action" listed below for the given <var
   title="">commandId</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>A document is <dfn>ready for editing host commands</dfn> if it
  has a selection that is entirely within an <span>editing
  host</span>, or if it has no selection but its caret is inside an
  <span>editing host</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-queryCommandEnabled"><code>queryCommandEnabled(<var
  title="">commandId</var>)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must
  return true if the condition listed below under "Enabled When" for
  the given <var title="">commandId</var> is true, and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-queryCommandIndeterm"><code>queryCommandIndeterm(<var
  title="">commandId</var>)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must
  return true if the condition listed below under "Indeterminate When"
  for the given <var title="">commandId</var> is true, and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-queryCommandState"><code>queryCommandState(<var
  title="">commandId</var>)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must
  return the value expressed below under "State" for the given <var
  title="">commandId</var>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-queryCommandSupported"><code>queryCommandSupported(<var
  title="">commandId</var>)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must
  return true if the given <var title="">commandId</var> is in the
  list below, and false otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-document-queryCommandValue"><code>queryCommandValue(<var
  title="">commandId</var>)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must
  return the value expressed below under "Value" for the given <var
  title="">commandId</var>.</p>

  <p>The possible values for <var title="">commandId</var>, and their
  corresponding meanings, are as follows. These values must be
  compared to the argument in an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span>
  manner.</p>

  <h3>Event definitions</h3>

  <p>Messages in <span>server-sent events</span>, <span>Web
  sockets</span>, <span>cross-document messaging</span>, and
  <span>channel messaging</span> use the <dfn
  title="event-message"><code>message</code></dfn> event.</p>

  <p>The following interface is defined for this event:</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>MessageEvent</dfn> : Event {
  readonly attribute any <span title="dom-MessageEvent-data">data</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-MessageEvent-origin">origin</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title="dom-MessageEvent-lastEventId">lastEventId</span>;
  readonly attribute <span>WindowProxy</span> <span title="dom-MessageEvent-source">source</span>;
  readonly attribute <span>MessagePort</span> <span title="dom-MessageEvent-messagePort">messagePort</span>;
  void <span title="dom-MessageEvent-initMessageEvent">initMessageEvent</span>(in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in any dataArg, in DOMString originArg, in DOMString lastEventIdArg, in <span>WindowProxy</span> sourceArg, in <span>MessagePort</span> messagePortArg);
  void <span title="dom-MessageEvent-initMessageEventNS">initMessageEventNS</span>(in DOMString namespaceURI, in DOMString typeArg, in boolean canBubbleArg, in boolean cancelableArg, in any dataArg, in DOMString originArg, in DOMString lastEventIdArg, in <span>WindowProxy</span> sourceArg, in <span>MessagePort</span> messagePortArg);
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-MessageEvent-initMessageEvent"><code>initMessageEvent()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn
  title="dom-MessageEvent-initMessageEventNS"><code>initMessageEventNS()</code></dfn>
  methods must initialize the event in a manner analogous to the
  similarly-named methods in the DOM3 Events interfaces. <a
  href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-MessageEvent-data"><code>data</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the message being sent.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-MessageEvent-origin"><code>origin</code></dfn> attribute
  represents, in <span>server-sent events</span> and
  <span>cross-document messaging</span>, the <span>origin</span> of
  the document that sent the message (typically the scheme, hostname,
  and port of the document, but not its path or fragment
  identifier).</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-MessageEvent-lastEventId"><code>lastEventId</code></dfn>
  attribute represents, in <span>server-sent events</span>, the
  <span>last event ID string</span> of the event source.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-MessageEvent-source"><code>source</code></dfn> attribute
  represents, in <span>cross-document messaging</span>, the
  <code>WindowProxy</code> of the <span>browsing context</span> of the
  <code>Window</code> object from which the message came.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-MessageEvent-messagePort"><code>messagePort</code></dfn>
  attribute represents, in <span>cross-document messaging</span> and
  <span>channel messaging</span> the <code>MessagePort</code> being
  sent, if any.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified, when the user agent creates and
  dispatches a <code title="event-message">message</code> event in the
  algorithms described in the following sections, the <code
  title="dom-MessageEvent-lastEventId">lastEventId</code> attribute
  must be the empty string, the <code
  title="dom-MessageEvent-origin">origin</code> attribute must be the
  empty string, the <code
  title="dom-MessageEvent-source">source</code> attribute must be
  null, and the <code title="dom-MessageEvent-messagePort">messagePort</code>
  attribute must be null.</p>


  <h3 id="server-sent-events"><dfn>Server-sent events</dfn></h3>
  <!-- eventsource -->

  <p>This section describes a mechanism for allowing servers to
  dispatch DOM events into documents that expect it. The
  <code>eventsource</code> element provides a simple interface to
  this mechanism.</p>



  <h4>The <code>RemoteEventTarget</code> interface</h4>

  <p>Any object that implements the <code>EventTarget</code> interface
  must also implement the <code>RemoteEventTarget</code>
  interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">[NoInterfaceObject, ImplementedOn=<span>EventTarget</span>] interface <dfn>RemoteEventTarget</dfn> {
  void <span title="dom-RemoteEventTarget-addEventSource">addEventSource</span>(in DOMString src);
  void <span title="dom-RemoteEventTarget-removeEventSource">removeEventSource</span>(in DOMString src);
};</pre>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-RemoteEventTarget-addEventSource"><code>addEventSource(<var
  title="">src</var>)</code></dfn> method is invoked, the user agent
  must <span title="resolve a url">resolve</span> the <span>URL</span>
  specified in <var title="">src</var>, relative to the <span>first
  script</span>'s <span title="script's base URL">base URL</span>, and
  if that succeeds, add the resulting <span>absolute URL</span> to the
  <span title="concept-eventsource-list">list of event sources</span>
  for that object. The same URL can be registered multiple times. If
  the URL fails to resolve, then the user agent must raise a
  <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception.</p>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-RemoteEventTarget-removeEventSource"><code>removeEventSource(<var
  title="">src</var>)</code></dfn> method is invoked, the user agent
  must <span title="resolve a url">resolve</span> the <span>URL</span>
  specified in <var title="">src</var>, relative to the <span>first
  script</span>'s <span title="script's base URL">base URL</span>, and
  if that succeeds, remove the resulting <span>absolute URL</span>
  from the <span title="concept-eventsource-list">list of event
  sources</span> for that object. If the same URL has been registered
  multiple times, removing it must remove only one instance of that
  URL for each invocation of the <code
  title="removeEventSource">removeEventSource()</code> method. If the
  URL fails to resolve, the user agent does nothing.</p>


  <h4>Connecting to an event stream</h4>

  <p>Each object implementing the <code>EventTarget</code> and
  <code>RemoteEventTarget</code> interfaces has a <dfn
  title="concept-eventsource-list">list of event sources</dfn> that
  are registered for that object.</p>

  <p>When a new <span>absolute URL</span> is added to this list, the
  user agent should <span>queue a task</span> to run the following
  steps with the new <span>absolute URL</span>:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the entry for the new <span>absolute URL</span> has been
   removed from the list, then abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Fetch</span> the resource identified by that
    <span>absolute URL</span>.</p>

    <p>As data is received, the <span
    title="concept-task">tasks</span> queued by the <span>networking
    task source</span> to handle the data must consist of following
    the rules given in the following sections.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>When an event source is removed from the list of event sources
  for an object, if that resource is still being fetched, then the
  relevant connection must be closed.</p>

  <p>Since connections established to remote servers for such
  resources are expected to be long-lived, UAs should ensure that
  appropriate buffering is used. In particular, while line buffering
  may be safe if lines are defined to end with a single U+000A LINE
  FEED character, block buffering or line buffering with different
  expected line endings can cause delays in event dispatch.</p>

  <p>Each event source in the list must have associated with it the
  following:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The <dfn
   title="concept-event-stream-reconnection-time">reconnection
   time</dfn>, in milliseconds. This must initially be a
   user-agent-defined value, probably in the region of a few
   seconds.</li>

   <li>The <dfn title="concept-event-stream-last-event-id">last event
   ID string</dfn>. This must initially be the empty string.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>In general, the semantics of the transport protocol specified by
  the URLs for the event sources must be followed, including HTTP
  caching rules.</p>

  <p>For HTTP connections, the <code title="">Accept</code> header may
  be included; if included, it must contain only formats of event
  framing that are supported by the user agent (one of which must be
  <code>text/event-stream</code>, as described below).</p>

  <p>Other formats of event framing may also be supported in addition
  to <code>text/event-stream</code>, but this specification does not
  define how they are to be parsed or processed.</p>

  <p class="note">Such formats could include systems like SMS-push;
  for example servers could use <code title="">Accept</code> headers
  and HTTP redirects to an SMS-push mechanism as a kind of protocol
  negotiation to reduce network load in GSM environments.</p>

  <p>User agents should use the <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code>
  header in requests to bypass any caches for requests of event
  sources.</p>

  <p>If the event source's last event ID string is not the empty
  string, then a <code title="">Last-Event-ID</code> HTTP header must
  be included with the request, whose value is the value of the event
  source's last event ID string.</p>

  <p>For connections to domains other than <span>the document's
  domain</span>, the semantics of the Access-Control HTTP header must
  be followed. <a href="#refsACCESSCONTROL">[ACCESSCONTROL]</a> <!--
  XXX define this better once that spec is more stable -->

  <p>HTTP 200 OK responses with a <span>Content-Type</span> header
  specifying the type <code>text/event-stream</code> that are either
  from <span>the document's domain</span> or explicitly allowed by the
  Access-Control HTTP headers must be processed line by line <a
  href="#event-stream-interpretation">as described below</a>.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of such successfully opened event streams only,
  user agents should ignore HTTP cache headers, and instead assume
  that the resource indicates that it does not wish to be cached.</p>

  <p>If such a resource (with the correct MIME type) completes loading
  (i.e. the entire HTTP response body is received or the connection
  itself closes), the user agent should request the event source
  resource again after a delay equal to the reconnection time of the
  event source. This doesn't apply for the error cases that are listed
  below.</p>

  <p>HTTP 200 OK responses that have a <span>Content-Type</span> other
  than <code>text/event-stream</code> (or some other supported type),
  and HTTP responses whose Access-Control headers indicate that the
  resource are not to be used, must be ignored.</p>

  <p>HTTP 204 No Content, and 205 Reset Content responses must be
  treated as if they were 200 OK responses with the right MIME type
  but no content, and should therefore cause the user agent to refetch
  the resource after a delay equal to the reconnection time of the
  event source.</p>

  <p>Other HTTP response codes in the 2xx range <!--201 Created, 202
  Accepted, 203 Non-Authoritative Information, and 206 Partial
  Content-->must be treated like HTTP 200 OK responses for the
  purposes of reopening event source resources. They are, however,
  likely to indicate an error has occurred somewhere and may cause the
  user agent to emit a warning.</p>

  <p>HTTP 300 Multiple Choices responses should be handled
  automatically if possible (treating the responses as if they were
  302 Found responses pointing to the appropriate resource), and
  otherwise must be treated as HTTP 404 responses.</p>

  <p>HTTP 301 Moved Permanently responses must cause the user agent to
  reconnect using the new server specified URL instead of the
  previously specified URL for all subsequent requests for this event
  source. (It doesn't affect other event sources with the same URL
  unless they also receive 301 responses, and it doesn't affect future
  sessions, e.g. if the page is reloaded.)</p>

  <p>HTTP 302 Found, 303 See Other, and 307 Temporary Redirect
  responses must cause the user agent to connect to the new
  server-specified URL, but if the user agent needs to again request
  the resource at a later point, it must return to the previously
  specified URL for this event source.</p>

  <p>HTTP 304 Not Modified responses should be handled like HTTP 200
  OK responses, with the content coming from the user agent cache. A
  new request should then be made after a delay equal to the
  reconnection time of the event source.</p>

  <p>HTTP 305 Use Proxy, HTTP 401 Unauthorized, and 407 Proxy
  Authentication Required should be treated transparently as for any
  other subresource.</p>

  <p>Any other HTTP response code not listed here or network error
  (e.g. DNS errors) must be ignored.</p> <!-- including: HTTP 400 Bad
  Request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, 406
  Not Acceptable, 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict, 410 Gone, 411

  <h4>Parsing an event stream</h4>

  <!-- XXX Wladimir Palant pointed out problems with HTTP chunking with server-sent-events -->

  <p>This event stream format's MIME type is
  <code>text/event-stream</code>.</p>

  <p>The event stream format is as described by the <code
  title="">stream</code> production of the following ABNF, the
  character set for which is Unicode. <a
  href="#refsABNF">[ABNF]</a></p> <!-- XXX
  ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/std/std68.txt -->

  <pre>stream        = [ bom ] *event
event         = *( comment / field ) end-of-line
comment       = colon *any-char end-of-line
field         = 1*name-char [ colon [ space ] *any-char ] end-of-line
end-of-line   = ( cr lf / cr / lf / eof )
eof           = &lt; matches repeatedly at the end of the stream >

; characters
lf            = %x000A ; U+000A LINE FEED
cr            = %x000D ; U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN
space         = %x0020 ; U+0020 SPACE
colon         = %x003A ; U+003A COLON
bom           = %xFEFF ; U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK
name-char     = %x0000-0009 / %x000B-000C / %x000E-0039 / %x003B-10FFFF
                ; a Unicode character other than U+000A LINE FEED, U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN, or U+003A COLON
any-char      = %x0000-0009 / %x000B-000C / %x000E-10FFFF
                ; a Unicode character other than U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN or U+003A COLON</pre>

  <p>Event streams in this format must always be encoded as
  UTF-8.</p>

  <p>Lines must be separated by either a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A
  LINE FEED (CRLF) character pair, a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
  character, or a single U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character.</p>



  <h4 id="event-stream-interpretation">Interpreting an event stream</h4>

  <p>Bytes or sequences of bytes that are not valid UTF-8 sequences
  must be interpreted as the U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.</p>

  <p>One leading U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK character must be ignored if
  any are present.</p>

  <p>The stream must then be parsed by reading everything line by
  line, with a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF)
  character pair, a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, a single
  U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character, and the end of the file being
  the four ways in which a line can end.</p>

  <p>When a stream is parsed, a <var title="">data</var> buffer and an
  <var title="">event name</var> buffer must be associated with
  it. They must be initialized to the empty string</p>

  <p>Lines must be processed, in the order they are received, as
  follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the line is empty (a blank line)</dt>

   <dd><p><a href="#dispatchMessage">Dispatch the event</a>, as

   <dd>

    <p>Collect the characters on the line before the first U+003A
    COLON character (':'), and let <var title="">field</var> be that
    string.</p>

    <p>Collect the characters on the line after the first U+003A COLON
    character (':'), and let <var title="">value</var> be that
    string. If <var title="">value</var> starts with a single U+0020
    SPACE character, remove it from <var title="">value</var>.</p>

    <p><a href="#processField">Process the field</a> using the steps

  <p id="dispatchMessage">When the user agent is required to <dfn

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <var title="">data</var> buffer is an empty string,

   <li><p>Otherwise, create an event that uses the

   must be set to the <span>last event ID string</span> of the event
   source.</p></li>
   
   <li><p>If the <var title="">event name</var> buffer has a value
   other than the empty string, change the type of the newly created

   <li><p>Set the <var title="">data</var> buffer and the <var

   task source</dfn>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">If an event doesn't have an "id" field, but an

  string</span>, then the event's <code
  title="dom-MessageEvent-lastEventId">lastEventId</code> field will
  be set to the value of whatever the last seen "id" field was.</p>


  <div class="example">

   <p>The following event stream, once followed by a blank line:</p>
   <pre>data: YHOO
data: -2
data: 10</pre>

   <p>...would cause an event <code
   title="event-message">message</code> with the interface
   <code>MessageEvent</code> to be dispatched on the
   <code>eventsource</code> element, whose <code
   title="dom-MessageEvent-data">data</code> attribute would contain
   the string <code>YHOO\n-2\n10</code> (where <code>\n</code>
   represents a newline).</p>

   <p>This could be used as follows:
   <pre>&lt;eventsource src="http://stocks.example.com/ticker.php"
              onmessage="var data = event.data.split('\n'); updateStocks(data[0], data[1], data[2]);"&gt;</pre>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following stream contains four blocks. The first block has
   just a comment, and will fire nothing. The second block has two
   fields with names "data" and "id" respectively; an event will be
   fired for this block, with the data "first event", and will then
   set the last event ID to "1" so that if the connection died between
   this block and the next, the server would be sent a <code
   title="">Last-Event-ID</code> header with the value "1". The third
   block fires an event with data "second event", and also has an "id"
   field, this time with no value, which resets the last event ID to
   the empty string (meaning no <code title="">Last-Event-ID</code>
   header will now be sent in the event of a reconnection being
   attempted). Finally the last block just fires an event with the
   data "third event". Note that the last block doesn't have to end
   with a blank line, the end of the stream is enough to trigger the
   dispatch of the last event.</p>

   <pre>: test stream

data: first event
id: 1

data: second event
id

data: third event</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following stream fires just one event:</p>

   <pre>data

data
data

data:</pre>

   <p>The first and last blocks do nothing, since they do not contain
   any actual data (the <var title="">data</var> buffer remains at the
   empty string, and so nothing gets dispatched). The middle block
   fires an event with the data set to a single newline character.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following stream fires two identical events:</p>

   <pre>data:test

data:&nbsp;test</pre>

   <p>This is because the space after the colon is ignored if
   present.</p>

  </div>


  <h4>Notes</h4>

  <p>Legacy proxy servers are known to, in certain cases, drop HTTP
  connections after a short timeout. To protect against such proxy
  servers, authors can include a comment line (one starting with a ':'
  character) every 15 seconds or so.</p>

  <p>Authors wishing to relate event source connections to each other
  or to specific documents previously served might find that relying
  on IP addresses doesn't work, as individual clients can have
  multiple IP addresses (due to having multiple proxy servers) and
  individual IP addresses can have multiple clients (due to sharing a
  proxy server). It is better to include a unique identifier in the
  document when it is served and then pass that identifier as part of
  the URL in the <code title="attr-eventsource-src">src</code>
  attribute of the <code>eventsource</code> element.</p>

  <p>Implementations that support HTTP's per-server connection
  limitation might run into trouble when opening multiple pages from a
  site if each page has an <code>eventsource</code> to the same
  domain. Authors can avoid this using the relatively complex
  mechanism of using unique domain names per connection, or by
  allowing the user to enable or disable the <code>eventsource</code>
  functionality on a per-page basis.</p>



  <h3 id="network"><dfn>Web sockets</dfn></h3>

  <h4 id="network-intro">Introduction</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>To enable Web applications to maintain bidirectional
  communications with server-side processes, this specification
  introduces the <code>WebSocket</code> interface.</p>

  <p class="note">This interface does not allow for raw access to the
  underlying network. For example, this interface could not be used to
  implement an IRC client without proxying messages through a custom
  server.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-WebSocket"><code>WebSocket(<var

  <var title="">url</var>, which specifies the <span>URL</span> to

   <li><p>If the <span title="url-scheme">&lt;scheme&gt;</span>
   component of <var title="">url</var> is "<code title="">ws</code>",
   set <var title="">secure</var> to false; otherwise, the <span

   <li><p>If <var title="">url</var> has a <span

   no explicit <var title="">port</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">resource name</var> be the value of the
   <span title="url-path">&lt;path&gt;</span> component (which might
   be empty) of <var title="">url</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-WebSocket-URL"><code>URL</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the value that was passed to the
  constructor.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-WebSocket-readyState"><code>readyState</code></dfn>
  attribute represents the state of the connection. It can have the
  following values:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-WebSocket-CONNECTING"><code>CONNECTING</code></dfn> (numeric value 0)</dt>

   <dd>The connection has not yet been established.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-WebSocket-OPEN"><code>OPEN</code></dfn> (numeric value 1)</dt>

   <dd>The <span>Web Socket connection is established</span> and communication is possible.</dd>

   <dt><dfn title="dom-WebSocket-CLOSED"><code>CLOSED</code></dfn> (numeric value 2)</dt>

   <dd>The connection has been closed or could not be opened.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>When the object is created its <code
  title="dom-WebSocket-readyState">readyState</code> must be set to
  <code title="dom-WebSocket-CONNECTING">CONNECTING</code> (0). The
  steps executed when the constructor is invoked change this
  attribute's value.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-WebSocket-postMessage"><code>postMessage(<var
  title="">data</var>)</code></dfn> method transmits data using the
  connection. If the connection is not established (<code
  title="dom-WebSocket-readyState">readyState</code> is not <code
  title="dom-WebSocket-OPEN">OPEN</code>), it must raise an
  <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception. If the connection
  <em>is</em> established, then the user agent must <span>send <var
  title="">data</var> using the Web Socket</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-WebSocket-disconnect"><code>disconnect()</code></dfn>
  method must <span>close the Web Socket connection</span> or
  connection attempt, if any. If the connection is already closed, it
  must do nothing. Closing the connection causes a <code
  title="event-WebSocket-close">close</code> event to be fired and
  the <code title="dom-WebSocket-readyState">readyState</code>
  attribute's value to change, as <a href="#closeWebSocket">described
  below</a>.</p>


  <h4>WebSocket Events</h4>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-WebSocket-open"><code>open</code></dfn>
  event is fired when the <span>Web Socket connection is
  established</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn title="event-WebSocket-close"><code>close</code></dfn>
  event is fired when the connection is closed (whether by the author,
  calling the <code
  title="dom-WebSocket-disconnect">disconnect()</code> method, or by
  the server, or by a network error).</p>

  <p class="note">No information regarding why the connection was
  closed is passed to the application in this version of this
  specification.</p>

  <p>The <code title="event-message">message</code> event is fired
  when when data is received for a connection.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The following are the <span>event handler attributes</span> that

  <h5>Server-side requirements</h5>

  <p><em>This section only applies to servers.</em></p> <!-- XXX that's not a defined conformance class -->

  <h6>Minimal handshake</h6>

  <p class="note">This section describes the minimal requirements for
  a server-side implementation of Web Sockets.</p>

  <p>Listen on a port for TCP/IP. Upon receiving a connection request,
  open a connection and send the following bytes back to the
  client:</p>

  <pre>48 54 54 50 2f 31 2e 31  20 31 30 31 20 57 65 62
20 53 6f 63 6b 65 74 20  50 72 6f 74 6f 63 6f 6c
20 48 61 6e 64 73 68 61  6b 65 0d 0a 55 70 67 72
61 64 65 3a 20 57 65 62  53 6f 63 6b 65 74 0d 0a
43 6f 6e 6e 65 63 74 69  6f 6e 3a 20 55 70 67 72
61 64 65 0d 0a</pre>

  <p>Send the string "<code title="">WebSocket-Origin</code>" followed
  by a U+003A COLON (":") followed by the <span title="ASCII
  serialization of an origin">ASCII serialization</span> of the origin
  from which the server is willing to accept connections, followed by
  a CRLF pair (0x0d 0x0a).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For instance:</p>

   <pre>WebSocket-Origin: http://example.com</pre>

  </div>

  <p>Send the string "<code title="">WebSocket-Location</code>"
  followed by a U+003A COLON (":") followed by the <span>URL</span> of
  the Web Socket script, followed by a CRLF pair (0x0d 0x0a).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For instance:</p>

   <pre>WebSocket-Location: ws://example.com:80/demo</pre>

  </div>

  <p>Send another CRLF pair (0x0d 0x0a).</p>

  <p>Read (and discard) data from the client until four bytes 0x0d
  0x0a 0x0d 0x0a are read.</p>

  <p>If the connection isn't dropped at this point, go to the <a
  href="#ws-sd-framing">data framing</a> section.</p>


  <h6>Handshake details</h6>

  <p>The previous section ignores the data that is transmitted by the
  client during the handshake.</p>

  <p>The data sent by the client consists of a number of fields
  separated by CR LF pairs (bytes 0x0d 0x0a).</p>

  <p>The first field consists of three tokens separated by space
  characters (byte 0x20). The middle token is the path being
  opened. If the server supports multiple paths, then the server
  should echo the value of this field in the initial handshake, as
  part of the <span>URL</span> given on the <code
  title="">WebSocket-Location</code> line (after the appropriate
  scheme and host).</p>

  <p>The remaining fields consist of name-value pairs, with the name
  part separated from the value part by a colon and a space (bytes
  0x3a 0x20). Of these, several are interesting:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Host (bytes 48 6f 73 74)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The value gives the hostname that the client intended to use
    when opening the Web Socket. It would be of interest in particular
    to virtual hosting environments, where one server might serve
    multiple hosts, and might therefore want to return different
    data.</p>

    <p>The right host has to be output as part of the <span>URL</span>
    given on the <code title="">WebSocket-Location</code> line of the
    handshake described above, to verify that the server knows that it
    is really representing that host.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Origin (bytes 4f 72 69 67 69 6e)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The value gives the scheme, hostname, and port (if it's not the
    default port for the given scheme) of the page that asked the
    client to open the Web Socket. It would be interesting if the
    server's operator had deals with operators of other sites, since
    the server could then decide how to respond (or indeed,
    <em>whether</em> to respond) based on which site was requesting a
    connection.</p>

    <p>If the server supports connections from more than one origin,
    then the server should echo the value of this field in the initial
    handshake, on the <code title="">WebSocket-Origin</code> line.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Other fields</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Other fields can be used, such as "<code
    title="">Cookie</code>" or "<code>Authorization</code>", for
    authentication purposes.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>


  <h6 id="ws-sd-framing">Data framing</h6>

  that this specification allows user agents to send (text). It
  doesn't handle any arbitrary content in the same way that the
  requirements on user agents defined earlier handle any content
  including possible future extensions to the protocols.</p>

  <p>The server should run through the following steps to process the
  bytes sent by the client:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Read a byte from the client. Assuming everything is going
   according to plan, it will be a 0x00 byte. Behaviour for the server

   array.</p></li>

   <li id="ws-sd-data"><p><i>Data</i>: Read a byte, let <var
   title="">b</var> be that byte.</p></li>

  <h5>Closing the connection</h5>

  <p>To <dfn>close the Web Socket connection</dfn>, either the user
  agent or the server closes the TCP/IP connection. There is no
  closing handshake. Whether the user agent or the server closes the
  connection, it is said that the <dfn>Web Socket connection is
  closed</dfn>.</p>

  <p>Servers may <span>close the Web Socket connection</span> whenever
  desired.</p>

  <p>User agents should not <span>close the Web Socket
  connection</span> arbitrarily.</p>

  <h3 id="crossDocumentMessages"><dfn>Cross-document messaging</dfn></h3>

  <p>Web browsers, for security and privacy reasons, prevent documents
  in different domains from affecting each other; that is, cross-site
  scripting is disallowed.</p>

  <p>While this is an important security feature, it prevents pages
  from different domains from communicating even when those pages are
  not hostile. This section introduces a messaging system that allows
  documents to communicate with each other regardless of their source
  domain, in a way designed to not enable cross-site scripting
  attacks.</p>

  <p>The <span>task source</span> for the <span
  title="concept-task">tasks</span> in <span>cross-document
  messaging</span> is the <dfn>posted message task source</dfn>.</p>


  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, if document A contains an <code>iframe</code>
   element that contains document B, and script in document A calls
   <code title="dom-window-postMessage-2">postMessage()</code> on the
   <code>Window</code> object of document B, then a message event will
   be fired on that object, marked as originating from the
   <code>Window</code> of document A.  The script in document A might
   look like:</p>

   <pre>var o = document.getElementsByTagName('iframe')[0];
o.contentWindow.postMessage('Hello world', 'http://b.example.org/');</pre>

   <p>To register an event handler for incoming events, the script
   would use <code title="">addEventListener()</code> (or similar
   mechanisms).  For example, the script in document B might look
   like:</p>

   <pre>window.addEventListener('message', receiver, false);
function receiver(e) {
  if (e.origin == 'http://example.com') {
    if (e.data == 'Hello world') {
      e.source.postMessage('Hello', e.origin);
    } else {
      alert(e.data);
    }
  }
}</pre>

   <p>This script first checks the domain is the expected domain, and
   then looks at the message, which it either displays to the user, or
   responds to by sending a message back to the document which sent
   the message in the first place.</p>

  </div>


  <h4>Security</h4>

  <h5>Authors</h5>

  <p class="warning">Use of this API requires extra care to protect
  users from hostile entities abusing a site for their own
  purposes.</p>

  <p>Authors should check the <code
  title="dom-MessageEvent-origin">origin</code> attribute to ensure
  that messages are only accepted from domains that they expect to
  receive messages from. Otherwise, bugs in the author's message
  handling code could be exploited by hostile sites.</p>

  <p>Authors should not use the wildcard keyword ("*") in the <var
  title="">targetOrigin</var> argument in messages that contain any
  confidential information, as otherwise there is no way to guarantee
  that the message is only delivered to the recipient to which it was
  intended.</p>


  <h5>User agents</h5>

  <p>The integrity of this API is based on the inability for scripts
  of one <span>origin</span> to post arbitrary events (using <code
  title="">dispatchEvent()</code> or otherwise) to objects in other
  origins (those that are not the <span title="same
  origin">same</span>).</p>

  <p class="note">Implementors are urged to take extra care in the
  implementation of this feature. It allows authors to transmit
  information from one domain to another domain, which is normally
  disallowed for security reasons. It also requires that UAs be
  careful to allow access to certain properties but not others.</p>


  <h4>Posting messages</h4>

  <p>When a script invokes the <dfn
  title="dom-window-postMessage-2"><code>postMessage(<var
  title="">message</var>, <var
  title="">targetOrigin</var>)</code></dfn> method (with only two
  arguments) on a <code>Window</code> object, the user agent must
  follow these steps:

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the value of the <var title="">targetOrigin</var> argument
    is not a single U+002A ASTERISK character ("*"), and <span
    title="resolve a url">resolving</span> it relative to the
    <span>first script</span>'s <span title="script's base URL">base
    URL</span> either fails or results in a <span>URL</span> with a
    <code title="url-host-specific">&lt;host-specific&gt;</code>
    component that is neither empty nor a single U+002F SOLIDUS
    character (/), then throw a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception and
    abort the overall set of steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">message clone</var> be the result of
    obtaining a <span>structured clone</span> of the <var
    title="">message</var> argument. If this throws an exception, then
    throw that exception and abort these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Return from the <code
    title="dom-window-postMessage-2">postMessage()</code> method, but
    asynchronously continue running these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <var title="">targetOrigin</var> argument has a value
    other than a single literal U+002A ASTERISK character ("*"), and
    the <code>Document</code> of the <code>Window</code> object on
    which the method was invoked does not have the <span>same
    origin</span> as <var title="">targetOrigin</var>, then abort
    these steps silently.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Create an event that uses the <code>MessageEvent</code>
    interface, with the event name <code
    title="event-message">message</code>, which does not bubble, is
    cancelable, and has no default action. The <code
    title="dom-MessageEvent-data">data</code> attribute must be set to
    the value of <var title="">message clone</var>, the <code

    set to the <span title="Unicode serialization of an
    origin">Unicode serialization</span> of the <span>origin</span> of
    the script that invoked the method, and the <code
    title="dom-MessageEvent-source">source</code> attribute must be
    set to the <span>script's global object</span>.</p> <!-- invariant:
    the global scope is always a Window if the script can see this
    method -->

   </li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Queue a task</span> to dispatch the event created in the
    previous step at the <code>Window</code> object on which the
    method was invoked. The <span>task source</span> for this <span
    title="concept-task">task</span> is the <span>posted message task
    source</span>.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>


  <h4>Posting messages with message ports</h4>

  <p>When a script invokes the <dfn
  title="dom-window-postMessage-3"><code>postMessage(<var
  title="">message</var>, <var title="">messagePort</var>, <var
  title="">targetOrigin</var>)</code></dfn> method (with three
  arguments) on a <code>Window</code> object, the user agent must
  follow these steps:

  <ol>

   <!-- EXCEPT WHERE NOTED, THESE STEPS ARE IDENTICAL TO THE PREVIOUS SECTION -->
   <!-- one exception is the use of -3 instead of -2 in the xrefs -->

   <li>

    <p>If the value of the <var title="">targetOrigin</var> argument
    is not a single U+002A ASTERISK character ("*"), and <span
    title="resolve a url">resolving</span> it relative to the
    <span>first script</span>'s <span title="script's base URL">base
    URL</span> either fails or results in a <span>URL</span> with a

    component that is neither empty nor a single U+002F SOLIDUS
    character (/), then throw a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception and
    abort the overall set of steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">message clone</var> be the result of
    obtaining a <span>structured clone</span> of the <var
    title="">message</var> argument. If this throws an exception, then
    throw that exception and abort these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li> <!-- NEW STEP -->

    <p>If the <var title="">messagePort</var> argument is null, then
    act as if the method had just been <span
    title="dom-window-postMessage-2">called with two arguments</span>,
    <var title="">message</var> and <var
    title="">targetOrigin</var>.</p>

   </li>

    <p>Try to obtain a <var title="">new port</var> by <span
    title="clone a port">cloning</span> the <var

    object on which the method was invoked as the owner of the
    clone. If this returns an exception, then throw that exception and
    abort these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Return from the <code
    title="dom-window-postMessage-3">postMessage()</code> method, but
    asynchronously continue running these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <var title="">targetOrigin</var> argument has a value
    other than a single literal U+002A ASTERISK character ("*"), and
    the <code>Document</code> of the <code>Window</code> object on

    these steps silently.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Create an event that uses the <code>MessageEvent</code>
    interface, with the event name <code
    title="event-message">message</code>, which does not bubble, is
    cancelable, and has no default action. The <code
    title="dom-MessageEvent-data">data</code> attribute must be set to
    the value of <var title="">message clone</var>, the <code

   </li>

   <li> <!-- NEW STEP -->
 
    <p>Let the <code

  <h3><dfn>Channel messaging</dfn></h3>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p class="XXX">An introduction to the channel and port
  APIs.</p>



  <h4>Message channels</h4>

  <pre class="idl">[<span title="dom-MessageChannel">Constructor</span>]
interface <dfn>MessageChannel</dfn> {
  readonly attribute <span>MessagePort</span> <span title="dom-channel-port1">port1</span>;
  readonly attribute <span>MessagePort</span> <span title="dom-channel-port2">port2</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>When the <dfn
  title="dom-MessageChannel"><code>MessageChannel()</code></dfn>
  constructor is called, it must run the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p><span>Create a new <code>MessagePort</code> object</span>
   owned by the <span>script's global object</span>, and let <var
   title="">port1</var> be that object.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Create a new <code>MessagePort</code> object</span>
   owned by the <span>script's global object</span>, and let <var
   title="">port2</var> be that object.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Entangle</span> the <var title="">port1</var> and <var
   title="">port2</var> objects.</p></li>

   <li><p>Instantiate a new <code>MessageChannel</code> object, and
   let <var title="">channel</var> be that object.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let the <code title="dom-channel-port1">port1</code>
   attribute of the <var title="">channel</var> object be <var
   title="">port1</var>.</p>

   <li><p>Let the <code title="dom-channel-port2">port2</code>
   attribute of the <var title="">channel</var> object be <var
   title="">port2</var>.</p>

   <li><p>Return <var title="">channel</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-channel-port1"><code>port1</code></dfn> and
  <dfn title="dom-channel-port2"><code>port2</code></dfn> attributes
  must return the values they were assigned when the
  <code>MessageChannel</code> object was created.</p>


  <h4>Message ports</h4>

  <p>Each channel has two message ports. Data sent through one port is
  received by the other port, and vice versa.</p>

  <pre class="idl">interface <dfn>MessagePort</dfn> {
  readonly attribute boolean <span title="dom-MessagePort-active">active</span>;
  void <span title="dom-MessagePort-postMessage">postMessage</span>(in any message, [Optional] in <span>MessagePort</span> messagePort);<!--
  <span>MessagePort</span> <span title="dom-MessagePort-startConversation">startConversation</span>(in any message);-->
  void <span title="dom-MessagePort-start">start</span>();
  void <span title="dom-MessagePort-close">close</span>();

  // event handler attributes
           attribute <span>Function</span> <span title="handler-MessagePort-onmessage">onmessage</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>Objects implementing the <code>MessagePort</code> interface must
  also implement the <code>EventTarget</code> interface.</p>

  <p>Each <code>MessagePort</code> object can be entangled with
  another (a symmetric relationship). Each <code>MessagePort</code>
  object also has a <span>task source</span> called the <dfn>port
  message queue</dfn>, initial empty. A <span>port message
  queue</span> can be open or closed, and is initially closed.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>create a new
  <code>MessagePort</code> object</dfn> owned by a <span>script's
  global object</span> object <var title="">owner</var>, it must
  instantiate a new <code>MessagePort</code> object, and let its owner
  be <var title="">owner</var>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>entangle</dfn> two
  <code>MessagePort</code> objects, it must run the following
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If one of the ports is already entangled, then unentangle it
    and the port that it was entangled with.</p>

    <p class="note">If those two previously entangled ports were the
    two ports of a <code>MessageChannel</code> object, then that
    <code>MessageChannel</code> object no longer represents an actual
    channel: the two ports in that object are no longer entangled.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Associate the two ports to be entangled, so that they form
   the two parts of a new channel. (There is no
   <code>MessageChannel</code> object that represents this
   channel.)</p></li>

  </ol>

  <hr>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>clone a port</dfn> <var
  title="">original port</var>, with the clone being owned by <var
  title="">owner</var>, it must run the following steps, which return
  either a new <code>MessagePort</code> object or an exception for the
  caller to raise:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <var title="">original port</var> is not entangled
   without another port, then return an <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>
   exception and abort all these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let the <var title="">remote port</var> be the port with
   which the <var title="">original port</var> is entangled.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Create a new <code>MessagePort</code> object</span>
   owned by <var title="">owner</var>, and let <var title="">new
   port</var> be that object.</p></li>

   <li><p>Move all the events in the <span>port message queue</span>
   of <var title="">original port</var> to the <span>port message
   queue</span> of <var title="">new port</var>, if any, leaving the
   <var title="">new port</var>'s <span>port message queue</span> in
   its initial closed state.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Entangle</span> the <var title="">remote port</var>
   and <var title="">new port</var> objects. The <var
   title="">original port</var> object will be unentangled by this
   process.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return <var title="">new port</var>. It is the
   clone.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-MessagePort-active"><code>active</code></dfn>
  attribute must return true if the port is entangled, and false
  otherwise.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-MessagePort-postMessage"><code>postMessage()</code></dfn>
  method, when called on a port <var title="">source port</var>, must
  cause the user agent to run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">message</var> be the method's first
   argument.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">data port</var> be the method's second
   argument, if any.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">message clone</var> be the result of
   obtaining a <span>structured clone</span> of the <var
   title="">message</var> argument. If this throws an exception, then
   throw that exception and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var title="">source port</var> is not entangled with
   another port, then return and abort these steps.</p></li>
   <!-- we don't raise an exception because this can happen moment's
   notice. we don't return false because if the port is _about_
   to be closed, the message might not be listened for anyway. -->

   <li><p>Let <var title="">target port</var> be the port with which
   <var title="">source port</var> is entangled.</p></li>

   <li><p>Create an event that uses the <code>MessageEvent</code>
   interface, with the name <code

   cancelable, and has no default action.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let the <code title="dom-MessageEvent-data">data</code>

   clone</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the method was called with a second argument <var
   title="">data port</var> and that argument isn't null, then run the
   following substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the <var title="">data port</var> is the <var
     title="">source port</var> or the <var title="">target
     port</var>, then throw an <code>INVALID_ACCESS_ERR</code>

     <li><p>Let the <code

    title="dom-MessagePort-start">start()</code> method had been
    called.</p>

   </dd>

  <h5>Ports and garbage collection</h5>

  <p>User agents must act as if <code>MessagePort</code> objects have
  a strong reference to their entangled <code>MessagePort</code>
  object.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p>Thus, a message port can be received, given an event listener,
   and then forgotten, and so long as that event listener could
   receive a message, the channel will be maintained.</p>

   <p>Of course, if this was to occur on both sides of the channel,
   then both ports would be garbage collected, since they would not be
   reachable from live code, despite having a strong reference to each
   other.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Furthermore, a <code>MessagePort</code> object must not be
  garbage collected while there exists a message in a <span>task
  queue</span> that is to be dispatched on that
  <code>MessagePort</code> object, or while the
  <code>MessagePort</code> object's <span>port message queue</span> is
  open and there exists a <code title="event-message">message</code>
  event in that queue.</p>
  <!-- we might not need to explicitly say the first part of DOM
  Events is fixed to say that events on a task queue prevent GC -->



  <h2 id="syntax"><dfn>The HTML syntax</dfn></h2>

  <p class="note">This section only describes the rules for <code
  title="">text/html</code> resources. Rules for XML resources are
  discussed in the section below entitled "<span>The XHTML
  syntax</span>".</p>

  <h3>Writing HTML documents</h3>

  <p><em>This section only applies to documents, authoring tools, and
  markup generators. In particular, it does not apply to conformance
  checkers; conformance checkers must use the requirements given in
  the next section ("parsing HTML documents").</em></p>

  <p>Documents must consist of the following parts, in the given
  order:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Optionally, a single U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) character.</li>

   <li>Any number of <span title="syntax-comments">comments</span> and
   <span title="space character">space characters</span>.</li>

   <li>A <span title="syntax-doctype">DOCTYPE</span>.

   <li>Any number of <span title="syntax-comments">comments</span> and
   <span title="space character">space characters</span>.</li>

   <li>The root element, in the form of an <code>html</code> <span
   title="syntax-elements">element</span>.</li>

   <li>Any number of <span title="syntax-comments">comments</span> and
   <span title="space character">space characters</span>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The various types of content mentioned above are described in the
  next few sections.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are some restrictions on how <span>character
  encoding declarations</span> are to be serialized, as discussed in
  the section on that topic.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p>Space characters before the root <code>html</code> element, and
   space characters at the start of the <code>html</code> element and
   before the <code>head</code> element, will be dropped when the
   document is parsed; space characters <em>after</em> the root
   <code>html</code> element will be parsed as if they were at the end
   of the <code>body</code> element. Thus, space characters around the
   root element do not round-trip.</p>

   <p>It is suggested that newlines be inserted after the DOCTYPE,
   after any comments that are before the root element, after the
   <code>html</code> element's start tag (if it is not <span
   title="syntax-tag-omission">omitted</span>), and after any comments
   that are inside the <code>html</code> element but before the
   <code>head</code> element.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Many strings in the HTML syntax (e.g. the names of elements and
  their attributes) are case-insensitive, but only for characters in
  the ranges U+0041 .. U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL
  LETTER Z) and U+0061 .. U+007A (LATIN SMALL LETTER A to LATIN SMALL
  LETTER Z). For convenience, in this section this is just referred to
  as "case-insensitive".</p>


  <h4>The DOCTYPE</h4>

  <p>A <dfn title="syntax-doctype">DOCTYPE</dfn> is a mostly useless,
  but required, header.</p>

  <p class="note">DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. When
  omitted, browsers tend to use a different rendering mode that is
  incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a
  document ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at
  following the relevant specifications.</p>

  <p>A DOCTYPE must consist of the following characters, in this
  order:</p>

  <ol class="brief">
   <li>A U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (<code>&lt;</code>) character.</li>
   <li>A U+0021 EXCLAMATION MARK (<code>!</code>) character.</li>
   <li>A string that is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the string "<code title="">DOCTYPE</code>".</li>
   <li>One or more <span title="space character">space characters</span>.</li>
   <li>A string that is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the string "<code title="">HTML</code>".</li>
   <li>Optionally, a <span>DOCTYPE legacy string</span> (defined below).</li>
   <li>Zero or more <span title="space character">space characters</span>.</li>
   <li>A U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (<code>&gt;</code>) character.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="note">In other words, <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML></code>,
  case-insensitively.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of HTML generators that cannot output HTML
  markup with the short DOCTYPE "<code title="">&lt;!DOCTYPE
  HTML></code>", a <dfn>DOCTYPE legacy string</dfn> may be inserted
  into the DOCTYPE (in the position defined above). This string must
  consist of:</p>

  <ol class="brief">
   <li>One or more <span title="space character">space characters</span>.</li>
   <li>A string that is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the string "<code title="">SYSTEM</code>".</li>
   <li>One or more <span title="space character">space characters</span>.</li>
   <li>A U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (the <i>quote mark</i>).</li>
   <li>The literal string "<code title="">about:legacy-compat</code>".</li>
   <li>A matching U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (i.e. the same character as in the earlier step marked <i>quote mark</i>).</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="note">In other words, <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM
  "about:legacy-compat"></code> or <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM
  'about:legacy-compat'></code>, case-insensitively except for the bit
  in quotes.</p>

  <p>The <span>DOCTYPE legacy string</span> should not be used unless
  the document is generated from a system that cannot output the
  shorter string.</p>



  <h4>Elements</h4>

  <p>There are five different kinds of <dfn
  title="syntax-elements">elements</dfn>: void elements, CDATA
  elements, RCDATA elements, foreign elements, and normal
  elements.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn>Void elements</dfn></dt>

   <dd><code>base</code>, <code>command</code>,
   <code>eventsource</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>meta</code>,
   <code>hr</code>, <code>br</code>, <code>img</code>,
   <code>embed</code>, <code>param</code>, <code>area</code>,
   <code>col</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>source</code></dd>

   <dt>CDATA elements</dt>

   <dd><code>style</code>, <code>script</code></dd> <!-- iframe and
   noscript don't count as CDATA for syntax purposes -->

   <dt>RCDATA elements</dt>

   <dd><code>title</code>, <code>textarea</code></dd>

   <dt>Foreign elements</dt>

   <dd>Elements from the <span>MathML namespace</span>
<!--XXXSVG
   and the <span>SVG namespace</span>.</dd>
-->

   <dt>Normal elements</dt>

   <dd>All other allowed <span>HTML elements</span> are normal
   elements.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p><dfn title="syntax-tags">Tags</dfn> are used to delimit the start
  and end of elements in the markup. CDATA, RCDATA, and normal
  elements have a <span title="syntax-start-tag">start tag</span> to
  indicate where they begin, and an <span title="syntax-end-tag">end
  tag</span> to indicate where they end. The start and end tags of
  certain normal elements can be <span
  title="syntax-tag-omission">omitted</span>, as described
  later. Those that cannot be omitted must not be omitted. <span>Void
  elements</span> only have a start tag; end tags must not be
  specified for void elements. Foreign elements must either have a
  start tag and an end tag, or a start tag that is marked as
  self-closing, in which case they must not have an end tag.</p>

  <p>The contents of the element must be placed between just after the
  start tag (which <span title="syntax-tag-omission">might be implied,
  in certain cases</span>) and just before the end tag (which again,
  <span title="syntax-tag-omission">might be implied in certain
  cases</span>). The exact allowed contents of each individual element
  depends on the content model of that element, as described earlier
  in this specification. Elements must not contain content that their
  content model disallows. In addition to the restrictions placed on
  the contents by those content models, however, the five types of
  elements have additional <em>syntactic</em> requirements.</p>

  <p><span>Void elements</span> can't have any contents (since there's
  no end tag, no content can be put between the start tag and the end
  tag).</p>

  <p>CDATA elements can have <span title="syntax-text">text</span>,
  though it has <a href="#cdata-rcdata-restrictions">restrictions</a>
  described below.</p>

  <p>RCDATA elements can have <span title="syntax-text">text</span>
  and <span title="syntax-charref">character references</span>, but
  the text must not contain an <span
  title="syntax-ambiguous-ampersand">ambiguous ampersand</span>.
  There are also <a href="#cdata-rcdata-restrictions">further
  restrictions</a> described below.</p>

  <p>Foreign elements whose start tag is marked as self-closing can't
  have any contents (since, again, as there's no end tag, no content
  can be put between the start tag and the end tag). Foreign elements
  whose start tag is <em>not</em> marked as self-closing can have
  <span title="syntax-text">text</span>, <span
  title="syntax-charref">character references</span>, <span
  title="syntax-cdata">CDATA sections</span>, other <span
  title="syntax-elements">elements</span>, and <span
  title="syntax-comments">comments</span>, but the text must not
  contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (<code>&lt;</code>) or
  an <span title="syntax-ambiguous-ampersand">ambiguous
  ampersand</span>.</p>

  <p>Normal elements can have <span title="syntax-text">text</span>,
  <span title="syntax-charref">character references</span>, other
  <span title="syntax-elements">elements</span>, and <span
  title="syntax-comments">comments</span>, but the text must not
  contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (<code>&lt;</code>) or
  an <span title="syntax-ambiguous-ampersand">ambiguous
  ampersand</span>. Some normal elements also have <a
  href="#element-restrictions">yet more restrictions</a> on what
  content they are allowed to hold, beyond the restrictions imposed by
  the content model and those described in this paragraph. Those
  restrictions are described below.</p>

  <p>Tags contain a <dfn title="syntax-tag-name">tag name</dfn>,
  giving the element's name. HTML elements all have names that only
  use characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ..  U+0039 DIGIT NINE,
  U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A .. U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z, U+0041
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A .. U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z, and U+002D
  HYPHEN-MINUS (<code>-</code>). In the HTML syntax, tag names may be
  written with any mix of lower- and uppercase letters that, when
  converted to all-lowercase, matches the element's tag name; tag
  names are case-insensitive.</p>


  <h5>Start tags</h5>

  <p><dfn title="syntax-start-tag">Start tags</dfn> must have the
  following format:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>The first character of a start tag must be a U+003C LESS-THAN
   SIGN (<code>&lt;</code>).</li>

   <li>The next few characters of a start tag must be the element's
   <span title="syntax-tag-name">tag name</span>.</li>

   <li>If there are to be any attributes in the next step, there must
   first be one or more <span title="space character">space
   characters</span>.</li>

   <li>Then, the start tag may have a number of attributes, the <span
   title="syntax-attributes">syntax for which</span> is described
   below. Attributes may be separated from each other by one or more
   <span title="space character">space characters</span>.</li>

   <li>After the attributes, there may be one or more <span
   title="space character">space characters</span>. (Some attributes
   are required to be followed by a space. See the <span
   title="syntax-attributes">attributes section</span> below.)</li>

   <li>Then, if the element is one of the <span>void elements</span>,
   or if the element is a foreign element, then there may be a single
   U+002F SOLIDUS (<code>/</code>) character. This character has no
   effect on void elements, but on foreign elements it marks the start
   tag as self-closing.</li>

   <li>Finally, start tags must be closed by a U+003E GREATER-THAN
   SIGN (<code>&gt;</code>) character.</li>

  </ol>


  <h5>End tags</h5>

  <p><dfn title="syntax-end-tag">End tags</dfn> must have the
  following format:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>The first character of an end tag must be a U+003C LESS-THAN
   SIGN (<code>&lt;</code>).</li>

   <li>The second character of an end tag must be a U+002F SOLIDUS
   (<code>/</code>).</li>

   <li>The next few characters of an end tag must be the element's
   <span title="syntax-tag-name">tag name</span>.</li>

   <li>After the tag name, there may be one or more <span title="space
   character">space characters</span>.</li>

   <li>Finally, end tags must be closed by a U+003E GREATER-THAN
   SIGN (<code>&gt;</code>) character.</li>

  </ol>


  <h5>Attributes</h5>

  <p><dfn title="syntax-attributes">Attributes</dfn> for an element
  are expressed inside the element's start tag.</p>

  <p>Attributes have a name and a value. <dfn
  title="syntax-attribute-name">Attribute names</dfn> must consist of
  one or more characters other than the <span title="space
  character">space characters</span>, U+0000 NULL, U+0022 QUOTATION
  MARK (&#x22;), U+0027 APOSTROPHE (&#x27;), U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN
  (&gt;), U+002F SOLIDUS (/), and U+003D EQUALS SIGN (=) characters,
  the control characters, and any characters that are not defined by
  Unicode. In the HTML syntax, attribute names may be written with any
  mix of lower- and uppercase letters that are an <span>ASCII
  case-insensitive</span> match for the attribute's name.</p>

  <p><dfn title="syntax-attribute-value">Attribute values</dfn> are a
  mixture of <span title="syntax-text">text</span> and <span
  title="syntax-charref">character references</span>, except with the
  additional restriction that the text cannot contain an <span
  title="syntax-ambiguous-ampersand">ambiguous ampersand</span>.</p>

  <p>Attributes can be specified in four different ways:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Empty attribute syntax</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Just the <span title="syntax-attribute-name">attribute
    name</span>.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>In the following example, the <code
     title="attr-fe-disabled">disabled</code> attribute is given with
     the empty attribute syntax:</p>

     <pre>&lt;input <em>disabled</em>&gt;</pre>

    </div>

    <p>If an attribute using the empty attribute syntax is to be
    followed by another attribute, then there must be a <span>space
    character</span> separating the two.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Unquoted attribute value syntax</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The <span title="syntax-attribute-name">attribute name</span>,
    followed by zero or more <span title="space character">space
    characters</span>, followed by a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN
    character, followed by zero or more <span title="space
    character">space characters</span>, followed by the <span
    title="syntax-attribute-value">attribute value</span>, which, in
    addition to the requirements given above for attribute values,
    must not contain any literal <span title="space character">space
    characters</span>, any U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (<code>&#x22;</code>)
    characters, U+0027 APOSTROPHE (<code>&#x27;</code>) characters,
    U+003D EQUALS SIGN (<code>=</code>) characters, or U+003E
    GREATER-THAN SIGN (<code>&gt;</code>) characters, and must not be
    the empty string.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>In the following example, the <code
     title="attr-input-value">value</code> attribute is given
     with the unquoted attribute value syntax:</p>

     <pre>&lt;input <em>value=yes</em>&gt;</pre>

    </div>

    <p>If an attribute using the unquoted attribute syntax is to be
    followed by another attribute or by one of the optional U+002F
    SOLIDUS (<code>/</code>) characters allowed in step 6 of the <span
    title="syntax-start-tag">start tag</span> syntax above, then there
    must be a <span>space character</span> separating the two.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Single-quoted attribute value syntax</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The <span title="syntax-attribute-name">attribute name</span>,
    followed by zero or more <span title="space character">space
    characters</span>, followed by a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN
    character, followed by zero or more <span title="space
    character">space characters</span>, followed by a single U+0027
    APOSTROPHE (<code>'</code>) character, followed by the <span
    title="syntax-attribute-value">attribute value</span>, which, in
    addition to the requirements given above for attribute values,
    must not contain any literal U+0027 APOSTROPHE (<code>'</code>)
    characters, and finally followed by a second single U+0027
    APOSTROPHE (<code>'</code>) character.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>In the following example, the <code
     title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is given with the
     single-quoted attribute value syntax:</p>

     <pre>&lt;input <em>type='checkbox'</em>&gt;</pre>

    </div>

    <p>If an attribute using the single-quoted attribute syntax is to
    be followed by another attribute, then there must be a <span>space
    character</span> separating the two.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt>Double-quoted attribute value syntax</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The <span title="syntax-attribute-name">attribute name</span>,
    followed by zero or more <span title="space character">space
    characters</span>, followed by a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN
    character, followed by zero or more <span title="space
    character">space characters</span>, followed by a single U+0022
    QUOTATION MARK (<code>"</code>) character, followed by the <span
    title="syntax-attribute-value">attribute value</span>, which, in
    addition to the requirements given above for attribute values,
    must not contain any literal U+0022 QUOTATION MARK
    (<code>"</code>) characters, and finally followed by a second
    single U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (<code>"</code>) character.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>In the following example, the <code
     title="attr-fe-name">name</code> attribute is given with the
     double-quoted attribute value syntax:</p>

     <pre>&lt;input <em>name="be evil"</em>&gt;</pre>

    </div>

    <p>If an attribute using the double-quoted attribute syntax is to
    be followed by another attribute, then there must be a <span>space
    character</span> separating the two.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>There must never be two or more attributes on the same start tag
  whose names are an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for
  each other.</p>

  <h5>Optional tags</h5>

  <p>A <code>tbody</code> element's <span title="syntax-end-tag">end

  element, or if there is no more content in the parent element.</p>

  <!-- </tfoot> -->
  <p>A <code>tfoot</code> element's <span title="syntax-end-tag">end

  <p><strong>However</strong>, a <span title="syntax-start-tag">start

  <h5 id="element-restrictions">Restrictions on content models</h5>

  <p>For historical reasons, certain elements have extra restrictions
  beyond even the restrictions given by their content model.</p>

  <p>A <code>table</code> element must not contain <code>tr</code>
  elements, even though these elements are technically allowed inside
  <code>table</code> elements according to the content models
  described in this specification. (If a <code>tr</code> element is
  put inside a <code>table</code> in the markup, it will in fact imply
  a <code>tbody</code> start tag before it.)</p>

  <p>A single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character may be placed
  immediately after the <span title="syntax-start-tag">start
  tag</span> of <code>pre</code> and <code>textarea</code>
  elements. This does not affect the processing of the element. The
  otherwise optional U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character <em>must</em> be
  included if the element's contents start with that character
  (because otherwise the leading newline in the contents would be
  treated like the optional newline, and ignored).</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following two <code>pre</code> blocks are equivalent:</p>
   <pre>&lt;pre>Hello&lt;/pre></pre>
   <pre>&lt;pre><br>Hello&lt;/pre></pre>
  </div>


  <h5 id="cdata-rcdata-restrictions">Restrictions on the contents of CDATA and RCDATA elements</h5>

  <p>The text in CDATA and RCDATA elements must not contain any
  occurrences of the string "<code title="">&lt;/</code>" (U+003C
  LESS-THAN SIGN, U+002F SOLIDUS) followed by characters that
  case-insensitively match the tag name of the element followed by one
  of U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION, U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000C FORM
  FEED (FF), U+0020 SPACE, U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (>), or U+002F
  SOLIDUS (/), unless that string is part of an <span
  title="syntax-escape">escaping text span</span>.</p>

  <p>An <dfn title="syntax-escape">escaping text span</dfn> is a span
  of <span title="syntax-text">text</span> that starts with an <span

  <p>An <span title="syntax-escape-start">escaping text span

  <h4>Text</h4>

  <p><dfn title="syntax-text">Text</dfn> is allowed inside elements,

  Text must not contain U+0000 characters. Text must not contain
  permanently undefined Unicode characters. Text must not contain

  <h4>Character references</h4>

  <p>In certain cases described in other sections, <span

  <dl>

   <dt>Named character references</dt>

   <dd>The ampersand must be followed by one of the names given in the
   <span>named character references</span> section, using the same

  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T, U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, U+005B LEFT
  SQUARE BRACKET (<code title="">&lt;![CDATA[</code>). Following this
  sequence, the CDATA section may have <span

  that the text must not contain the three character sequence U+005D
  RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET, U+005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET, U+003E

  <h3 id="parsing">Parsing HTML documents</h3>

  <p><em>This section only applies to user agents, data mining tools,
  and conformance checkers.</em></p>
 
  <p>The rules for parsing <span>XML documents</span> (and thus
  <span>XHTML</span> documents) into DOM trees are covered by the next
  section, entitled "<span>The XHTML syntax</span>".</p>

  <p>For <span>HTML documents</span>, user agents must use the parsing
  rules described in this section to generate the DOM trees. Together,
  these rules define what is referred to as the <dfn>HTML
  parser</dfn>.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p>While the HTML form of HTML5 bears a close resemblance to SGML
   and XML, it is a separate language with its own parsing rules.</p>

   <p>Some earlier versions of HTML (in particular from HTML2 to
   HTML4) were based on SGML and used SGML parsing rules. However, few
   (if any) web browsers ever implemented true SGML parsing for HTML
   documents; the only user agents to strictly handle HTML as an SGML
   application have historically been validators. The resulting
   confusion &mdash; with validators claiming documents to have one
   representation while widely deployed Web browsers interoperably
   implemented a different representation &mdash; has wasted decades
   of productivity. This version of HTML thus returns to a non-SGML
   basis.</p>

   <p>Authors interested in using SGML tools in their authoring
   pipeline are encouraged to use XML tools and the XML serialization
   of HTML5.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This specification defines the parsing rules for HTML documents,
  whether they are syntactically correct or not. Certain points in the
  parsing algorithm are said to be <dfn title="parse error">parse
  errors</dfn>. The error handling for parse errors is well-defined:
  user agents must either act as described below when encountering
  such problems, or must abort processing at the first error that they
  encounter for which they do not wish to apply the rules described
  below.</p>

  <p>Conformance checkers must report at least one parse error
  condition to the user if one or more parse error conditions exist in
  the document and must not report parse error conditions if none
  exist in the document. Conformance checkers may report more than one
  parse error condition if more than one parse error conditions exist
  in the document. Conformance checkers are not required to recover
  from parse errors.</p>

  <p class="note">Parse errors are only errors with the
  <em>syntax</em> of HTML. In addition to checking for parse errors,
  conformance checkers will also verify that the document obeys all
  the other conformance requirements described in this
  specification.</p>


  <h4>Overview of the parsing model</h4>

  <p>The input to the HTML parsing process consists of a stream of
  Unicode characters, which is passed through a
  <span>tokenization</span> stage (lexical analysis) followed by a
  <span>tree construction</span> stage (semantic analysis). The output
  is a <code>Document</code> object.</p>

  <p class="note">Implementations that <a href="#non-scripted">do not
  support scripting</a> do not have to actually create a DOM
  <code>Document</code> object, but the DOM tree in such cases is
  still used as the model for the rest of the specification.</p>

  <p>In the common case, the data handled by the tokenization stage
  comes from the network, but <span title="dynamic markup
  insertion">it can also come from script</span>, e.g. using the <code
  title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> API.</p>

  <p><img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt=""></p>

  <p id="nestedParsing">There is only one set of state for the
  tokeniser stage and the tree construction stage, but the tree
  construction stage is reentrant, meaning that while the tree
  construction stage is handling one token, the tokeniser might be
  resumed, causing further tokens to be emitted and processed before
  the first token's processing is complete.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the tree construction stage will be
   called upon to handle a "p" start tag token while handling the
   "script" start tag token:</p>

   <pre>...
&lt;script>
 document.write('&lt;p>');
&lt;/script>
...</pre>

  </div>

  <p>To handle these cases, parsers have a <dfn>script nesting
  level</dfn>, which must be initially set to zero, and a <dfn>parser
  pause flag</dfn>, which must be initially set to false.</p>


  <h4>The <dfn>input stream</dfn></h4>

  <p>The stream of Unicode characters that consists the input to the
  tokenization stage will be initially seen by the user agent as a
  stream of bytes (typically coming over the network or from the local
  file system). The bytes encode the actual characters according to a
  particular <em>character encoding</em>, which the user agent must
  use to decode the bytes into characters.</p>

  <p class="note">For XML documents, the algorithm user agents must
  use to determine the character encoding is given by the XML
  specification. This section does not apply to XML documents. <a
  href="#refsXML">[XML]</a></p>


  <h5>Determining the character encoding</h5>

  <p>In some cases, it might be impractical to unambiguously determine
  the encoding before parsing the document. Because of this, this
  specification provides for a two-pass mechanism with an optional
  pre-scan. Implementations are allowed, as described below, to apply
  a simplified parsing algorithm to whatever bytes they have available
  before beginning to parse the document. Then, the real parser is
  started, using a tentative encoding derived from this pre-parse and
  other out-of-band metadata. If, while the document is being loaded,
  the user agent discovers an encoding declaration that conflicts with
  this information, then the parser can get reinvoked to perform a
  parse of the document with the real encoding.</p>

  <p id="documentEncoding">User agents must use the following
  algorithm (the <dfn>encoding sniffing algorithm</dfn>) to determine
  the character encoding to use when decoding a document in the first
  pass. This algorithm takes as input any out-of-band metadata
  available to the user agent (e.g. the <span
  title="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span> of the document)
  and all the bytes available so far, and returns an encoding and a
  <dfn title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</dfn>. The
  confidence is either <i>tentative</i>, <i>certain</i>, or
  <i>irrelevant</i>. The encoding used, and whether the confidence in
  that encoding is <i>tentative</i> or <i>confident</i>, is <a
  href="#meta-charset-during-parse">used during the parsing</a> to
  determine whether to <span>change the encoding</span>. If no
  encoding is necessary, e.g. because the parser is operating on a
  stream of Unicode characters and doesn't have to use an encoding at
  all, then the <span
  title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> is
  <i>irrelevant</i>.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the transport layer specifies an encoding, and it is
   supported, return that encoding with the <span
   title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span>
   <i>certain</i>, and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>The user agent may wait for more bytes of the resource to be
   available, either in this step or at any later step in this
   algorithm. For instance, a user agent might wait 500ms or 512
   bytes, whichever came first. In general preparsing the source to
   find the encoding improves performance, as it reduces the need to
   throw away the data structures used when parsing upon finding the
   encoding information. However, if the user agent delays too long to
   obtain data to determine the encoding, then the cost of the delay
   could outweigh any performance improvements from the
   preparse.</p></li>

   <li><p>For each of the rows in the following table, starting with
   the first one and going down, if there are as many or more bytes
   available than the number of bytes in the first column, and the
   first bytes of the file match the bytes given in the first column,
   then return the encoding given in the cell in the second column of
   that row, with the <span
   title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span>
   <i>certain</i>, and abort these steps:</p>

    <table>
     <thead>
      <tr>
       <th>Bytes in Hexadecimal
       <th>Encoding
     <tbody>
<!-- nobody uses this
      <tr>
       <td>00 00 FE FF
       <td>UTF-32BE
      <tr>
       <td>FF FE 00 00
       <td>UTF-32LE
-->
      <tr>
       <td>FE FF
       <td>UTF-16BE

      <tr>
       <td>DD 73 66 73
       <td>UTF-EBCDIC
-->
    </table>

   <p class="note">This step looks for Unicode Byte Order Marks
   (BOMs).</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, the user agent will have to search for explicit
   character encoding information in the file itself. This should
   proceed as follows:

    <p>Let <var title="">position</var> be a pointer to a byte in the
    input stream, initially pointing at the first byte. If at any
    point during these substeps the user agent either runs out of
    bytes or decides that scanning further bytes would not be
    efficient, then skip to the next step of the overall character
    encoding detection algorithm. User agents may decide that scanning
    <em>any</em> bytes is not efficient, in which case these substeps
    are entirely skipped.</p>

    <p>Now, repeat the following "two" steps until the algorithm
    aborts (either because user agent aborts, as described above, or
    because a character encoding is found):</p>

     <li><p>If <var title="">position</var> points to:</p>

        after the 0x3C byte that was found. (The two 0x2D bytes can be

    <p>For the sake of interoperability, user agents should not use a

   heuristically decide which to use as a default.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <span>document's character encoding</span> must immediately
  be set to the value returned from this algorithm, at the same time
  as the user agent uses the returned value to select the decoder to
  use for the input stream.</p>


  <h5>Character encoding requirements</h5>

  <p>User agents must at a minimum support the UTF-8 and Windows-1252
  encodings, but may support more.</p>

  <p class="note">It is not unusual for Web browsers to support dozens
  if not upwards of a hundred distinct character encodings.</p>

  <p>User agents must support the preferred MIME name of every
  character encoding they support that has a preferred MIME name, and
  should support all the IANA-registered aliases. <a
  href="#refsIANACHARSET">[IANACHARSET]</a></p>

  <!-- XXX should all this be abstracted out so it can be used for
  <script charset=""> and <form accept-charset="">? Maybe move this
  stuff and the 'character encodings' section of the terminology
  section into its own infrastructure subsection? -->

  <p>When comparing a string specifying a character encoding with the
  name or alias of a character encoding to determine if they are
  equal, user agents must ignore all characters in the ranges U+0009
  to U+000D, U+0020 to U+002F, U+003A to U+0040, U+005B to U+0060, and
  U+007B to U+007E (all whitespace and punctuation characters in
  ASCII) in both names, and then perform the comparison in an
  <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> manner.</p>

  <p class="example">For instance, "GB_2312-80" and "g.b.2312(80)" are
  considered equivalent names.</p>

  <p>When a user agent would otherwise use an encoding given in the
  first column of the following table, it must instead use the
  encoding given in the cell in the second column of the same row. Any
  bytes that are treated differently due to this encoding aliasing
  must be considered <span title="parse error">parse
  errors</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The requirement to treat certain encodings as other
  encodings according to the table above is a willful violation of the
  W3C Character Model specification. <a
  href="#refsCHARMOD">[CHARMOD]</a></p>

  <p>User agents must not support the CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1 and SCSU
  encodings. <a href="#refsCESU8">[CESU8]</a> <a
  href="#refsUTF7">[UTF7]</a> <a href="#refsBOCU1">[BOCU1]</a> <a
  href="#refsSCSU">[SCSU]</a></p>

  <p>Support for encodings based on EBCDIC is not recommended. This
  encoding is rarely used for publicly-facing Web content.</p>

  <p>Support for UTF-32 is not recommended. This encoding is rarely
  used, and frequently misimplemented.</p>

  <p class="note">This specification does not make any attempt to
  support EBCDIC-based encodings and UTF-32 in its algorithms; support
  and use of these encodings can thus lead to unexpected behavior in
  implementations of this specification.</p>



  <h5>Preprocessing the input stream</h5>

  <p>Given an encoding, the bytes in the input stream must be
  converted to Unicode characters for the tokeniser, as described by
  the rules for that encoding, except that the leading U+FEFF BYTE
  ORDER MARK character, if any, must not be stripped by the encoding
  layer (it is stripped by the rule below).</p> <!-- this is to
  prevent two leading BOMs from being both stripped, once by the
  decoder, and once by the parser -->

  <p>Bytes or sequences of bytes in the original byte stream that
  could not be converted to Unicode characters must be converted to
  U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER code points.</p>

  <p class="note">Bytes or sequences of bytes in the original byte
  stream that did not conform to the encoding specification
  (e.g. invalid UTF-8 byte sequences in a UTF-8 input stream) are
  errors that conformance checkers are expected to report.</p>

  <p>One leading U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK character must be ignored if
  any are present.</p>

  <p>All U+0000 NULL characters in the input must be replaced by
  U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs. Any occurrences of such characters is
  a <span>parse error</span>.</p>

  <p>Any occurrences of any characters in the ranges U+0001 to U+0008,
  <!-- HT, LF allowed --> <!-- U+000B is in the next list --> <!-- FF,
  CR allowed --> U+000E to U+001F, <!-- ASCII allowed --> U+007F
  <!--to U+0084, (U+0085 NEL not allowed), U+0086--> to U+009F, U+D800
  to U+DFFF<!-- surrogates not allowed -->, U+FDD0 to U+FDEF, and
  characters U+000B, U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, U+2FFFE,
  U+2FFFF, U+3FFFE, U+3FFFF, U+4FFFE, U+4FFFF, U+5FFFE, U+5FFFF,
  U+6FFFE, U+6FFFF, U+7FFFE, U+7FFFF, U+8FFFE, U+8FFFF, U+9FFFE,
  U+9FFFF, U+AFFFE, U+AFFFF, U+BFFFE, U+BFFFF, U+CFFFE, U+CFFFF,
  U+DFFFE, U+DFFFF, U+EFFFE, U+EFFFF, U+FFFFE, U+FFFFF, U+10FFFE, and
  U+10FFFF are <span title="parse error">parse errors</span>. (These
  are all control characters or permanently undefined Unicode
  characters.)</p>

  <p>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters and U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
  characters are treated specially. Any CR characters that are
  followed by LF characters must be removed, and any CR characters not
  followed by LF characters must be converted to LF characters. Thus,
  newlines in HTML DOMs are represented by LF characters, and there
  are never any CR characters in the input to the
  <span>tokenization</span> stage.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>next input character</dfn> is the first character in the
  input stream that has not yet been <dfn>consumed</dfn>. Initially,
  the <i>next input character</i> is the first character in the
  input. The <dfn>current input character</dfn> is the last character
  to have been <i>consumed</i>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>insertion point</dfn> is the position (just before a
  character or just before the end of the input stream) where content
  inserted using <code
  title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> is actually
  inserted. The insertion point is relative to the position of the
  character immediately after it, it is not an absolute offset into
  the input stream. Initially, the insertion point is
  uninitialized.</p>

  <p>The "EOF" character in the tables below is a conceptual character
  representing the end of the <span>input stream</span>. If the parser
  is a <span>script-created parser</span>, then the end of the
  <span>input stream</span> is reached when an <dfn>explicit "EOF"
  character</dfn> (inserted by the <code
  title="dom-document-close">document.close()</code> method) is
  consumed. Otherwise, the "EOF" character is not a real character in
  the stream, but rather the lack of any further characters.</p>


  <h5>Changing the encoding while parsing</h5>

  <p>When the parser requires the user agent to <dfn>change the
  encoding</dfn>, it must run the following steps. This might happen
  if the <span>encoding sniffing algorithm</span> described above
  failed to find an encoding, or if it found an encoding that was not
  the actual encoding of the file.</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If the new encoding is a UTF-16 encoding, change it to
   UTF-8.</li>

   <li>If the new encoding is identical or equivalent to the encoding
   that is already being used to interpret the input stream, then set
   the <span title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> to
   <i>confident</i> and abort these steps. This happens when the
   encoding information found in the file matches what the
   <span>encoding sniffing algorithm</span> determined to be the
   encoding, and in the second pass through the parser if the first
   pass found that the encoding sniffing algorithm described in the
   earlier section failed to find the right encoding.</li>

   <li>If all the bytes up to the last byte converted by the current
   decoder have the same Unicode interpretations in both the current
   encoding and the new encoding, and if the user agent supports
   changing the converter on the fly, then the user agent may change
   to the new converter for the encoding on the fly. Set the
   <span>document's character encoding</span> and the encoding used to
   convert the input stream to the new encoding, set the <span
   title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> to
   <i>confident</i>, and abort these steps.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, <span>navigate</span> to the document again, with
   <span>replacement enabled</span>, and using the same <span>source
   browsing context</span>, but this time skip the <span>encoding
   sniffing algorithm</span> and instead just set the encoding to the
   new encoding and the <span
   title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> to
   <i>confident</i>. Whenever possible, this should be done without
   actually contacting the network layer (the bytes should be
   re-parsed from memory), even if, e.g., the document is marked as
   not being cacheable. If this is not possible and contacting the
   network layer would involve repeating a request that uses a method
   other than HTTP GET (<span title="concept-http-equivalent-get">or
   equivalent</span> for non-HTTP URLs), then instead set the <span
   title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> to
   <i>confident</i> and ignore the new encoding. The resource will be
   misinterpreted. User agents may notify the user of the situation,
   to aid in application development.</li>

  </ol>



  <h4>Parse state</h4>

  <h5>The insertion mode</h5>

  <p>The <dfn>insertion mode</dfn> is a flag that controls the primary
  operation of the tree construction stage.</p>

  <p>Initially the <span>insertion mode</span> is "<span
  title="insertion mode: initial">initial</span>". It can change to
  "<span title="insertion mode: before html">before html</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: before head">before head</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: in head">in head</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in head noscript">in head noscript</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: after head">after head</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in body">in body</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in CDATA/RCDATA">in CDATA/RCDATA</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: in table">in table</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in caption">in caption</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in column group">in column group</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: in table body">in table body</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: in row">in row</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in cell">in cell</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in select">in select</span>", "<span
  title="insertion mode: in select in table">in select in
  table</span>", "<span title="insertion mode: in foreign content">in
  foreign content</span>", "<span title="insertion mode: after
  body">after body</span>", "<span title="insertion mode: in
  frameset">in frameset</span>", "<span title="insertion mode: after
  frameset">after frameset</span>", "<span title="insertion mode:
  after after body">after after body</span>", and "<span
  title="insertion mode: after after frameset">after after
  frameset</span>" during the course of the parsing, as described in
  the <span>tree construction</span> stage. The insertion mode affects
  how tokens are processed and whether CDATA sections are
  supported.</p>

  <p>Seven of these modes, namely "<span title="insertion mode: in
  head">in head</span>", "<span title="insertion mode: in body">in
  body</span>", "<span title="insertion mode: in CDATA/RCDATA">in
  CDATA/RCDATA</span>", "<span title="insertion mode: in table">in
  table</span>", "<span title="insertion mode: in table body">in table
  body</span>", "<span title="insertion mode: in row">in row</span>",
  "<span title="insertion mode: in cell">in cell</span>", and "<span
  title="insertion mode: in select">in select</span>", are special, in
  that the other modes defer to them at various times. When the
  algorithm below says that the user agent is to do something
  "<dfn>using the rules for</dfn> the <var title="">m</var> insertion
  mode", where <var title="">m</var> is one of these modes, the user
  agent must use the rules described under the <var title="">m</var>
  <span>insertion mode</span>'s section, but must leave the
  <span>insertion mode</span> unchanged unless the rules in <var
  title="">m</var> themselves switch the <span>insertion mode</span>
  to a new value.</p>

  <p>When the insertion mode is switched to "<span title="insertion
  mode: in CDATA/RCDATA">in CDATA/RCDATA</span>", the <dfn>original
  insertion mode</dfn> is also set. This is the insertion mode to
  which the tree construction stage will return when the corresponding
  end tag is parsed.</p>

  <p>When the insertion mode is switched to "<span title="insertion
  mode: in foreign content">in foreign content</span>", the
  <dfn>secondary insertion mode</dfn> is also set. This secondary mode
  is used within the rules for the "<span title="insertion mode: in
  foreign content">in foreign content</span>" mode to handle HTML
  (i.e. not foreign) content.</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>reset the insertion

  </ol>


  <h5>The stack of open elements</h5>

  <p>Initially the <dfn>stack of open elements</dfn> is empty. The
  stack grows downwards; the topmost node on the stack is the first
  one added to the stack, and the bottommost node of the stack is the
  most recently added node in the stack (notwithstanding when the
  stack is manipulated in a random access fashion as part of <a
  href="#adoptionAgency">the handling for misnested tags</a>).</p>

  <p>The "<span title="insertion mode: before html">before
  html</span>" <span>insertion mode</span> creates the
  <code>html</code> root element node, which is then added to the
  stack.</p>

  <p>In the <span>fragment case</span>, the <span>stack of open
  elements</span> is initialized to contain an <code>html</code>
  element that is created as part of <span title="html fragment
  parsing algorithm">that algorithm</span>. (The <span>fragment
  case</span> skips the "<span title="insertion mode: before
  html">before html</span>" <span>insertion mode</span>.)</p>

  <p>The <code>html</code> node, however it is created, is the topmost
  node of the stack. It never gets popped off the stack.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>current node</dfn> is the bottommost node in this
  stack.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>current table</dfn> is the last <code>table</code>
  element in the <span>stack of open elements</span>, if there is
  one. If there is no <code>table</code> element in the <span>stack of
  open elements</span> (<span>fragment case</span>), then the
  <span>current table</span> is the first element in the <span>stack
  of open elements</span> (the <code>html</code> element).</p>

  <p>Elements in the stack fall into the following categories:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn>Special</dfn></dt>

   <dd><p>The following HTML elements have varying levels of special

   <dt><dfn>Phrasing</dfn></dt>
   <dd><p>All other elements found while parsing an HTML

  </dl>

  <p>The <span>stack of open elements</span> is said to <dfn
  title="has an element in scope">have an element in scope</dfn> when
  the following algorithm terminates in a match state:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Initialize <var title="">node</var> to be the <span>current
   node</span> (the bottommost node of the stack).</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">node</var> is the target node, terminate in
   a match state.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if <var title="">node</var> is one of the
   following elements, terminate in a failure state:</p>
    <ul class="brief">
     <li><code>applet</code> in the HTML namespace</li>
     <li><code>caption</code> in the HTML namespace</li>
     <li><code>html</code> in the HTML namespace</li> <!-- (This can only happen if the <var title="">node</var> is the topmost node of the <span>stack of open elements</span>, and prevents the next step from being invoked if there are no more elements in the stack.) -->
     <li><code>table</code> in the HTML namespace</li>
     <li><code>td</code> in the HTML namespace</li>
     <li><code>th</code> in the HTML namespace</li>
     <li><code>button</code> in the HTML namespace</li>
     <li><code>marquee</code> in the HTML namespace</li>
     <li><code>object</code> in the HTML namespace</li>
<!--XXXSVG     <li><code title="">foreignObject</code> in the SVG namespace</li>-->
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, set <var title="">node</var> to the previous
   entry in the <span>stack of open elements</span> and return to step
   2. (This will never fail, since the loop will always terminate in
   the previous step if the top of the stack &mdash; an
   <code>html</code> element &mdash; is reached.)</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <span>stack of open elements</span> is said to <dfn
  title="has an element in table scope">have an element in <em>table
  scope</em></dfn> when the following algorithm terminates in a match
  state:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Initialize <var title="">node</var> to be the <span>current
   node</span> (the bottommost node of the stack).</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">node</var> is the target node, terminate in
   a match state.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, if <var title="">node</var> is one of the
   following elements, terminate in a failure state:</p>
    <ul class="brief">
     <li><code>html</code> in the HTML namespace</li> <!-- (This can only happen if the <var title="">node</var> is the topmost node of the <span>stack of open elements</span>, and prevents the next step from being invoked if there are no more elements in the stack.) -->
     <li><code>table</code> in the HTML namespace</li>
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, set <var title="">node</var> to the previous
   entry in the <span>stack of open elements</span> and return to step
   2. (This will never fail, since the loop will always terminate in
   the previous step if the top of the stack &mdash; an
   <code>html</code> element &mdash; is reached.)</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>Nothing happens if at any time any of the elements in the
  <span>stack of open elements</span> are moved to a new location in,
  or removed from, the <code>Document</code> tree. In particular, the
  stack is not changed in this situation. This can cause, amongst
  other strange effects, content to be appended to nodes that are no
  longer in the DOM.</p>

  <p class="note">In some cases (namely, when <a
  href="#adoptionAgency">closing misnested formatting elements</a>),
  the stack is manipulated in a random-access fashion.</p>


  <h5>The list of active formatting elements</h5>

  <p>Initially the <dfn>list of active formatting elements</dfn> is
  empty. It is used to handle mis-nested <span
  title="formatting">formatting element tags</span>.</p>

  <p>The list contains elements in the <span>formatting</span>
  category, and scope markers. The scope markers are inserted when
  entering <code>applet</code> elements, buttons, <code>object</code>
  elements, marquees, table cells, and table captions, and are used to
  prevent formatting from "leaking" into <code>applet</code> elements,
  buttons, <code>object</code> elements, marquees, and tables.</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>reconstruct the
  active formatting elements</dfn>, the UA must perform the following
  steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>If there are no entries in the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span>, then there is nothing to reconstruct; stop this
   algorithm.</li>

   <li>If the last (most recently added) entry in the <span>list of
   active formatting elements</span> is a marker, or if it is an
   element that is in the <span>stack of open elements</span>, then
   there is nothing to reconstruct; stop this algorithm.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">entry</var> be the last (most recently added)
   element in the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span>.</li>

   <li>If there are no entries before <var title="">entry</var> in the
   <span>list of active formatting elements</span>, then jump to step
   8.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">entry</var> be the entry one earlier than
   <var title="">entry</var> in the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span>.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">entry</var> is neither a marker nor an element
   that is also in the <span>stack of open elements</span>, go to step
   4.</li>

   <li>Let <var title="">entry</var> be the element one later than
   <var title="">entry</var> in the <span>list of active formatting
   elements</span>.</li>

   <li>Perform a shallow clone of the element <var title="">entry</var> to
   obtain <var title="">clone</var>. <a
   href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a></li>

   <li>Append <var title="">clone</var> to the <span>current
   node</span> and push it onto the <span>stack of open
   elements</span> so that it is the new <span>current
   node</span>.</li>

   <li>Replace the entry for <var title="">entry</var> in the list
   with an entry for <var title="">clone</var>.</li>

   <li>If the entry for <var title="">clone</var> in the <span>list of
   active formatting elements</span> is not the last entry in the
   list, return to step 7.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>This has the effect of reopening all the formatting elements that
  were opened in the current body, cell, or caption (whichever is
  youngest) that haven't been explicitly closed.</p>

  <p class="note">The way this specification is written, the
  <span>list of active formatting elements</span> always consists of
  elements in chronological order with the least recently added
  element first and the most recently added element last (except for
  while steps 8 to 11 of the above algorithm are being executed, of
  course).</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>clear the list of
  active formatting elements up to the last marker</dfn>, the UA must
  perform the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Let <var title="">entry</var> be the last (most recently added)
   entry in the <span>list of active formatting elements</span>.</li>

   <li>Remove <var title="">entry</var> from the <span>list of active
   formatting elements</span>.</li>

   <li>If <var title="">entry</var> was a marker, then stop the
   algorithm at this point. The list has been cleared up to the last
   marker.</li>

   <li>Go to step 1.</li>

  </ol>


  <h5>The element pointers</h5>

  <p>Initially the <dfn><code title="">head</code> element
  pointer</dfn> and the <dfn><code title="">form</code> element
  pointer</dfn> are both null.</p>

  <p>Once a <code>head</code> element has been parsed (whether
  implicitly or explicitly) the <span><code title="">head</code>
  element pointer</span> gets set to point to this node.</p>

  <p>The <span><code title="">form</code> element pointer</span>
  points to the last <code>form</code> element that was opened and
  whose end tag has not yet been seen. It is used to make form
  controls associate with forms in the face of dramatically bad
  markup, for historical reasons.</p>


  <h5>Other parsing state flags</h5>

  <p>The <dfn>scripting flag</dfn> is set to "enabled" if the <span
  title="concept-n-script">scripting was enabled</span> for the
  <code>Document</code> with which the parser is associated when the
  parser was created, and "disabled" otherwise.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>frameset-ok flag</dfn> is set to "ok" when the parser is
  created. It is set to "not ok" after certain tokens are seen.</p>


  <h4><dfn>Tokenization</dfn></h4>

  <p>Implementations must act as if they used the following state
  machine to tokenise HTML. The state machine must start in the
  <span>data state</span>. Most states consume a single character,
  which may have various side-effects, and either switches the state
  machine to a new state to <em>reconsume</em> the same character, or
  switches it to a new state (to consume the next character), or
  repeats the same state (to consume the next character). Some states
  have more complicated behavior and can consume several characters
  before switching to another state.</p>

  <p>The exact behavior of certain states depends on a <dfn>content
  model flag</dfn> that is set after certain tokens are emitted. The
  flag has several states: <i title="">PCDATA</i>, <i
  title="">RCDATA</i>, <i title="">CDATA</i>, and <i
  title="">PLAINTEXT</i>. Initially it must be in the PCDATA
  state. In the RCDATA and CDATA states, a further <dfn>escape
  flag</dfn> is used to control the behavior of the tokeniser. It is
  either true or false, and initially must be set to the false
  state. The <span>insertion mode</span> and the <span>stack of open
  elements</span> also affects tokenization.</p>

  <p>The output of the tokenization step is a series of zero or more
  of the following tokens: DOCTYPE, start tag, end tag, comment,
  character, end-of-file. DOCTYPE tokens have a name, a public
  identifier, a system identifier, and a <i>force-quirks
  flag</i>. When a DOCTYPE token is created, its name, public
  identifier, and system identifier must be marked as missing (which
  is a distinct state from the empty string), and the <i>force-quirks
  flag</i> must be set to <i>off</i> (its other state is
  <i>on</i>). Start and end tag tokens have a tag name, a
  <i>self-closing flag</i>, and a list of attributes, each of which
  has a name and a value. When a start or end tag token is created,
  its <i>self-closing flag</i> must be unset (its other state is that
  it be set), and its attributes list must be empty. Comment and
  character tokens have data.</p>

  <p>When a token is emitted, it must immediately be handled by the
  <span>tree construction</span> stage. The tree construction stage
  can affect the state of the <span>content model flag</span>, and can
  insert additional characters into the stream. (For example, the
  <code>script</code> element can result in scripts executing and
  using the <span>dynamic markup insertion</span> APIs to insert
  characters into the stream being tokenised.)</p>

  <p>When a start tag token is emitted with its <i>self-closing
  flag</i> set, if the flag is not <dfn title="acknowledge
  self-closing flag">acknowledged</dfn> when it is processed by the
  tree construction stage, that is a <span>parse error</span>.</p>

  <p>When an end tag token is emitted, the <span>content model
  flag</span> must be switched to the PCDATA state.</p>

  <p>When an end tag token is emitted with attributes, that is a
  <span>parse error</span>.</p>

  <p>When an end tag token is emitted with its <i>self-closing
  flag</i> set, that is a <span>parse error</span>.</p>

  <p>Before each step of the tokeniser, the user agent must first
  check the <span>parser pause flag</span>. If it is true, then the
  tokeniser must abort the processing of any nested invocations of the
  tokeniser, yielding control back to the caller. If it is false, then
  the user agent may then check to see if either one of the scripts in
  the <span>list of scripts that will execute as soon as
  possible</span> or the first script in the <span>list of scripts
  that will execute asynchronously</span>, has <span>completed
  loading</span>. If one has, then it must be <span title="executing a
  script block">executed</span> and removed from its list.</p>

  <p>The tokeniser state machine consists of the states defined in the
  following subsections.</p>

  <!-- XXX should go through these reordering the entries so that
  they're in some consistent order, like, by Unicode, errors last, or
  something -->

  <h4><dfn>Tree construction</dfn></h4>

  <p>The input to the tree construction stage is a sequence of tokens
  from the <span>tokenization</span> stage. The tree construction
  stage is associated with a DOM <code>Document</code> object when a
  parser is created. The "output" of this stage consists of
  dynamically modifying or extending that document's DOM tree.</p>

  <p>This specification does not define when an interactive user agent
  has to render the <code>Document</code> so that it is available to
  the user, or when it has to begin accepting user input.</p>

  <p>As each token is emitted from the tokeniser, the user agent must
  process the token according to the rules given in the section
  corresponding to the current <span>insertion mode</span>.</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>insert a
  character</dfn> into a node, if that node has a child immediately
  before where the character is to be inserted, and that child is a
  <code>Text</code> node, and that <code>Text</code> node was the last
  node that the parser inserted into the document, then the character
  must be appended to that <code>Text</code> node; otherwise, a new
  <code>Text</code> node whose data is just that character must be
  inserted in the appropriate place.</p>

  <p id="mutation-during-parsing">DOM mutation events must not fire
  for changes caused by the UA parsing the document. (Conceptually,
  the parser is not mutating the DOM, it is constructing it.) This
  includes the parsing of any content inserted using <code
  title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> and <code
  title="dom-document-writeln">document.writeln()</code> calls. <a
  href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

  <p class="note">Not all of the tag names mentioned below are
  conformant tag names in this specification; many are included to
  handle legacy content. They still form part of the algorithm that
  implementations are required to implement to claim conformance.</p>

  <p class="note">The algorithm described below places no limit on the
  depth of the DOM tree generated, or on the length of tag names,
  attribute names, attribute values, text nodes, etc. While
  implementors are encouraged to avoid arbitrary limits, it is
  recognized that <a href="#hardwareLimitations">practical
  concerns</a> will likely force user agents to impose nesting
  depths.</p>


  <h5>Creating and inserting elements</h5>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn title="create an
  element for the token">create an element for a token</dfn> in a
  particular namespace, the UA must create a node implementing the
  interface appropriate for the element type corresponding to the tag
  name of the token in the given namespace (as given in the
  specification that defines that element, e.g. for an <code>a</code>
  element in the <span>HTML namespace</span>, this specification
  defines it to be the <code>HTMLAnchorElement</code> interface), with
  the tag name being the name of that element, with the node being in
  the given namespace, and with the attributes on the node being those
  given in the given token.</p>

  <p>The interface appropriate for an element in the <span>HTML
  namespace</span> that is not defined in this specification is
  <code>HTMLElement</code>. The interface appropriate for an element
  in another namespace that is not defined by that namespace's
  specification is <code>Element</code>.</p>

  <p>When a <span title="category-reset">resettable</span> element is
  created in this manner, its <span
  title="concept-form-reset-control">reset algorithm</span> must be
  invoked once the attributes are set. (This initializes the element's
  <span title="concept-fe-value">value</span> and <span
  title="concept-fe-checked">checkedness</span> based on the element's
  attributes.)</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>insert an HTML
  element</dfn> for a token, the UA must first <span>create an element
  for the token</span> in the <span>HTML namespace</span>, and then
  append this node to the <span>current node</span>, and push it onto
  the <span>stack of open elements</span> so that it is the new
  <span>current node</span>.</p>

  <p>The steps below may also require that the UA insert an HTML
  element in a particular place, in which case the UA must follow the
  same steps except that it must insert or append the new node in the
  location specified instead of appending it to the <span>current
  node</span>. (This happens in particular during the parsing of
  tables with invalid content.)</p>

  <p>If an element created by the <span>insert an HTML element</span>
  algorithm is a <span>form-associated element</span>, and the
  <span><code title="">form</code> element pointer</span> is not null,
  and the newly created element doesn't have a <code
  title="attr-fae-form">form</code> attribute, the user agent must
  <span title="concept-form-association">associate</span> the newly
  created element with the <code>form</code> element pointed to by the
  <span><code title="">form</code> element pointer</span> before
  inserting it wherever it is to be inserted.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>insert a foreign
  element</dfn> for a token, the UA must first <span>create an element
  for the token</span> in the given namespace, and then append this
  node to the <span>current node</span>, and push it onto the
  <span>stack of open elements</span> so that it is the new
  <span>current node</span>. If the newly created element has an <code
  title="">xmlns</code> attribute in the <span>XMLNS namespace</span>
  whose value is not exactly the same as the element's namespace, that
  is a <span>parse error</span>. Similarly, if the newly created
  element has an <code title="">xmlns:xlink</code> attribute in the
  <span>XMLNS namespace</span> whose value is not the <span>XLink
  Namespace</span>, that is a <span>parse error</span>.</p>

  <p>When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>adjust MathML
  attributes</dfn> for a token, then, if the token has an attribute
  named <code title="">definitionurl</code>, change its name to <code
  title="">definitionURL</code> (note the case difference).</p>

<!--XXXSVG
  <p>When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>adjust SVG
  attributes</dfn> for a token, then, for each attribute on the token
  whose attribute name is one of the ones in the first column of the
  following table, change the attribute's name to the name given in
  the corresponding cell in the second column. (This fixes the case of
  SVG attributes that are not all lowercase.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn>generic CDATA element parsing algorithm</dfn> and the
  <dfn>generic RCDATA element parsing algorithm</dfn> consist of the
  following steps. These algorithms are always invoked in response to
  a start tag token.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p><span>Insert an HTML element</span> for the token.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the algorithm that was invoked is the <span>generic CDATA
   element parsing algorithm</span>, switch the tokeniser's
   <span>content model flag</span> to the CDATA state; otherwise the
   algorithm invoked was the <span>generic RCDATA element parsing
   algorithm</span>, switch the tokeniser's <span>content model
   flag</span> to the RCDATA state.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let the <span>original insertion mode</span> be the current
   <span>insertion mode</span>.</p>

   <li><p>Then, switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span
   title="insertion mode: in CDATA/RCDATA">in
   CDATA/RCDATA</span>".</p></li>

  </ol>



  <h5>Closing elements that have implied end tags</h5>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>generate implied end
  tags</dfn>, then, while the <span>current node</span> is a
  <code>dd</code> element, a <code>dt</code> element, an
  <code>li</code> element, an <code>option</code> element, an
  <code>optgroup</code> element, a <code>p</code> element, an
  <code>rp</code> element, or an <code>rt</code> element, the UA must
  pop the <span>current node</span> off the <span>stack of open
  elements</span>.</p>

  <p>If a step requires the UA to generate implied end tags but lists
  an element to exclude from the process, then the UA must perform the
  above steps as if that element was not in the above list.</p>


  <h5>Foster parenting</h5>

  <p>Foster parenting happens when content is misnested in tables.</p>

  <p>When a node <var title="">node</var> is to be <dfn title="foster
  parent">foster parented</dfn>, the node <var title="">node</var>
  must be inserted into the <i>foster parent element</i>, and the
  <span>current table</span> must be marked as
  <dfn>tainted</dfn>. (Once the <span>current table</span> has been
  <span>tainted</span>, whitespace characters are inserted into the
  <i>foster parent element</i> instead of the <span>current
  node</span>.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn>foster parent element</dfn> is defined as follows: If
  there is no <code>table</code> element in the <span>stack of open
  elements</span> (<span>fragment case</span>), then the <i>foster
  parent element</i> is the first element in the <span>stack of open
  elements</span> (the <code>html</code> element). Otherwise, the
  <i>foster parent element</i> is the element before the last
  <code>table</code> element in the <span>stack of open
  elements</span>.</p>

  <p>If the <i>foster parent element</i> is the parent element of the
  last <code>table</code> element in the <span>stack of open
  elements</span>, then <var title="">node</var> must be inserted
  immediately <em>before</em> the last <code>table</code> element in
  the <span>stack of open elements</span> in the <i>foster parent
  element</i>; otherwise, <var title="">node</var> must be
  <em>appended</em> to the <i>foster parent element</i>.</p>



  <h5>The "<dfn title="insertion mode: initial">initial</dfn>" insertion mode</h5>

  <p>When the <span>insertion mode</span> is "<span title="insertion
  mode: initial">initial</span>", tokens must be handled as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>A character token that is one of U+0009 CHARACTER
   TABULATION, U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000C FORM FEED (FF),
   <!--U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR),--> or U+0020 SPACE</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Ignore the token.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>A comment token</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Append a <code>Comment</code> node to the <code>Document</code>
    object with the <code title="">data</code> attribute set to the
    data given in the comment token.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>A DOCTYPE token</dt>
   <dd>

    <p>If the DOCTYPE token's <code title="">name</code> is not a
    <span>case-sensitive</span> match for the string "<code
    title="">html</code>", or if the token's public identifier is not
    missing, or if the token's system identifier is neither missing
    nor a <span>case-sensitive</span> match for the string
    "<code>about:legacy-compat</code>", then there is a <span>parse
    error</span> (this is the <dfn>DOCTYPE parse
    error</dfn>). Conformance checkers may, instead of reporting this
    error, switch to a conformance checking mode for another language
    (e.g. based on the DOCTYPE token a conformance checker could
    recognize that the document is an HTML4-era document, and defer to
    an HTML4 conformance checker.)</p>

    <p>Append a <code>DocumentType</code> node to the
    <code>Document</code> node, with the <code title="">name</code>
    attribute set to the name given in the DOCTYPE token, or the empty
    string if the name was missing; the <code title="">publicId</code>
    attribute set to the public identifier given in the DOCTYPE token,
    or the empty string if the public identifier was missing; the
    <code title="">systemId</code> attribute set to the system
    identifier given in the DOCTYPE token, or the empty string if the
    system identifier was missing; and the other attributes specific
    to <code>DocumentType</code> objects set to null and empty lists
    as appropriate. Associate the <code>DocumentType</code> node with
    the <code>Document</code> object so that it is returned as the
    value of the <code title="">doctype</code> attribute of the

  <h4>The end</h4>

  <p>Once the user agent <dfn title="stop parsing">stops parsing</dfn>
  the document, the user agent must follow the steps in this
  section.</p>

  <p>First, the <span>current document readiness</span> must be set to
  "interactive".</p>

  <p>Then, the rules for <span>when a script completes loading</span>
  start applying (script execution is no longer managed by the
  parser).</p>

  <p>If any of the scripts in the <span>list of scripts that will
  execute as soon as possible</span> have <span>completed
  loading</span>, or if the <span>list of scripts that will execute
  asynchronously</span> is not empty and the first script in that list
  has <span>completed loading</span>, then the user agent must act as
  if those scripts just completed loading, following the rules given
  for that in the <code>script</code> element definition.</p>

  <p>Then, if the <span>list of scripts that will execute when the
  document has finished parsing</span> is not empty, and the first
  item in this list has already <span>completed loading</span>, then
  the user agent must act as if that script just finished loading.</p>

  <p>By this point, there will be no scripts that have loaded but have
  not yet been executed.</p>

  <p>The user agent must then <span>fire a simple event</span> called
  <code title="event-DOMContentLoaded">DOMContentLoaded</code> at the
  <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>Once everything that <dfn title="delay the load event">delays the
  load event</dfn> has completed, the user agent must run the
  following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><span>Queue a task</span> to set the <span>current document
   readiness</span> to "complete".</li>

   <li>If the <code>Document</code> is in a <span>browsing
   context</span>, then <span>queue a task</span> to <span title="fire
   a load event">fire a <code title="event-load">load</code>
   event</span> at the <code>Document</code>'s <code>Window</code>
   object.</li>

   <li>If the <code>Document</code> has a <span>pending state
   object</span>, then <span>queue a task</span> to fire a <code
   title="event-popstate">popstate</code> event in no namespace on the
   <code>Document</code>'s <code>Window</code> object using the
   <code>PopStateEvent</code> interface, with the <code
   title="dom-PopStateEvent-state">state</code> attribute set to the
   current value of the <span>pending state object</span>. This event
   must bubble but not be cancelable and has no default action.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The <span>task source</span> for these tasks is the <span>DOM
  manipulation task source</span>.</p>

  <!-- XXX make sure things "delay the load event" -->

  <p class="XXX">delaying the load event for things like image
  loads allows for intranet port scans (even without
  javascript!). Should we really encode that into the spec?</p>

1212                      1  Here's a tricky case from bug 22596:  <h5><li><h5>
1213                         How do we know that the 2nd <h5> should close the <LI> rather than nest inside the <LI>?
1214                         (Afterall, the <h5> is a legal child of the <LI>).
1215               
1216                         The way you know is that there is no root between the two, so the <h5> binds more
1217                         tightly to the 1st <h5> than to the <LI>.
1218                      2.  Also, bug 6148 shows this case: <SPAN><DIV><SPAN>
1219                         From this case we learned not to execute this logic if the parent is a block.
1220                     
1221                      3. Fix for 26583
1222                         Ex. <A href=foo.html><B>foo<A href-bar.html>bar</A></B></A>  <- A legal HTML
1223                         In the above example clicking on "foo" or "bar" should link to
1224                         foo.html or bar.html respectively. That is, the inner <A> should be informed
1225                         about the presence of an open <A> above <B>..so that the inner <A> can close out
1226                         the outer <A>. The following code does it for us.
1227

815             // Here's a problem.  If theTag is legal in here, we don't move it
816             // out.  So if we're moving stuff out of here, the parent of theTag
817             // gets closed at this point.  But some things are legal
818             // _everywhere_ and hence would effectively close out misplaced

822             // comments, but the same issues arise with whitespace, newlines,

  <h4>Coercing an HTML DOM into an infoset</h4>

  <p>When an application uses an <span>HTML parser</span> in
  conjunction with an XML pipeline, it is possible that the
  constructed DOM is not compatible with the XML tool chain in certain
  subtle ways. For example, an XML toolchain might not be able to
  represent attributes with the name <code title="">xmlns</code>,
  since they conflict with the Namespaces in XML syntax. There is also
  some data that the <span>HTML parser</span> generates that isn't
  included in the DOM itself. This section specifies some rules for
  handling these issues.</p>

  <p>If the XML API being used doesn't support DOCTYPEs, the tool may
  drop DOCTYPEs altogether.</p>

  <p>If the XML API doesn't support attributes in no namespace that
  are named "<code title="">xmlns</code>", attributes whose names
  start with "<code title="">xmlns:</code>", or attributes in the
  <span>XMLNS namespace</span>, then the tool may drop such
  attributes.</p>

  <p>The tool may annotate the output with any namespace declarations
  required for proper operation.</p>

  <p>If the XML API being used restricts the allowable characters in
  the local names of elements and attributes, then the tool may map
  all element and attribute local names that the API wouldn't support
  to a set of names that <em>are</em> allowed, by replacing any
  character that isn't supported with the uppercase letter U and the
  six digits of the character's Unicode codepoint when expressed in
  hexadecimal, using digits 0-9 and capital letters A-F as the
  symbols, in increasing numeric order.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, the element name <code
  title="">foo&lt;bar</code>, which can be output by the <span>HTML
  parser</span>, though it is neither a legal HTML element name nor a
  well-formed XML element name, would be converted into <code
  title="">fooU00003Cbar</code>, which <em>is</em> a well-formed XML
  element name (though it's still not legal in HTML by any means).</p>

  <p class="example">As another example, consider the attribute
  <code>xlink:href</code>. Used on a MathML element, it becomes, after
  being <span title="adjust foreign attributes">adjusted</span>, an
  attribute with a prefix "<code title="">xlink</code>" and a local
  name "<code title="">href</code>". However, used on an HTML element,
  it becomes an attribute with no prefix and the local name "<code
  title="">xlink:href</code>", which is not a valid NCName, and thus
  might not be accepted by an XML API. It could thus get converted,
  becoming "<code title="">xlinkU00003Ahref</code>".</p>

  <p class="note">The resulting names from this conversion
  conveniently can't clash with any attribute generated by the
  <span>HTML parser</span>, since those are all either lowercase or
  those listed in the <span>adjust foreign attributes</span>
  algorithm's table.</p>

  <p>If the XML API restricts comments from having two consecutive
  U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS characters (--), the tool may insert a single
  U+0020 SPACE character between any such offending characters.</p>

  <p>If the XML API restricts comments from ending in a
  U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-), the tool may insert a single
  U+0020 SPACE character at the end of such comments.</p>

  <p>If the XML API restricts allowed characters in character data,
  the tool may replace any U+000C FORM FEED (FF) character with a
  U+0020 SPACE character, and any other literal non-XML character with
  a U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.</p>

  <p>If the tool has no way to convey out-of-band information, then
  the tool may drop the following information:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Whether the document is set to <i>no quirks mode</i>,
   <i>limited quirks mode</i>, or <i>quirks mode</i></li>

   <li>The association between form controls and forms that aren't
   their nearest <code>form</code> element ancestor (use of the
   <span><code>form</code> element pointer</span> in the parser)</li>

  </ul>

  <p class="note">The mutations allowed by this section apply
  <em>after</em> the <span>HTML parser</span>'s rules have been
  applied. For example, a <code title="">&lt;a::></code> start tag
  will be closed by a <code title="">&lt;/a::></code> end tag, and
  never by a <code title="">&lt;/aU00003AU00003A></code> end tag, even
  if the user agent is using the rules above to then generate an
  actual element in the DOM with the name <code
  title="">aU00003AU00003A</code> for that start tag.</p>



  <h3>Namespaces</h3>

  <p>The <dfn>HTML namespace</dfn> is: <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code></p>

  <p>The <dfn>MathML namespace</dfn> is: <code>http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</code></p>

  <p>The <dfn>SVG namespace</dfn> is: <code>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code></p>

  <p>The <dfn>XLink namespace</dfn> is: <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink</code></p>

  <p>The <dfn>XML namespace</dfn> is: <code>http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace</code></p>

  <p>The <dfn>XMLNS namespace</dfn> is: <code>http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/</code></p>

  <hr>

  <p>Data mining tools and other user agents that perform operations
  on <code title="">text/html</code> content without running scripts,
  evaluating CSS or XPath expressions, or otherwise exposing the
  resulting DOM to arbitrary content, may "support namespaces" by just
  asserting that their DOM node analogues are in certain namespaces,
  without actually exposing the above strings.</p>




  <h3>Serializing HTML fragments</h3>

  <p>The following steps form the <dfn>HTML fragment serialization
  algorithm</dfn>. The algorithm takes as input a DOM
  <code>Element</code> or <code>Document</code>, referred to as <var
  title="">the node</var>, and either returns a string or raises an
  exception.</p>

  <p class="note">This algorithm serializes the <em>children</em> of
  the node being serialized, not the node itself.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">s</var> be a string, and initialize it to
   the empty string.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>For each child node of <var title="">the node</var>, in
    <span>tree order</span>, run the following steps:

    <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var title="">current node</var> be the child node
     being processed.</p></li>

     <li>

      <p>Append the appropriate string from the following list to
      <var title="">s</var>:</p>

      <dl class="switch">

       <dt>If <var title="">current node</var> is an <code title="">Element</code></dt>

       <dd>

        <p>Append a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (<code title="">&lt;</code>)
        character, followed by the element's tag name. (For nodes

  <p><dfn id="escapingString">Escaping a string</dfn> (for the

  contains the literal string "<code title="">--&gt;</code>", then
  when the result of serializing the element is parsed, the comment
  will be truncated at that point and the rest of the comment will be
  interpreted as markup. More examples would be making a
  <code>script</code> element contain a text node with the text string
  "<code>&lt;/script></code>", or having a <code>p</code> element that
  contains a <code>ul</code> element (as the <code>ul</code> element's
  <span title="syntax-start-tag">start tag</span> would imply the end
  tag for the <code>p</code>).</p>


  <h3>Parsing HTML fragments</h3>

  <p>The following steps form the <dfn>HTML fragment parsing
  algorithm</dfn>. The algorithm optionally takes as input an
  <code>Element</code> node, referred to as the <var
  title="">context</var> element, which gives the context for the
  parser, as well as <var title="">input</var>, a string to parse, and
  returns a list of zero or more nodes.</p>

  <p class="note">Parts marked <dfn>fragment case</dfn> in algorithms
  in the parser section are parts that only occur if the parser was
  created for the purposes of this algorithm (and with a <var
  title="">context</var> element). The algorithms have been annotated
  with such markings for informational purposes only; such markings
  have no normative weight. If it is possible for a condition
  described as a <span>fragment case</span> to occur even when the
  parser wasn't created for the purposes of handling this algorithm,
  then that is an error in the specification.</p>

  <h2><dfn>The XHTML syntax</dfn></h2>

  <p class="note">This section only describes the rules for XML
  resources. Rules for <code title="">text/html</code> resources are
  discussed in the section above entitled "<span>The HTML
  syntax</span>".</p>


  <h3>Writing XHTML documents</h3>

  <p>The syntax for using HTML with XML, whether in XHTML documents or
  embedded in other XML documents, is defined in the XML and
  Namespaces in XML specifications. <a href="#refsXML">[XML]</a> <a
  href="#refsXMLNS">[XMLNS]</a></p>

  <p>This specification does not define any syntax-level requirements
  beyond those defined for XML proper.</p>

  <p>XML documents may contain a <code>DOCTYPE</code> if desired, but
  this is not required to conform to this specification. This
  specification does not define a public or system identifier, nor
  provide a format DTD.</p>

  <p class="note">According to the XML specification, XML processors
  are not guaranteed to process the external DTD subset referenced in
  the DOCTYPE. This means, for example, that using entity references
  for characters in XHTML documents is unsafe if they are defined in
  an external file (except for <code title="">&amp;lt;</code>, <code
  title="">&amp;gt;</code>, <code title="">&amp;amp;</code>, <code
  title="">&amp;quot;</code> and <code
  title="">&amp;apos;</code>).</p>


  <h3>Parsing XHTML documents</h3>

  <p>This section describes the relationship between XML and the DOM,
  with a particular emphasis on how this interacts with HTML.</p>

  <p>An <dfn>XML parser</dfn>, for the purposes of this specification,
  is a construct that follows the rules given in the XML specification
  to map a string of bytes or characters into a <code>Document</code>
  object.</p>

  <p>An <span>XML parser</span> is either associated with a
  <code>Document</code> object when it is created, or creates one
  implicitly.</p>

  <p>This <code>Document</code> must then be populated with DOM nodes
  that represent the tree structure of the input passed to the parser,
  as defined by the XML specification, the Namespaces in XML
  specification, and the DOM Core specification. DOM mutation events
  must not fire for the operations that the <span>XML parser</span>
  performs on the <code>Document</code>'s tree, but the user agent
  must act as if elements and attributes were individually appended
  and set respectively so as to trigger rules in this specification
  regarding what happens when an element in inserted into a document
  or has its attributes set. <a href="#refsXML">[XML]</a> <a
  href="#refsXMLNS">[XMLNS]</a> <a href="#refsDOMCORE">[DOMCORE]</a>
  <a href="#refsDOMEVENTS">[DOMEVENTS]</a></p>

  <p>Certain algorithms in this specification <dfn title="feed the
  parser">spoon-feed the parser</dfn> characters one string at a
  time. In such cases, the <span>XML parser</span> must act as it
  would have if faced with a single string consisting of the
  concatenation of all those characters.</p>

  <p>When an <span>XML parser</span> creates a <code>script</code>
  element, it must be marked as being <span>"parser-inserted"</span>.
  If the parser was originally created for the <span>XML fragment
  parsing algorithm</span>, then the element must be marked as
  <span>"already executed"</span> also. When the element's end tag is
  parsed, the user agent must <span title="running a
  script">run</span> the <code>script</code> element. If this causes
  there to be a <span>pending external script</span>, then the user
  agent must <span>pause</span> until that script has <span>completed
  loading</span>, and then <span title="executing a script
  block">execute it</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">Since the <code
  title="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> API is not
  available for <span>XML documents</span>, much of the complexity in
  the <span>HTML parser</span> is not needed in the <span>XML
  parser</span>.</p>

  <p>When an <span>XML parser</span> reaches the end of its input, it
  must <span>stop parsing</span>, following the same rules as the
  <span>HTML parser</span>.</p>



  <h3>Serializing XHTML fragments</h3>

  <p>The <dfn>XML fragment serialization algorithm</dfn> for a
  <code>Document</code> or <code>Element</code> node either returns a
  fragment of XML that represents that node or raises an
  exception.</p>

  <p>For <code>Document</code>s, the algorithm must return a string in
  the form of a <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-well-formed">document
  entity</a>, if none of the error cases below apply.</p>

  <p>For <code>Element</code>s, the algorithm must return a string in
  the form of an <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#wf-entities">internal general parsed
  entity</a>, if none of the error cases below apply.</p>

  <p>In both cases, the string returned must be XML
  namespace-well-formed and must be an isomorphic serialization of all
  of that node's child nodes, in <span>tree order</span>. User agents
  may adjust prefixes and namespace declarations in the serialization
  (and indeed might be forced to do so in some cases to obtain
  namespace-well-formed XML).</p>

  <p>For <code>Element</code>s, if any of the elements in the
  serialization are in no namespace, the default namespace in scope
  for those elements must be explicitly declared as the empty
  string.<!-- because otherwise round-tripping might break since it'll
  pick up the surrounding default ns when setting --> (This doesn't
  apply in the <code>Document</code> case.) <a
  href="#refsXML">[XML]</a> <a href="#refsXMLNS">[XMLNS]</a></p>

  <p>If any of the following error cases are found in the DOM subtree
  being serialized, then the algorithm raises an
  <code>INVALID_STATE_ERR</code> exception instead of returning a
  string:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>A <code>Document</code> node with no child element nodes.</li>

   <li>A <code>DocumentType</code> node that has an external subset
   public identifier that contains characters that are not matched by
   the XML <code title="">PubidChar</code> production. <a
   href="#refsXML">[XML]</a></li>

   <li>A <code>DocumentType</code> node that has an external subset
   system identifier that contains both a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"')
   and a U+0027 APOSTROPHE ("'").</li>

   <li>A node with a prefix or local name containing a U+003A COLON
   (":").</li>

   <li>An <code>Attr</code> node, <code>Text</code> node,
   <code>CDATASection</code> node, <code>Comment</code> node, or
   <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> node whose data contains
   characters that are not matched by the XML <code
   title="">Char</code> production. <a href="#refsXML">[XML]</a></li>

   <li>A <code>CDATASection</code> node whose data contains the string
   "<code title="">]]&gt;</code>".</li>

   <li>A <code>Comment</code> node whose data contains two adjacent
   U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-) characters or ends with such a
   character.</li>

   <li>A <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> node whose target name is
   an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the string "<code
   title="">xml</code>".</li>

   <li>A <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> node whose target name
   contains a U+003A COLON (":").</li>

   <li>A <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> node whose data contains
   the string "<code title="">?></code>".</li>

  </ul>

  <p class="note">These are the only ways to make a DOM
  unserializable. The DOM enforces all the other XML constraints; for
  example, trying to set an attribute with a name that contains an
  equals sign (=) will raised an <code>INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR</code>
  exception.</p>



  <h3>Parsing XHTML fragments</h3>

  <p>The <dfn>XML fragment parsing algorithm</dfn> for either returns
  a <code>Document</code> or raises a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code>
  exception. Given a string <var title="">input</var> and an optional
  context element <var title="">context</var>, the algorithm is as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Create a new <span>XML parser</span>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If there is a <var title="">context</var> element, <span>feed
    the parser</span> just created the string corresponding to the
    start tag of that element, declaring all the namespace prefixes
    that are in scope on that element in the DOM, as well as declaring
    the default namespace (if any) that is in scope on that element in
    the DOM.</p>

    <p>A namespace prefix is in scope if the DOM Core <code
    title="">lookupNamespaceURI()</code> method on the element would
    return a non-null value for that prefix.</p>

    <p>The default namespace is the namespace for which the DOM Core
    <code title="">isDefaultNamespace()</code> method on the element
    would return true.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Feed the parser</span> just created the string <var
    title="">input</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If there is a <var title="">context</var> element, <span>feed
    the parser</span> just created the string corresponding to the
    end tag of that element.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If there is an XML well-formedness or XML namespace
    well-formedness error, then raise a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code>
    exception and abort these steps.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If there is a <var title="">context</var> element, then return
    the child nodes of the root element of the resulting
    <code>Document</code>, in <span>tree order</span>.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, return the children of the <code>Document</code>
    object, in <span>tree order</span>.</p>

   </li>

  </ol>



  <h2 id="rendering">Rendering</h2>

  <p><em>User agents are not required present HTML documents in any
  particular way. However, this section provides a set of suggestions
  for rendering HTML documents that, if followed, are likely to lead
  to a user experience that closely resembles the experience intended
  by the documents' authors. So as to avoid confusion regarding the
  normativity of this section, RFC2119 terms have not been used.
  Instead, the term "expected" is used to indicate behavior that will
  lead to this experience.</em></p>


  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>In general, user agents are expected to support CSS, and many of
  the suggestions in this section are expressed in CSS terms. User
  agents that use other presentation mechanisms can derive their
  expected behavior by translating from the CSS rules given in this
  section.</p>

  <p>In the absence of style-layer rules to the contrary (e.g. author
  style sheets), user agents are expected to render an element so that
  it conveys to the user the meaning that the element
  <dfn>represents</dfn>, as described by this specification.</p>

  <p>The suggestions in this section generally assume a visual output
  medium with a resolution of 96dpi or greater, but HTML is intended
  to apply to multiple media (it is a <i>media-independent</i>
  language). User agents are encouraged to adapt the suggestions in
  this section to their target media.</p>


  <h3>The CSS user agent style sheet and presentational hints</h3>

  specified, expected to be used as part of the user-agent level style
  sheet defaults for all documents that contain <span>HTML
  elements</span>.</p>

  <p>Some rules are intended for the author-level zero-specificity
  presentational hints part of the CSS cascade; these are explicitly
  called out as <dfn>presentational hints</dfn>.</p>

  <p>Some of the rules regarding left and right margins are given here
  as appropriate for elements whose 'direction' property is 'ltr', and
  are expected to be flipped around on elements whose 'direction'
  property is 'rtl'. These are marked "<dfn>LTR-specific</dfn>".</p>

  <p>When the text below says that an attribute <var
  title="">attribute</var> on an element <var title="">element</var>
  <dfn>maps to the pixel length property</dfn> (or properties) <var
  title="">properties</var>, it means that if <var
  title="">element</var> has an attribute <var
  title="">attribute</var> set, and parsing that attribute's value
  using the <span>rules for parsing non-negative integers</span>
  doesn't generate an error, then the user agent is expected to use
  the parsed value as a pixel length for a <span title="presentational
  hints">presentational hint</span> for <var
  title="">properties</var>.</p>

  <p>When the text below says that an attribute <var

  <p>For the purposes of the CSS table model, the <code>col</code>
  element is to be treated as if it was present as many times as its
  <code title="attr-col-span">span</code> attribute <span title="rules

  <p>For the purposes of the CSS table model, the
  <code>colgroup</code> element, if it contains no <code>col</code>

  <p>For the purposes of the CSS ruby model, runs of descendants of
  <code>ruby</code> elements that are not <code>rt</code> or
  <code>rp</code> elements are expected to be wrapped in anonymous

  <p>User agents that do not support correct ruby rendering are
  expected to render parentheses around the text of <code>rt</code>
  elements in the absence of <code>rp</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The <code>br</code> element is expected to render as if its
  contents were a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character and its
  'white-space' property was 'pre'.</p>

  <p>The user agent is expected to hide <code>noscript</code> elements
  for whom <span title="concept-n-noscript">scripting is

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the attribute's

   <li><p>If <var title="">position</var> is past the end of <var

   <li><p>If the character at <var title="">position</var> is a U+002B
   PLUS SIGN character (+), then let <var title="">mode</var> be
   <i>relative-plus</i>, and advance <var title="">position</var> to
   the next character. Otherwise, if the character at <var

   then let <var title="">mode</var> be <i>relative-minus</i>, and
   advance <var title="">position</var> to the next
   character. Otherwise, let <var title="">mode</var> be
   <i>absolute</i>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Collect a sequence of characters</span> in the range
   U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9), and let the

   <li> 

    <!-- basefont support would go here, but we removed it -->

    <p>If <var title="">mode</var> is is <i>relative-plus</i>, then
    increment <var title="">value</var> by 3. If <var

    <var title="">value</var> by 3.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">value</var> is greater than 7, let it be
   7.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">value</var> is less than 1, let it be
   1.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Set 'font-size' to the keyword corresponding to the value of

  <p>When rendering <code>li</code> elements, user agents are expected
  to use the ordinal value of the <code>li</code> element to render
  the counter in the list item marker.</p>

  <p>The <code>table</code> element's <code
  title="attr-table-border">border</code> attribute <span title="maps
  to the pixel length property">maps to the pixel length
  properties</span> 'border-top-width', 'border-right-width',
  'border-bottom-width', 'border-left-width' on the element. If the
  attribute is present but its value cannot be parsed successfully, a
  default value of 1px is expected to be used for that property
  instead.</p>


  <h4>Resetting rules for inherited properties</h4>

  <p>The following rules are also expected to be in play, resetting
  certain properties to block inheritance by default.</p>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

table, input, select, option, optgroup, button {
  text-indent: initial;
}</pre>

  <!-- arguably, the form controls' 'text-indent' lines should be in
  the sections below instead of here, but that would be far more
  complicated than this -->

  <p>In <span>quirks mode</span>, the following rules are also
  expected to apply:</p>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

table {
  font-weight: initial;
  font-style: initial;
  font-variant: initial;
  font-size: initial;
  line-height: initial;
  white-space: initial;
  text-align: initial;
}

input { box-sizing: border-box; }</pre>


  <h4>The <code>hr</code> element</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

hr { color: gray; border-style: inset; border-width: 1px; }</pre>

  <p>The following rules are also expected to apply, as
  <span>presentational hints</span>:</p>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

hr[align=left] { margin-left: 0; margin-right: auto; }
hr[align=right] { margin-left: auto; margin-right: 0; }
hr[align=center] { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }
hr[color], hr[noshade] { border-style: solid; }</pre>

  <p>If an <code>hr</code> element has either a <code
  title="attr-hr-color">color</code> attribute or a <code
  title="attr-hr-noshade">noshade</code> attribute, and furthermore
  also has a <code title="attr-hr-size">size</code> attribute, and
  parsing that attribute's value using the <span>rules for parsing
  non-negative integers</span> doesn't generate an error, then the
  user agent is expected to use the parsed value divided by two as a
  pixel length for <span>presentational hints</span> for the properties
  'border-top-width', 'border-right-width', 'border-bottom-width', and
  'border-left-width' on the element.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if an <code>hr</code> element has neither a <code
  title="attr-hr-color">color</code> attribute nor a <code
  title="attr-hr-noshade">noshade</code> attribute, but does have a
  <code title="attr-hr-size">size</code> attribute, and parsing that
  attribute's value using the <span>rules for parsing non-negative
  integers</span> doesn't generate an error, then: if the parsed value
  is one, then the user agent is expected to use the attribute as a
  <span title="presentational hints">presentational hint</span>
  setting the element's 'border-bottom-width' to 0; otherwise, if the
  parsed value is greater than one, then the user agent is expected to
  use the parsed value minus two as a pixel length for
  <span>presentational hints</span> for the 'height' property on the
  element.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-hr-width">width</code> attribute on an
  <code>hr</code> element <span>maps to the dimension property</span>
  'width' on the element.</p>

  <p>When an <code>hr</code> element has a <code
  title="attr-hr-color">color</code> attribute, its value is expected
  to be parsed using the <span>rules for parsing a legacy color
  value</span>, and the user agent is expected to treat the attribute
  as a <span title="presentational hints">presentational hint</span>
  setting the element's 'color' property to the resulting color.</p>



  <h4>The <code>fieldset</code> element</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

fieldset {
  margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;
  border: groove 2px ThreeDFace;
  padding: 0.35em 0.625em 0.75em;
}</pre>

  <p>The first <code>legend</code> element child of a
  <code>fieldset</code> element, if any, is expected to be rendered
  over the top border edge of the <code>fieldset</code> element. If
  the <code>legend</code> element in question has an <code
  title="attr-legend-align">align</code> attribute, and its value is
  an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for one of the strings
  in the first column of the following table, then the
  <code>legend</code> is expected to be rendered horizontally aligned
  over the border edge in the position given in the corresponding cell
  on the same row in the second column. If the attribute is absent or
  has a value that doesn't match any of the cases in the table, then
  the position is expected to be on the right if the 'direction'
  property on this element has a computed value of 'rtl', and on the
  left otherwise.</p>

  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th>Attribute value
     <th>Alignment position
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><code title="">left</code>
     <td>On the left
    <tr>
     <td><code title="">right</code>
     <td>On the right
    <tr>
     <td><code title="">center</code>
     <td>In the middle
  </table>



  <h3>Replaced elements</h3>

  <h4>Embedded content</h4>

  <p>The <code>applet</code>, <code>canvas</code>, <code>embed</code>,
  <code>iframe</code>, and <code>video</code> elements are expected to
  be treated as replaced elements.</p>

  <p>An <code>object</code> element that <span>represents</span> an
  image, plugin, or <span>nested browsing context</span> is expected
  to be treated as a replaced element. Other <code>object</code>
  elements are expected to be treated as ordinary elements in the
  rendering model.</p>

  <p>The <code>audio</code> element, when it has a <code
  title="attr-media-controls">controls</code> attribute, is expected
  to be treated as a replaced element about one line high, as wide as
  is necessary to expose the user agent's user interface features.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The following CSS rules are expected to apply:</p>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

iframe { border: 2px inset; }</pre>


  <h4>Images</h4>

  <p>When an <code>img</code> element or an <code>input</code> element
  when its <code title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
  the <span title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state
  <span>represents</span> an image, it is expected to be treated as a
  replaced element.</p>

  <p>When an <code>img</code> element or an <code>input</code> element
  when its <code title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
  the <span title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state
  does not <span title="represents">represent</span> an image, but the
  element already has instrinsic dimensions (e.g. from the
  <span>dimension attributes</span> or CSS rules), and either the user
  agent has reason to believe that the image will become
  <i>available</i> and be rendered in due course or the
  <code>Document</code> is in <span>quirks mode</span>, the element is
  expected to be treated as a replaced element whose content is the
  text that the element represents, if any, optionally alongside an
  icon indicating that the image is being obtained. For
  <code>input</code> elements, the text is expected to appear
  button-like to indicate that the element is a <span
  title="concept-button">button</span>.</p>

  <p>When an <code>img</code> element <span>represents</span> some
  text and the user agent does not expect this to change, the element
  is expected to be treated as an inline element whose content is the
  text, optionally with an icon indicating that an image is
  missing.</p>

  <p>When an <code>img</code> element <span>represents</span> nothing
  and the user agent does not expect this to change, the element is
  expected to not be rendered at all.</p>

  <p>When an <code>img</code> element might be a key part of the
  content, but neither the image nor any kind of alternative text is
  available, and the user agent does not expect this to change, the
  element is expected to be treated as an inline element whose content
  is an icon indicating that an image is missing.</p> <!-- there's
  also a should requirement for this case in the <img> section itself
  -->

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-image">Image Button</span> state does not
  <span title="represents">represent</span> an image and the user
  agent does not expect this to change, the element is expected to be
  treated as a replaced element consisting of a button whose content
  is the element's alternative text. The intrinsic dimensions of the
  button are expected to be about one line in height and whatever
  width is necessary to render the text on one line.</p>

  <p>The icons mentioned above are expected to be relatively small so
  as not to disrupt most text but be easily clickable. In a visual
  environment, for instance, icons could be 16 pixels by 16 pixels
  square, or 1em by 1em if the images are scalable. In an audio
  environment, the icon could be a short bleep. The icons are intended
  to indicate to the user that they can be used to get to whatever
  options the UA provides for images, and, where appropriate, are
  expected to provide access to the context menu that would have come
  up if the user interacted with the actual image.</p>

  the vertical middle of the element with the parent element's
  baseline.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-dim-hspace">hspace</code> attribute of

  from the element.</p>

  <p class="example XXX">...example with screenshot...</p>



  <h3>Bindings</h3>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>A number of elements have their rendering defined in terms of the
  'binding' property. <a href="#refsBECSS">[BECSS]</a></p>

  <p>The CSS snippets below set the 'binding' property to a
  user-agent-defined value, represented below by keywords like <code
  title=""><i title="">bb</i></code>. The rules then described for
  these bindings are only expected to apply if the element's 'binding'
  property has not been overriden (e.g. by the author) to have another
  value.</p>

  <p>Exactly how the bindings are implemented is not specified by this
  specification. User agents are encouraged to make their bindings set
  the 'appearance' CSS property appropriately to achieve
  platform-native appearances for widgets, and are expected to
  implement any relevant animations, etc, that are appropriate for the
  platform. <a href="#refsCSSUI">[CSSUI]</a></p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn>converting a character width to pixels</dfn> algorithm,
  used by some of the bindings below, returns <span>(<var
  title="">size-1</var>)&times;<var
  title="">avg</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<var title="">max</var></span>, where
  <var title="">size</var> is the character width to convert, <var
  title="">avg</var> is the average character width of the primary
  font for the element for which the algorithm is being run, in
  pixels, and <var title="">max</var> is the maximum character width
  of that same font, also in pixels. (The element's 'letter-spacing'
  property does not affect the result.)</p>



  <h4>The <code>bb</code> element</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

bb:empty { binding: <i title="">bb</i>; }</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">bb</i> binding applies to a <code>bb</code>
  element, the element is expected to render as an 'inline-block' box
  rendered as a button, about one line high, containing text derived
  from the element's <code title="attr-bb-type">type</code> attribute
  in a user-agent-defined (and probably locale-specific) fashion.</p>



  <h4>The <code>button</code> element</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

button { binding: <i title="">button</i>; }</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">button</i> binding applies to a
  <code>button</code> element, the element is expected to render as an
  'inline-block' box rendered as a button whose contents are the
  contents of the element.</p>



  <h4>The <code>datagrid</code> element</h4>

  <p class="XXX">This section will probably include details on how to
  render DATAGRID (including <span id="datagridPseudos">its
  pseudo-elements</span>), drag-and-drop, etc, in a visual medium, in
  concert with CSS. Implementation experience is desired before this
  section is filled in.</p>


  <h4>The <code>details</code> element</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

details { binding: <i title="">details</i>; }</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">details</i> binding applies to a
  <code>details</code> element, the element is expected to render as a
  'block' box with its 'padding-left' property set to '40px'. The
  element's shadow tree is expected to take a child element that
  matches the selector <code
  title="">:bound-element&nbsp;>&nbsp;legend:first-child</code> and
  place it in a first 'block' box container, and then take the
  remaining child nodes and place them in a later 'block' box
  container.</p>

  <p>The first container is expected to contain at least one line box,
  and that line box is expected to contain a triangle widget,
  horizontally positioned within the left padding of the
  <code>details</code> element. That widget is expected to allow the
  user to request that the details be shown or hidden.</p>

  <p>The later container is expected to have its 'overflow' property
  set to 'hidden'. When the <code>details</code> element has an <code
  title="attr-details-open">open</code> attribute, the later container
  is expected to have its 'height' set to 'auto'; when it does not,
  the later container is expected to have its 'height' set to 0.

  <h4>The <code>input</code> element as a text entry widget</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

input { binding: <i title="">input-textfield</i>; }
input[type=password] { binding: <i title="">input-password</i>; }
/* later rules override this for other values of type="" */</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-textfield</i> binding applies to an
  <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-text">Text</span>, <span
  title="attr-input-type-search">Search</span>, <span
  title="attr-input-type-url">URL</span>, or <span
  title="attr-input-type-email">E-mail</span> state, the element is
  expected to render as an 'inline-block' box rendered as a text
  field.</p>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-password</i> binding applies, to an
  <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-password">Password</span> state, the element
  is expected to render as an 'inline-block' box rendered as a text
  field whose contents are obscured.</p>

  <p>If an <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in one of the above
  states has a <code title="attr-input-size">size</code> attribute,
  and parsing that attribute's value using the <span>rules for parsing
  non-negative integers</span> doesn't generate an error, then the
  user agent is expected to use the attribute as a <span
  title="presentational hints">presentational hint</span> for the
  'width' property on the element, with the value obtained from
  applying the <span>converting a character width to pixels</span>
  algorithm to the value of the attribute.</p>

  <p>If an <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in one of the above
  states does <em>not</em> have a <code
  title="attr-input-size">size</code> attribute, then the user agent
  is expected to act as if it had a user-agent-level style sheet rule
  setting the 'width' property on the element to the value obtained
  from applying the <span>converting a character width to
  pixels</span> algorithm to the number 20.</p>



  <h4>The <code>input</code> element as domain-specific widgets</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

input[type=number] { binding: <i title="">input-number</i>; }</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-datetime</i> binding applies to an
  <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-datetime">Date and Time</span> state, the
  element is expected to render as an 'inline-block' box depicting a
  Date and Time control.</p>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-date</i> binding applies to an

  <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-week">Week</span> state, the element is
  expected to render as an 'inline-block' box depicting a Week
  control.</p>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-time</i> binding applies to an
  <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-time">Time</span> state, the element is
  expected to render as an 'inline-block' box depicting a Time
  control.</p>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-datetime-local</i> binding applies to an

  depicting a Local Date and Time control.</p>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-number</i> binding applies to an
  <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-number">Number</span> state, the element is
  expected to render as an 'inline-block' box depicting a Number
  control.</p>

  <p>These controls are all expected to be about one line high, and
  about as wide as necessary to show the widest possible value.</p>



  <h4>The <code>input</code> element as a range control</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

input[type=range] { binding: <i title="">input-range</i>; }</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-range</i> binding applies to an
  <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-range">Range</span> state, the element is
  expected to render as an 'inline-block' box depicting a slider
  control.</p>

  <p>When the control is wider than it is tall (or square), the
  control is expected to be a horizontal slider, with the lowest value
  on the right if the 'direction' property on this element has a
  computed value of 'rtl', and on the left otherwise. When the control
  is taller than it is wide, it is expected to be a vertical slider,
  with the lowest value on the bottom.</p>

  <p>Predefined suggested values (provided by the <code
  title="attr-input-list">list</code> attribute) are expected to be
  shown as tick marks on the slider, which the slider can snap to.</p>



  <h4>The <code>input</code> element as a color well</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

input[type=color] { binding: <i title="">input-color</i>; }</pre>

  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-color">Color</span> state, the element is
  expected to render as an 'inline-block' box depicting a color well,
  which, when activated, provides the user with a color picker (e.g. a
  color wheel or color palette) from which the color can be
  changed.</p>

  <p>Predefined suggested values (provided by the <code
  title="attr-input-list">list</code> attribute) are expected to be
  shown in the color picker interface, not on the color well
  itself.</p>



  <h4>The <code>input</code> element as a check box and radio button widgets</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

  title="attr-input-type-checkbox">Checkbox</span> state, the element
  is expected to render as an 'inline-block' box containing a single
  check box control, with no label.</p>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-radio</i> binding applies to an
  <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-radio">Radio Button</span> state, the element

  is expected to render as an 'inline-block' box containing a span of
  text giving the filename(s) of the <span
  title="concept-input-type-file-selected">selected files</span>, if
  any, followed by a button that, when activated, provides the user
  with a file picker from which the selection can be changed.</p>



  <h4>The <code>input</code> element as a button</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

input[type=submit], input[type=reset], input[type=button] {
  binding: <i title="">input-button</i>;
}</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">input-button</i> binding applies to an
  <code>input</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in the <span
  title="attr-input-type-submit">Submit Button</span>, <span
  title="attr-input-type-reset">Reset Button</span>, or <span
  title="attr-input-type-button">Button</span> state, the element is
  expected to render as an 'inline-block' box rendered as a button,
  about one line high, containing the contents of the element's <code
  title="attr-input-value">value</code> attribute, if any, or text
  derived from the element's <code title="attr-input-type">type</code>
  attribute in a user-agent-defined (and probably locale-specific)
  fashion, if not.</p>



  <h4>The <code>marquee</code> element</h4>

  <p class="XXX">...(Waiting til I've specced the DOM side of this)...</p>
  <!-- XXX attributes: height/width; direction is case insensitive; bgcolor; hspace/vspace -->



  <h4>The <code>meter</code> element</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

meter {
  binding: <i title="">meter</i>;
}</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">meter</i> binding applies to a
  <code>meter</code> element, the element is expected to render as an
  'inline-block' box with a 'height' of '1em' and a 'width' of '5em',
  a 'vertical-align' of '-0.2em', and with its contents depicting a
  gauge.</p>

  <p>When the element is wider than it is tall (or square), the
  depiction is expected to be of a horizontal gauge, with the minimum
  value on the right if the 'direction' property on this element has a
  computed value of 'rtl', and on the left otherwise. When the element
  is taller than it is wide, it is expected to depict a vertical
  gauge, with the minimum value on the bottom.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to use a presentation consistent with
  platform conventions for gauges, if any.</p>

  <p class="note">Requirements for what must be depicted in the gauge
  are included in the definition of the <code>meter</code>
  element.</p>



  <h4>The <code>progress</code> element</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

progress {
  binding: <i title="">progress</i>;
}</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">progress</i> binding applies to a
  <code>progress</code> element, the element is expected to render as
  an 'inline-block' box with a 'height' of '1em' and a 'width' of
  '10em', a 'vertical-align' of '-0.2em', and with its contents
  depicting a horizontal progress bar, with the start on the right and
  the end on the left if the 'direction' property on this element has
  a computed value of 'rtl', and with the start on the left and the
  end on the right otherwise.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to use a presentation consistent with
  platform conventions for progress bars. In particular, user agents
  are expected to use different presentations for determinate and
  indeterminate progress bars. User agents are also expected to vary
  the presentation based on the dimensions of the element.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, on some platforms for showing
  indeterminate progress there is an asychronous progress indicator
  with square dimensions, which could be used when the element is
  square, and an indeterminate progress bar, which could be used when
  the element is wide.</p>

  <p class="note">Requirements for how to determine if the progress
  bar is determinate or indeterminate, and what progress a determinate
  progress bar is to show, are included in the definition of the
  <code>progress</code> element.</p>



  <h4>The <code>select</code> element</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

select {

  and the element's <code title="attr-select-size">size</code>
  attribute <span title="rules for parsing non-negative
  integers">specifies</span> a value greater than 1, the element is
  expected to render as a single-select list box.</p>

  <p>When the element renders as a list box, it is expected to render
  as an 'inline-block' box whose 'height' is the height necessary to
  contain as many rows for items as <span title="rules for parsing
  non-negative integers">specified</span> by the element's <code
  title="attr-select-size">size</code> attribute, or four rows if the
  attribute is absent, and whose 'width' is the <span>width of the
  <code>select</code>'s labels</span> plus the width of a
  scrollbar.</p>

  <p>When the <i title="">select</i> binding applies to a
  <code>select</code> element whose <code
  title="attr-select-multiple">multiple</code> attribute is absent,
  and the element's <code title="attr-select-size">size</code>
  attribute is either absent or <span title="rules for parsing
  non-negative integers">specifies</span> either no value (an error),
  or a value less than or equal to 1, the element is expected to
  render as a one-line drop down box whose width is the <span>width of
  the <code>select</code>'s labels</span>.</p>

  <p>In either case (list box or drop-down box), the element's items
  are expected to be the element's <span
  title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</span>, with the
  element's <code>optgroup</code> element children providing headers
  for groups of options where applicable.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>width of the <code>select</code>'s labels</dfn> is the
  wider of the width necessary to render the widest
  <code>optgroup</code>, and the width necessary to render the widest
  <code>option</code> element in the element's <span
  title="concept-select-option-list">list of options</span> (including
  its indent, if any).</p>

  <p>An <code>optgroup</code> element is expected to be rendered by
  displaying the element's <code
  title="attr-optgroup-label">label</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>An <code>option</code> element is expected to be rendered by
  displaying the element's <code
  title="concept-option-label">label</code>, indented under its
  <code>optgroup</code> element if it has one.</p>



  <h4>The <code>textarea</code> element</h4>

  <pre class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

textarea { binding: <i title="">textarea</i>; }</pre>

  <p>When the <i title="">textarea</i> binding applies to a
  <code>textarea</code> element, the element is expected to render as
  an 'inline-block' box rendered as a multiline text field.</p>

  <p>If the element has a <code title="attr-input-cols">cols</code>
  attribute, and parsing that attribute's value using the <span>rules
  for parsing non-negative integers</span> doesn't generate an error,
  then the user agent is expected to use the attribute as a <span
  title="presentational hints">presentational hint</span> for the
  'width' property on the element, with the value obtained from
  applying the <span>converting a character width to pixels</span>
  algorithm to the value of the attribute and then adding the width of
  a scroll bar.</p>

  <p>If the element has a <code title="attr-input-rows">rows</code>
  attribute, and parsing that attribute's value using the <span>rules
  for parsing non-negative integers</span> doesn't generate an error,
  then the user agent is expected to use the attribute as a <span
  title="presentational hints">presentational hint</span> for the
  'height' property on the element, with the value being the specified
  number of lines, plus the height of a scrollbar.</p>



  <h3>Frames and framesets</h3>

  <p>When an <code>html</code> element's second child element is a
  <code>frameset</code> element, the user agent is expected to render
  the <code>frameset</code> element as described below across the
  surface of the <span>view</span>, instead of applying the usual CSS
  rendering rules.</p>

  <p>When rendering a <code>frameset</code> on a surface, the user
  agent is expected to use the following layout algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>The <var title="">cols</var> and <var title="">rows</var>
    variables are lists of zero or more pairs consisting of a number
    and a unit, the unit being one of <i>percentage</i>,
    <i>relative</i>, and <i>absolute</i>.</p>

    <p>Use the <span>rules for parsing a list of dimensions</span> to
    parse the value of the element's <code
    title="attr-frameset-cols">cols</code> attribute, if there is
    one. Let <var title="">cols</var> be the result, or an empty list
    if there is no such attribute.</p>

    <p>Use the <span>rules for parsing a list of dimensions</span> to
    parse the value of the element's <code
    title="attr-frameset-rows">rows</code> attribute, if there is
    one. Let <var title="">rows</var> be the result, or an empty list
    if there is no such attribute.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>For any of the entries in <var title="">cols</var> or <var
    title="">rows</var> that have the number zero and the unit
    <i>relative</i>, change the entry's number to one.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">cols</var> has no entries, then add a single
    entry consisting of the value 1 and the unit <i>relative</i> to
    <var title="">cols</var>.</p>

    <p>If <var title="">rows</var> has no entries, then add a single
    entry consisting of the value 1 and the unit <i>relative</i> to
    <var title="">rows</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Invoke the algorithm defined below to <span>convert a list of
    dimensions to a list of pixel values</span> using <var
    title="">cols</var> as the input list, and the width of the
    surface that the <code>frameset</code> is being rendered into, in
    CSS pixels, as the input dimension. Let <var title="">sized
    cols</var> be the resulting list.</p>

    <p>Invoke the algorithm defined below to <span>convert a list of
    dimensions to a list of pixel values</span> using <var
    title="">rows</var> as the input list, and the height of the
    surface that the <code>frameset</code> is being rendered into, in
    CSS pixels, as the input dimension. Let <var title="">sized
    rows</var> be the resulting list.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Split the surface into a grid of <span title=""><var
    title="">w</var>&times;<var title="">h</var></span> rectangles,
    where <var title="">w</var> is the number of entries in <var
    title="">sized cols</var> and <var title="">h</var> is the number
    of entries in <var title="">sized rows</var>.</p>

    <p>Size the columns so that each column in the grid is as many CSS
    pixels wide as the corresponding entry in the <var title="">sized
    cols</var> list.</p>

    <p>Size the rows so that each row in the grid is as many CSS
    pixels high as the corresponding entry in the <var title="">sized
    rows</var> list.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">children</var> be the list of
    <code>frame</code> and <code>frameset</code> elements that are
    children of the <code>frameset</code> element for which the
    algorithm was invoked.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>For each row of the grid of rectangles created in the previous
    step, from top to bottom, run these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>

      <p>For each rectangle in the row, from left to right, run these
      substeps:</p>

      <ol>

       <li>

        <p>If there are any elements left in <var
        title="">children</var>, take the first element in the list,
        and assign it to the rectangle.</p>

        <p>If this is a <code>frameset</code> element, then recurse
        the entire <code>frameset</code> layout algorithm for that
        <code>frameset</code> element, with the rectangle as the
        surface.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, it is a <code>frame</code> element; create a
        <span>nested browsing context</span> sized to fit the
        rectangle.</p>

       </li>

       <li>

        <p>If there are any elements left in <var
        title="">children</var>, remove the first element from <var
        title="">children</var>.</p>

      </ol>

     </li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <code>frameset</code> element <span>has a border</span>,
    draw an outer set of borders around the rectangles, using the
    element's <span>frame border color</span>.</p>

    <p>For each rectangle, if there is an element assigned to that
    rectangle, and that element <span>has a border</span>, draw an
    inner set of borders around that rectangle, using the
    element's <span>frame border color</span>.</p>

    <p>For each (visible) border that does not abut a rectangle that
    is assigned a <code>frame</code> element with a <code
    title="attr-frame-noresize">noresize</code> attribute (including
    rectangles in further nested <code>frameset</code> elements), the
    user agent is expected to allow the user to move the border,
    resizing the rectangles within, keeping the proportions of any
    nested <code>frameset</code> grids.</p>

    <p>A <code>frameset</code> or <code>frame</code> element <dfn>has
    a border</dfn> if the following algorithm returns true:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the element has a <code
     title="attr-frames-frameborder">frameborder</code> attribute
     whose value is not the empty string and whose first character is
     either a U+0031 DIGIT ONE (1), a U+0079 LATIN SMALL LETTER Y, or
     a U+0059 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y, then return true.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, if the element has a <code
     title="attr-frames-frameborder">frameborder</code> attribute,
     return false.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, if the element has a parent element that is a
     <code>frameset</code> element, then return true if <em>that</em>
     element <span>has a border</span>, and false if it does
     not.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, return true.</p></li>

    </ol>

    <p>The <dfn>frame border color</dfn> of a <code>frameset</code> or
    <code>frame</code> element is the color obtained from the
    following algorithm:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the element has a <code
     title="attr-frames-bordercolor">bordercolor</code> attribute,
     then return the color obtained from applying the <span>rules for
     parsing a legacy color value</span> to that attribute's
     value.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, if the element has a parent element that is a
     <code>frameset</code> element, then the <span>frame border
     color</span> of that element.</p>

     <li><p>Otherwise, return gray.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>The algorithm to <dfn>convert a list of dimensions to a list of
  pixel values</dfn> consists of the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">input list</var> be the list of numbers and
    units passed to the algorithm.</p>

    <p>Let <var title="">output list</var> be a list of numbers the
    same length as <var title="">input list</var>, all zero.</p>

    <p>Entries in <var title="">output list</var> correspond to the
    entries in <var title="">input list</var> that have the same
    position.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input dimension</var> be the size passed
   to the algorithm.</p>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var title="">count percentage</var> be the number of
    entries in <var title="">input list</var> whose unit is
    <i>percentage</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var title="">total percentage</var> be the sum of all the
    numbers in <var title="">input list</var> whose unit is
    <i>percentage</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var title="">count relative</var> be the number of
    entries in <var title="">input list</var> whose unit is
    <i>relative</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var title="">total relative</var> be the sum of all the
    numbers in <var title="">input list</var> whose unit is
    <i>relative</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var title="">count absolute</var> be the number of
    entries in <var title="">input list</var> whose unit is
    <i>absolute</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var title="">total absolute</var> be the sum of all the
    numbers in <var title="">input list</var> whose unit is
    <i>absolute</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var title="">remaining space</var> be the value of <var
    title="">input dimension</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">total absolute</var> is greater than <var
    title="">remaining space</var>, then for each entry in <var
    title="">input list</var> whose unit is <i>absolute</i>, set the
    corresponding value in <var title="">output list</var> to the
    number of the entry in <var title="">input list</var> multiplied
    by <var title="">remaining space</var> and divided by <var
    title="">total absolute</var>. Then, set <var title="">remaining
    space</var> to zero.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, for each entry in <var title="">input list</var>
    whose unit is <i>absolute</i>, set the corresponding value in <var
    title="">output list</var> to the number of the entry in <var
    title="">input list</var>. Then, decrement <var title="">remaining
    space</var> by <var title="">total absolute</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var title="">total percentage</var> multiplied by the <var
    title="">input dimension</var> and divided by 100 is greater than
    <var title="">remaining space</var>, then for each entry in <var
    title="">input list</var> whose unit is <i>percentage</i>, set the
    corresponding value in <var title="">output list</var> to the
    number of the entry in <var title="">input list</var> multiplied
    by <var title="">remaining space</var> and divided by <var
    title="">total percentage</var>. Then, set <var title="">remaining
    space</var> to zero.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, for each entry in <var title="">input list</var>
    whose unit is <i>percentage</i>, set the corresponding value in
    <var title="">output list</var> to the number of the entry in <var
    title="">input list</var> multiplied by the <var title="">input
    dimension</var> and divided by 100. Then, decrement <var
    title="">remaining space</var> by <var title="">total
    percentage</var> multiplied by the <var title="">input
    dimension</var> and divided by 100.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>For each entry in <var title="">input list</var> whose unit is
    <i>relative</i>, set the corresponding value in <var
    title="">output list</var> to the number of the entry in <var
    title="">input list</var> multiplied by <var title="">remaining
    space</var> and divided by <var title="">total relative</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var title="">output list</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>User agents working with integer values for frame widths (as
  opposed to user agents that can lay frames out with subpixel
  accuracy) are expected to distribute the remainder first the last
  entry whose unit is <i>relative</i>, then equally (not
  proportionally) to each entry whose unit is <i>percentage</i>, then
  equally (not proportionally) to each entry whose unit is
  <i>absolute</i>, and finally, failing all else, to the last
  entry.</p>



  <h3>Interactive media</h3>


  <h4>Links, forms, and navigation</h4>

  <p>User agents are expected to allow the user to control aspects of
  <span>hyperlink</span> activation and <span>form submission</span>,
  such as which <span>browsing context</span> is to be used for the
  subsequent <span title="navigate">navigation</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to allow users to discover the
  destination of <span title="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span> and of
  <span title="form">forms</span> before triggering their <span
  title="navigate">navigation</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to inform the user of whether a
  <span>hyperlink</span> includes <span>hyperlink auditing</span>, and
  to let them know at a minimum which domains will be contacted as
  part of such auditing.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to allow users to <span>navigate</span>
  <span title="browsing context">browsing contexts</span> to the
  resources <span title="resolve a url">indicated</span> by the <code
  title="">cite</code> attributes on <code>q</code>,
  <code>blockquote</code>, <code>ins</code>, and <code>del</code>
  elements.</p>

  <p>User agents are expected to surface <span
  title="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span> created by <code>link</code>
  elements in their user interface.</p>

  <p class="note">While <code>link</code> elements that create <span
  title="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span> will match the ':link' or
  ':visited' pseudo-classes, will react to clicks if visible, and so
  forth, this does not extend to any browser interface constructs that
  expose those same links. Activating a link through the browser's
  interface, rather than in the page itself, does not trigger <code
  title="event-click">click</code> events and the like.</p>



  <h4>The <code>mark</code> element</h4>

  <p>User agents are expected to allow the user to cycle through all
  the <code>mark</code> elements in a <code>Document</code>. User
  agents are also expected to bring their existence to the user's
  attention, even when they are off-screen, e.g. by highlighting
  portions of the scroll bar that represent portions of the document
  that contain <code>mark</code> elements.</p>



  <h4>The <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute</h4>

  <p>Given an element (e.g. the element designated by the mouse
  cursor), if the element, or one of its ancestors, has a <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute, and the nearest such
  attribute has a value that is not the empty string, it is expected
  that the user agent will expose the contents of that attribute as a
  tooltip.</p>

  <p>U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters are expected to cause line
  breaks in the tooltip.</p>




  <h3>Print media</h3>

  <p>User agents are expected to allow the user to request the
  opportunity to <dfn>obtain a physical form</dfn> (or a
  representation of a physical form) of a <code>Document</code>. For
  example, selecting the option to print a page or convert it to PDF
  format.</p>

  <p>When the user actually <span title="obtain a physical
  form">obtains a physical form</span> (or a representation of a
  physical form) of a <code>Document</code>, the user agent is
  expected to create a new view with the print media, render the
  result, and the discard the view.</p>


  <h3>Interaction with CSS</h3>

  <!-- XXX this should be normative, so we'll have to move it out of
  this section -->

  <p class="XXX">Must define that in CSS, tag and attribute

  <h4>The <dfn><code>applet</code></dfn> element</h4>

  <p>The <code>applet</code> element is a Java-specific variant of the
  <code>embed</code> element. In HTML5 the <code>applet</code> element
  is obsoleted so that all extension frameworks (Java, .NET, Flash,
  etc) are handled in a consistent manner.</p>

  <p id="sandboxPluginApplet">If the <span>sandboxed plugins browsing
  context flag</span> is set on the <span>browsing context</span> for

  nothing).</p>

  <p>Otherwise, <span class="XXX">define how the element works,

  <pre class="idl">[XXX] interface <span>HTMLDocument</span> {
  readonly attribute <span>HTMLCollection</span> <span title="dom-document-applets">applets</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn title="dom-document-applets"><code>applets</code></dfn>
  attribute must return an <code>HTMLCollection</code> rooted at the
  <code>Document</code> node, whose filter matches only
  <code>applet</code> elements.</p>

  <h3>Conformance checkers</h3>

  <p>To ease the transition from HTML4 Transitional documents to the
  language defined in <em>this</em> specification, conformance
  checkers are encouraged to categorise errors that represent usage of
  old obsolete features that generally have no effect (as defined
  below) into a separate part of their report, to allow authors to
  distinguish between likely mistakes and mere vestigial markup.</p>

  <p>The following errors may be categorised as described above:</p>

   <li>

    <p>The <span>DOCTYPE parse error</span>, if the DOCTYPE token's

  <h2 id="no">Things that you can't do with this specification because
  they are better handled using other technologies that are further
  described herein</h2>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>There are certain features that are not handled by this
  specification because a client side markup language is not the right
  level for them, or because the features exist in other languages
  that can be integrated into this one. This section covers some of
  the more common requests.</p>

  <h3>Localization</h3>

  <p>If you wish to create localized versions of an HTML application,
  the best solution is to preprocess the files on the server, and then
  use HTTP content negotiation to serve the appropriate language.</p>

  <!-- <p>XXX example here</p> -->

<!--XXXSVG (remove next section)-->
  <h3>Declarative 2D vector graphics and animation</h3>
  <p>Embedding vector graphics into XHTML documents is the domain of
  SVG.</p>

  <!-- <p>XXX example here</p> -->

  <h3>Declarative 3D scenes</h3>

  <p>Embedding 3D imagery into XHTML documents is the domain of X3D,
  or technologies based on X3D that are namespace-aware.</p>

  <!-- <p>XXX example here</p> -->



  <h3 id="timers">Timers</h3>

  <p class="XXX">This section is expected to be moved to its own
  specification in due course. It needs a lot of work to actually make
  it into a semi-decent spec.</p>

  <p>Objects that implement the <code>Window</code> interface must
  also implement the <code>WindowTimers</code> interface:</p>

<pre class="idl">[NoInterfaceObject, ImplementedOn=<span>Window</span>] interface <dfn>WindowTimers</dfn> {
  // timers<!-- XXX use [Variadic], [Optional] from WebIDL -->
  long <span title="dom-windowtimers-setTimeout">setTimeout</span>(in <span>TimeoutHandler</span> handler, in long timeout);
  long <span title="dom-windowtimers-setTimeout">setTimeout</span>(in <span>TimeoutHandler</span> handler, in long timeout, <var title="">arguments...</var>);
  long <span title="dom-windowtimers-setTimeout">setTimeout</span>(in DOMString code, in long timeout);
  long <span title="dom-windowtimers-setTimeout">setTimeout</span>(in DOMString code, in long timeout, in DOMString language);
  void <span title="dom-windowtimers-clearTimeout">clearTimeout</span>(in long handle);
  long <span title="dom-windowtimers-setInterval">setInterval</span>(in <span>TimeoutHandler</span> handler, in long timeout);
  long <span title="dom-windowtimers-setInterval">setInterval</span>(in <span>TimeoutHandler</span> handler, in long timeout, <var title="">arguments...</var>);
  long <span title="dom-windowtimers-setInterval">setInterval</span>(in DOMString code, in long timeout);
  long <span title="dom-windowtimers-setInterval">setInterval</span>(in DOMString code, in long timeout, in DOMString language);
  void <span title="dom-windowtimers-clearInterval">clearInterval</span>(in long handle);
};

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject]
interface <dfn>TimeoutHandler</dfn> {
  void <span title="dom-TimeoutHandler-handleEvent">handleEvent</span>([Variadic] in any args);
};</pre>

  <p>The <code title="dom-windowtimers-setTimeout">setTimeout</code>
  and <code title="dom-windowtimers-setInterval">setInterval</code>
  methods allow authors to schedule timer-based events.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-windowtimers-setTimeout"><code>setTimeout(<var
  title="">handler</var>, <var title="">timeout</var>[, <var
  title="">arguments...</var>])</code></dfn> method takes a reference
  to a <code>TimeoutHandler</code> object and a length of time in
  milliseconds. It must return a handle to the timeout created, and
  then asynchronously wait <var title="">timeout</var> milliseconds
  and then <span>queue a task</span> to invoke
  <code>handleEvent()</code> on the <var title="">handler</var>
  object. If any <var title="">arguments...</var> were provided, they
  must be passed to the <var title="">handler</var> as arguments to
  the <code>handleEvent()</code> function.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, <dfn title=""><code>setTimeout(<var
  title="">code</var>, <var title="">timeout</var>[, <var
  title="">language</var>])</code></dfn> may be used. This variant
  takes a string instead of a <code>TimeoutHandler</code>
  object. <span class="XXX">define the actual requirements for
  this method, as with the previous one.</span> That string must be
  parsed using the specified <var title="">language</var> (defaulting
  to ECMAScript if the third argument is omitted) and executed in the
  scope of the <span>browsing context</span> associated with the
  <code>Window</code> object on which the <code
  title="setTimeout">setTimeout()</code> method was invoked.</p>

  <p class="XXX">Need to define <var title="">language</var> values;
  need to define that the <span title="concept-script">script</span>
  corresponding to the <var title="">code</var> argument is created
  before the timer is set up, so that the rule on pausing the ticker,
  below, makes sense.</p>

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-windowtimers-setInterval"><code>setInterval(...)</code></dfn>
  variants must work in the same way as the <code>setTimeout</code>
  variants except that if <var title="">timeout</var> is a value
  greater than zero, the <span title="concept-task">task</span> that
  invokes the <var title="">handler</var> or <code>code</code> must be
  <span title="queue a task">queued</span> again every <var
  title="">timeout</var> milliseconds, not just the once.</p> <!-- so
  setInterval(x) and setInterval(x, 0) are equivalent to setTimeout(x)
  and setTimeout(x, 0) respectively -->

  <p>The <dfn
  title="dom-windowtimers-clearTimeout"><code>clearTimeout()</code></dfn>
  and <dfn
  title="dom-windowtimers-clearInterval"><code>clearInterval()</code></dfn>
  methods take one integer (the value returned by <code
  title="dom-windowtimers-setTimeout">setTimeout()</code> and <code
  title="dom-windowtimers-setInterval">setInterval()</code>
  respectively) and must cancel the specified timeout. When called
  with a value that does not correspond to an active timeout or
  interval, the methods must return without doing anything.</p>

  <p>For both <code
  title="dom-windowtimers-setTimeout">setTimeout()</code> and <code
  title="dom-windowtimers-setInterval">setInterval()</code>, the clock
  upon which the timers are based must only tick while the
  <code>Document</code> of the <span title="script's global
  object">global object</span> of their callbacks is <span>fully
  active</span>.</p>



  <h3>Rendering and the DOM</h3>

  <p class="XXX">This section is expected to be moved to its own
  specification in due course. It needs a lot of work to actually make
  it into a semi-decent spec.</p>

  <p>Any object implement the <code>AbstractView</code> interface must
  also implement the <code>MediaModeAbstractView</code> interface.</p>

  <pre class="idl">[NoInterfaceObject, ImplementedOn=<span>AbstractView</span>] interface <dfn>MediaModeAbstractView</dfn> {
  readonly attribute DOMString <span>mediaMode</span>;
};</pre>

  <p>The <dfn><code>mediaMode</code></dfn> attribute on objects
  implementing the <code>MediaModeAbstractView</code> interface must
  return the string that represents the canvas' current rendering mode
  (<code>screen</code>, <code>print</code>, etc). This is a lowercase
  string, as <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html#media-types">defined by
  the CSS specification</a>. <a href="#refsCSS21">[CSS21]</a></p>

  <p>Some user agents may support multiple media, in which case there
  will exist multiple objects implementing the
  <code>AbstractView</code> interface. Only the default view
  implements the <code>Window</code> interface. The other views can be
  reached using the <code>view</code> attribute of the
  <code>UIEvent</code> interface, during event propagation. There is no
  way currently to enumerate all the views.</p>

  <p>Special thanks to Richard Williamson for creating the first
  implementation of <code>canvas</code> in Safari, from which the
  canvas feature was designed.</p>

  <p>Special thanks also to the Microsoft employees who first
  implemented the event-based drag-and-drop mechanism, <code
  title="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code>, and other
  features first widely deployed by the Windows Internet Explorer
  browser.</p>

  <p>Special thanks and $10,000 to David Hyatt who came up with a
  broken implementation of the <a href="#adoptionAgency">adoption
  agency algorithm</a> that the editor had to reverse engineer and fix
  before using it in the parsing section.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the many sources that provided inspiration for the
  examples used in the specification.</p>

  <p>Thanks also to the Microsoft blogging community for some ideas,
  to the attendees of the W3C Workshop on Web Applications and
  Compound Documents for inspiration, to the #mrt crew, the #mrt.no
  crew, and the #whatwg crew, and to Pillar and Hedral for their ideas

 XXX * define how to handle APNGs that have out-of-order aDATs and other
       errors in image formats, since pav and vlad refuse to define it for APNG:
         <Hixie> vlad: you should define what the UA should do with out-of-order aDATs
         <pav> its an error
         <pav> pretty sure we say that somewhere
         <Hixie> yes i know it's an error
         <Hixie> but that doesn't say what the UA should do
         <pav> error == image is invalid
         <vlad> yep
         <vlad> either broken image icon
         <vlad> or display first frame (fall back to normal PNG)
         <vlad> up to the UA
         <Hixie> right
         <Hixie> you should say which one
         <pav> its up to the UA
         <Hixie> why?
         <vlad> "SHOULD display the first frame, but MAY display broken image icon if that's not convenient", in rfc parlance
         <vlad> because it's not useful to specify that, IMO
         <Hixie> up to the UA means one UA will implement something, it'll become a popular UA, then all the others will have to copy it.
         <vlad> how a UA wants to handle image errors is up to the UA
         <pav> we're designing an image format, not the html image tag
         <pav> the html spec should say what to do with it
 XXX * <title site="" publisher="" author="">Page Title</title> ?
 XXX * <h1> styled according to section depth

 XXX * trim function in JS for strings to remove spaces
 XXX * date checking functions in JS (.isValidDate?)
 XXX * a fairly common situation for web authors is to have two lists, where
       the contents of the second depends on the value of the first. Is there
       any way we could extend the current model to include this functionality?
       (e.g. bugzilla product/component ui)
 XXX * quick-searchable select
 XXX * fallback that will only appear in non-webforms clients (e.g. for
       formats for date fields)
 XXX * include/exclude selectors (two multi-select columns with arrows to
       move selected items) and that sort of thing.

 XXX * Oh, and forms need a standardized Help widget/icon. I know I can
       turn my cursor into a question mark, but I'm looking for something
       simple and pervasive. Maybe you can wrap fields in a help tag, just
       as you do for fieldsets. And in that help tag, attributes are
       available that allow for a nice, formatted, clean, full help text
       popup/area/thing.

 XXX * Validating only part of a form. - Anja Lehmann
 XXX * Reminder to add a way to expose access keys in buttons, i.e.
       Sub&mit where & signifies the m is the access key to use. Possibly
       automatic? <input accesskey="m" value="Submit"> browser would be
       smart enough to underline the first instance of the access key if
       it exists (case insensitive)? - kerz
       [or deprecate the lot (->web apps)]
 XXX * option.text should do the same as option.textContent
 XXX * need an attribute that says "the children of this element are in
       their own tabbing universe, tabindex should be relative to each
       other, not to the document"
       -> web apps?
 XXX * make optgroups selectable if they have a value.
 XXX * make select widgets have multiple columns
       or ->web apps with list view
 XXX * required as a group (one of the following must be available):
       + i propose something like the following:
           <input type="text" group="contact" name="voicephone"> Voice phone
           <input type="text" group="contact" name="fax"> Fax
           <input type="text" group="contact" name="mobile"> Mobile phone
           <input type="text" group="contact" name="email"> E-mail
         if the user fills out none of the form fields in the "contact"
         group, an error message is shown and the form is not submitted.
         - Peter-Paul Koch
 XXX * use the sample widgets:
          <li><img alt="A text field with editable sections for each
          value, with a button to pop up a dialog showing a calendar or
          clock." src="sample-datetime-ui-2"></li>
          <li><img alt="A calendar grid with a clock in the upper right
          hand corner." src="sample-datetime-ui-3"></li>
 XXX * formatting of number fields, text fields, etc, so that when the
       field is not focused, the value is displayed differently. Seems
       like this would also be useful e.g. for <output> or something so
       you can display localised dates, etc.
 XXX * update text/html RFC
 XXX * password and confirm password: can we have a way to do client-side
       validation of this?
 XXX * <input type="search">
       http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005890
 XXX * would be nice to say how to handle duplicate IDs once and for all
       instead of spreading it all over the spec.
 XXX * being able to select date range (from day x to day y)
 XXX * ways of visualizing a linefeed in a <textarea> so it looks different
       from wrapping text
 XXX * all login systems have
         1. enter username and password
         2. create new account
         3. lost password
       some way of integrating this into one system, since it's so common
 XXX * way of identifying different sorts of mailadresses
         a) mailing-list
         b) person
         c) department in a company ("support", "marketing" and such)
         d) general mail (like "info", "mail", "contact" and such)
         e) other sorts of groupings
       (or ->web apps; this is talking about in mailto: links, I think)
 XXX * hotswapping login identities like in windows xp
         you are logged in on operamail.com, and you want to check the mail
         of another user. somehow, combined with the wand or whatever,
         the browser will remember the login page, and it can re-submit it
         without having to load the initial page (saving time)
 XXX * provide different measuring systems, like having the html indicate
       fluid in both fluid ounces and liters, and the browser can display
       one or the other based on regional settings in the browser or ui,
       display conversions in a tooltip, or let the user decide which
       format to display.
 XXX * indicate "x days ago" or "y days into the future" rather than date
 XXX * input control for anniversaries
 XXX * only submit fields that have changed, or a way to include in the
       submission a list of which form controls were changed from their
       default value
 XXX * have a way of marking the first option of a <select> as the default
       but have it not satisfy a new required="" attribute on <select> so
       that you can have selects that require a valid value.
 XXX * Dave Raggett inadvertently suggested there should be a way to submit
       canvas elements.
 XXX * type="time" value="now"
 XXX * should "mixed fractional number" be used instead of "fractional"?
 XXX * terse BNF to define the allowed values of the various attributes
       instead of, or in addition to, the prose. [or not, it wouldn't be terse]
 XXX * add something to type="number" to support basic currency and unit
       formatting of input
 XXX * <fieldset enabled-if-checked="myCheckboxOrRadioButton">
       ...to allow sections to only be enabled if a radio button makes it
       relevant, for instance.
 XXX * Yan Morin proposed a multi-column dropdown <select> or <datalist>:
         _________________
        |_New_York______|V|_________________  <- input  with a table link and a down arrow
        |_City__________|_State_|_Country_|_| <- header of the table
        | Montreal      |  QC   | Canada  |A| <- top arrow of the scroll
        |>New York     <|  NY   | US      | | <- selected row
        | Washington    |  DC   | US      |X| <- cursor scroll
        | San Francisco |  CA   | US      | |
        |_Toronto_______|__ON___|_Canada__|V| <- bottom arrow of the scroll

 XXX * add for="" attribute to <input type="password"> so that you can
       link usernames and passwords. (Jonas Sicking)
 XXX * value for unchecked checkbox?
 XXX * maximum height/width or required ratio for image uploads? - Leons Petrazickis
 XXX * A way to specify the default button - Michael Gratton 
 XXX * <fieldset readonly>?
 XXX * keygen?
 XXX * action="" should be defined as not being relative to base URI
       see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=297761
 XXX * rephrase things so that an enumerated attribute puts the _element_ into
       various states, instead of the attribute
 XXX * make the text consistent about whether it is ":<em>" and
       ":<strong>" or "</em>:" and "</strong>:". Same for other
       punctuation.
 XXX * take references to "valid mime type" / RFC2046 and make them
       mean something. (2046 doesn't define anything like that, and
       2045's definition doesn't really help either, since it's part
       of something else, and doesn't mention whitespace, etc.)
 XXX * reference [UTC] in the various places that use it.
 XXX * make codepoint vs code point consistent
 XXX * dolphinling suggests having a way to mark certain parts of a
       form as being dependent on another (mutually exclusive parts of
       a form)
 XXX * make the spec more consistent about its use of "hexadecimal"
       and "base-sixteen", the order that 0-9 A-Z a-z is mentioned,
       and the detail to which the spec explains how to interpret a
       string as a hexadecimal number.
 XXX * expose the form data set, either as an object (on which one can
       invoke the JSON serialiser), or in the form of a method on
       HTMLFormElement that returns the form data set serialised
       according to a particular encoding (defaulting to the form's
       enctype="" one, probably). This would allow forms to be used
       with XHR-like systems without having to manually construct the
       form data set the way that is done today.
 XXX * placeholder="" for <textarea>, e.g. as seen on:
       http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=1#makechanges
 XXX * become more consistent about what markup we use to mark up
       productions (nothing? <i>? <code>?)
 XXX * expose the value of a radio button group
        - either on the NodeList returned by HTMLFormControlCollection
        - or on the radio button itself
        - or both, so it works even when the form controls have names
          that vary more than HTMLFormControlCollection allows?
